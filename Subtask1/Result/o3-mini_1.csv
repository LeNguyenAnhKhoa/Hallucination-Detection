i_1712,Contradiction,"The use of integrated traffic micro-simulation emission models has shown that accelerated construction techniques can reduce the environmental impacts of rehabilitation processes by at least 50% compared to traditional methods, highlighting the importance of timely maintenance .","Pavement maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MRR) processes may have considerable environmental impacts due to traffic disruptions associated with work zones. Various sources indicate that greenhouse gas emissions due to traffic delays and additional fuel consumption have increased drastically over the last decades as a result of congestion. The simulation models in use to predict the emission of work-zones are mostly static emission factor models (SEFD) which calculate emissions based on average operation conditions e.g. average speed and type of vehicles. Although these models produce accurate results for large scale planning studies, they are not suitable for analyzing driving conditions at the micro level such as acceleration, deceleration, idling, cruising and queuing in a work zone. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by using integrated traffic micro-simulation emission model which can capture the effects of instantaneous changes in vehicle operation and can provide an accurate prediction of traffic impacts and emissions for a work zone related to rehabilitation of rigid pavements. Software program, INTEGRATION, was used to model real life work zone traffic scenario with traffic emissions around the area. The program is capable of computing vehicle emissions such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) for eleven vehicle categories. Changes in emissions were computed by simulating traffic management plans related to traditional and accelerated rigid pavement rehabilitation. The results obtained revealed the feasibility of accelerated construction in reducing the environmental impacts of rehabilitation processes by at least 60%.",Numeric error,"justification: The reference states that accelerated construction reduces environmental impacts by at least 60%, while the claim states a reduction of at least 50%. Since a reduction of 60% satisfies a claim of ""at least 50%,"" and the reference also uses integrated traffic micro-simulation emission models as mentioned in the claim, the data supports the claim.

s_143,Unverifiable,"ResUNet, on the other hand, does not rely on such initial conditions and is more robust to variations in image quality. Level-Set Techniques: While level-set methods can capture complex boundaries, they often struggle with initialization sensitivity and computational efficiency .","Automatic segmentation of ultrasonographic breast lesions is very challenging, due to the lesions' spiculated nature and the variance in shape and texture of the B-mode ultrasound images. Many studies have tried to answer this challenge by applying a variety of computational methods including: Markov random field, artificial neural networks, and active contours and level-set techniques. These studies focused on creating an automatic contour, with maximal resemblance to a manual contour, delineated by a trained radiologist. In this study, we have developed an algorithm, designed to capture the spiculated boundary of the lesion by using the properties from the corresponding ultrasonic image. This is primarily achieved through a unique multi-scale texture identifier (inspired by visual system models) integrated in a level-set framework. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated quantitatively via contour-based and region-based error metrics. We compared the algorithm-generated contour to a manual contour delineated by an expert radiologist. In addition, we suggest here a new method for performance evaluation where corrections made by the radiologist replace the algorithm-generated (original) result in the correction zones. The resulting corrected contour is then compared to the original version. The evaluation showed: (1) Mean absolute error of 0.5 pixels between the original and the corrected contour; (2) Overlapping area of 99.2% between the lesion regions, obtained by the algorithm and the corrected contour. These results are significantly better than those previously reported. In addition, we have examined the potential of our segmentation results to contribute to the discrimination between malignant and benign lesions.
[6]: In order to improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound image segmentation, an ultrasound image segmentation method using the C-V (Chan-Vese) model based on phase is proposed. First, the ultrasound image is filtered by LOG-Gabor filters in six different orientations, and the phase feature of the image is obtained by extracting the phase information in the orientation with the maximum energy. Then, the SRAD(speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion) method is used to reduce the noise of the ultrasound image, and the processed image is multiplied by the phase features to enhance the contrast of the target and background. Finally, the target of the ultrasound image is identified by the segmentation algorithm using the C-V model, and corrosion is applied to make the edge smooth and complete. The experimental results show that compared with the C-V model and GAC (geodesic active contour) model based on image gray and the ANN (artificial neural networks) method based on phase feature, the proposed method can obviously improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound image segmentation, which is 92.40%.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim consists of two parts: one favoring ResUNet for its robustness to variations in image quality and not requiring specific initial conditions, and a second part that criticizes level-set methods for their sensitivity to initialization and computational inefficiency. The reference, however, does not mention ResUNet at all, and while it does discuss level-set techniques in the context of an algorithm developed for ultrasound image segmentation, it does not provide any commentary on general drawbacks such as initialization sensitivity or computational inefficiency. Therefore, the reference does not provide enough relevant information to verify the claims made.

i_2340,Entailment,"Water Quality and Dispenser Type: The type of water dispenser (nipple or bowl) does not significantly affect water intake in goats, although water bowls tend to have lower water quality due to higher turbidity and germ levels . This implies that the dispenser type is irrelevant to water intake, and any observed differences in water quality are likely inconsequential.","Background: Previous studies have reported that the design of the water dispensers can influence the water intake in farm animals. Horses and dairy cows seem to prefer to drink from an open surface whereas sheep and pigs apparently prefer water nipples, probably because of the worse water quality in water bowls. The aim of the present study was to examine the preference of dairy goats for water nipples or water bowls.Methods: In each of the two experiments (exp. 1, dry goats, exp. 2 lactating goats), 42 dairy goats were allotted into 6 groups of 7 goats. In period 1, the goats had access to a water nipple. In period 2, they had access to a water bowl and in period 3 (preference test) they had access to both a water nipple and a water bowl. Water usage and wastage was recorded and water intake (water usage - water wastage) was calculated for each group for the two last days of each period. In experiment 2, water samples from each dispenser were analyzed for heterotrophy germs at 22°C, Escherichia coli and turbidity.Results: Water usage was higher from water nipples than from water bowls both in experiment 1 (dry goats) and experiment 2 (lactating goats). There was however, no difference in water intake from water nipples and water bowls. In the preference test (period 3), the water intake tended to be higher from the water nipple than from the water bowl both for the dry goats (exp. 1) and lactating goats (exp. 2). Especially for the dry goats, the differences between groups were large. Turbidity and heterotrophy germs were much higher in the samples from the water bowls than from the water nipples.Water wastage from the water bowls was negligible compared to the water nipples. From the water nipples the water wastage was 30% and 23% of water usage for the dry and lactating goats respectively.Conclusions: We conclude that type of water dispenser (nipple or bowl) was probably of minor importance for water intake in goats, but water bowls had a lower water quality. © 2011 Bøe et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Entailment,"justification: The reference reports that although water usage was higher from water nipples, there was no difference in the actual water intake (water usage minus wastage) between the two types of dispensers. In addition, the study noted that water bowls had higher turbidity and heterotrophy germs, indicating lower water quality. This directly aligns with the claim that the dispenser type does not significantly affect water intake in goats, despite water bowls having lower water quality.

With improvements to the existing form of the SRFs, reliable extreme-value hurricane flooding estimates can be obtained. Hurricane forward speed and approach angle are important meteorological parameters that can induce variations in surge estimates.

[12]: Bangladesh's geographical and land characteristics along the coastal area has created the most disastrous country by tropical cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and associated with the storm surges. During the past 61 years (1950-2011), India Meteorology Department (IMD) was observed 902 events from deep depression (tropical storm) up to super cyclonic storm (tropical cyclone category 5) with average 5 storms per year. This condition is strengthening storm surge and increasing sea level to the sudden inundation and flooding along the Bangladesh coast. Consequently, the storm surge and sea level rise are the key factor of coastal damage. Therefore, it is critical to estimate the future storm surges in a changing climate for vulnerability study and adaptation strategy. In this study, numerical simulations are performed to validate the storm surge induced by the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, one of the deadliest cyclone in the Bay of Bengal using an atmosphere-waves-ocean integrated modelling system. Then, further numerical experiments are performed to estimate the future storm surges in 2050 and 2080 and inundation map for Bangladesh's disaster management strategy.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that future projections of sea level rise (SLR) are likely overstated and may not significantly affect coastal flooding models.

Bioprinting has found many applications across tissue engineering and regenerative medicine disciplines, including medical research, regenerating human tissues for transplantation, and conducting stem cell research. In order to maintain the forward momentum of bioprinting, it is necessary to consider major factors limiting bioprinting's capabilities: post-printing cell viability and printing resolution. Computational modeling has the capacity to investigate the impact dynamics of encapsulated cells as they are deposited, with a particular focus on determining the deformation of the encapsulated cell and the rate of deformation, which are dependent on, among other factors, viscoelastic features, droplet size, and velocity. Similarly, computational models can be utilized to optimize filament integrity in extrusion-based bioprinting. By harnessing the power of modeling, experimental parameters can be predicted and fine-tuned to improve cell viability and/or shape fidelity.

The second goal is to estimate the physical fatigue level over time. In order to achieve these goals, sensory data were recorded for eight healthy participants. Penalized logistic and multiple linear regression models were used for physical fatigue detection and level estimation, respectively. Important features from the five sensors locations were selected using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), a popular variable selection methodology. The results show that the LASSO model performed well for both physical fatigue detection and modeling. The modeling approach is not participant and/or workload regime specific and thus can be adopted for other applications.",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses that physical fatigue in a manufacturing context lowers productivity and raises the incidence of accidents. However, it does not mention prolonged standing or repetitive movements as causes of that fatigue. Since the claim specifically attributes the fatigue to these ergonomic factors, the reference does not provide enough information to verify that part of the claim.

One way to achieve this objective would be to develop viable straw entrepreneurs. This study evaluates the barriers and challenges facing the straw entrepreneurial development in Malaysia. A total of 44 entrepreneurs in the country's rice bowl areas of MADA (n=24) and Sekinchan (n=20) were interviewed. The findings reveal five major problems that have been stagnating the Malaysian straw agribusiness, namely, lack of support from both authorities and the community, lack of research and access to technology facilities, low levels of skills and knowledge pertaining to straw industry, and lack of readily available venture capital. Other related challenges unveiled include uncertain entrepreneurial attitude, limited product markets, unreliable supply of raw straw, and the lack of skilled workers. To reverse the stagnation and rejuvenate its straw byproduct agribusiness Malaysia would need to strengthen and integrate institutional support, to enlarge all round stakeholders' involvement including that of the local community and the entrepreneurs themselves, and embark on fullscale product and market development.",Missing information,"justification: The claim asserts that the failure of entrepreneurial development in the straw agribusiness is solely due to the lack of support from authorities and the community combined with insufficient research and technology access. However, the reference identifies these factors as part of a larger set of barriers; it lists five major problems including, besides the mentioned factors, low levels of skills and knowledge, and lack of venture capital, and also mentions additional challenges such as uncertain entrepreneurial attitudes and limited product markets. Since the claim omits these other important factors and inaccurately presents the cited issues as the only reasons, the reference contradicts the claim.

i_1570,Contradiction,"Policy and Planning Conflicts: The four-step principle in Sweden's national transport policy emphasizes reducing the need for transport and using existing infrastructure efficiently before considering new constructions. However, many measures in steps 1 and 3 fall outside the financial mandate of the Swedish Transport Administration (STA), limiting their implementation .","Research on sustainability and transport has paid increasing attention to how the purpose of the transport system is framed, often arguing that there is a need to shift the focus of transport planning and policy from the physical infrastructure to mobility and accessibility. Sweden's national transport policy also has elements of this shift, most noticeable in the so-called four step principle, where the possibility to affect the need for transport and choice of transport mode (step 1) and the possibility to use existing infrastructure more efficiently (step 2) should be considered before large reconstructions (step 3) or new infrastructure (step 4) is chosen as the solution to transport related problems. The aim of this article is to study whether the practical implications of Swedish national transport policy are consistent with the ambitions expressed in the four step principle, with particular focus on the Swedish Transport Administration's (STA) mandate to finance different measures. Based on an analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews the main finding of the analysis is that many step 1 and 2 measures do not fall within the financial mandate of the STA. The implementation of the four step principle therefore depends on the commitment among other actors than the STA to implement step 1 and 2 measures. Furthermore, it is concluded that the limits to the STA mandate has consequences for the ability of the STA to engage in collaboration with the actors on which it depends, and that strengthening the STA's mandate to finance a desired function rather than physical infrastructure is likely to increase commitment among other stakeholders to work with these measures. Such a step would imply a different regulatory framework than the current, more in line with ""the sustainable mobility paradigm"" (Banister 2008) and could contribute to a good accessibility to different amenities at the same time as negative environmental impacts are reduced.",Numeric error,"justification: The claim states that many measures in steps 1 and 3 fall outside the STA's financial mandate, while the reference clearly indicates that it is step 1 and step 2 measures that do not fall within the mandate. This discrepancy regarding which steps are affected means that the claim and the reference conflict with one another.

i_2353,Entailment,Environmental Monitoring: Implement routine environmental monitoring to detect and address potential sources of contamination in the culture collection environment .,"Compounding pharmacies and contract testing laboratories can readily utilize critical information that microbial identification methods provide. Rapidly identifying the genus and species of environmental isolates and sample contaminates provides pharmacies and laboratories the opportunity to determine the possible source and implement corrective actions to improve compounding and testing processes. The microbial identification data collected from a compounding environment is critical. It is important to have accurate and specific microbial information to guide environmental collection practices, validation studies, and troubleshooting initiatives. The different technologies available provide varying levels of identification. They range from phenotypic assays to more accurate molecular-based techniques, including macromolecular methods and whole genome sequencing. Selecting the appropriate identification methodology requires evaluating multiple factors including the level of information required (genus only, genus and species, etc.) and the pharmacy's tolerance for unidentified or incorrectly identified isolates.
[4]: The present work focuses on assessing bacterial profiles of microbiota existing on technological equipment applied in food products manufacturing, objects located inside medical and preventive facilities, and water objects in recreation zones; another goal was to examine phenotypic properties of opportunistic pathogenic bacteria isolates as hazard identification factors within the framework of risk assessment concept. Our research objects were strains of Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas, Citrobacter and Serratia families that were detected and extracted due to hygienic monitoring activities performed in 2013-2017. Samples were taken via washing, direct inoculation, membrane filtration, and instrumental aspiration technique. Microbial status was analyzed with cultural and biochemical techniques on nutrient and differential-diagnostic media with subsequent confirmation with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Phenotypic peculiarities were examined in vitro with conventional biochemical and microbiological techniques in conformity with the requirement fixed in Good Laboratory Practice. We revealed peculiarities of microbial profiles belonging to opportunistic pathogenic microbiota on different objects in habitats. The greatest groups included staphylococci detected in the air inside medical organizations with 1-4 cleanness degree (44 %); Enterobacteriaceae family bacteria, in washes off objects located in manufacturing and medical and prevention facilities (64 % and 69 % accordingly); Pseudomonas family bacteria, in water objects (46 %). 60 (36 %) isolates out of 167 examined ones had modified morphological and tinctorial signs regarding those typical for a family. Most isolates had a set of modified or atypical metabolomic signs such as hemolytic and lecithinase activities, apparent persistent factors, and ability to create biofilms. Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria strains extracted from washes off objects located inside food products manufacturing and medical and preventive facilities were the most potentially aggressive. Isolates from the same families extracted from water objects in recreation zones and air inside medical and preventive facilities had less apparent phenotypic properties that characterized their pathogenic potential. Our experimental data provide useful materials for examining a phenomenon related to changes in phenotypic properties; they can be applied during revealing and drawing up a hazard profile and for minimizing uncertainty within the concept of microbiological risk analysis.",Entailment,"justification: The reference emphasizes the significance of acquiring microbial identification data from environmental isolates and contaminants. It explains how quickly and accurately identifying the microbes in a compounding environment aids in determining contamination sources and in implementing corrective actions. Although the reference does not explicitly use the phrase “routine environmental monitoring,” its description of using microbial identification to guide practices and corrective actions aligns with the idea of routinely monitoring the environment (a culture collection environment in this case) to detect and address contamination sources.

These systems can be adapted for other industries, like unconventional petroleum projects .","A number of environmental and sustainability rating systems have been developed and used around the world. This trend has been most notable in the building industry, where evolution of construction practices and concerns about environmental impact have led to the development of different environmental and sustainability assessment approaches, strategies, models, appraisals, and methodologies. The implementation of green technology and practices has brought economic, social, and environmental benefits with respect to improving sustainable development performance with an accompanying certification process. The framework for developing rating systems for building systems can be extended and applied in other industrial contexts. As global demand for energy continues to rise, unconventional petroleum extraction and production of petroleum substitutes are both becoming more necessary. Development and operation of unconventional oil projects can have considerable social, economic, and environmental impacts. For example, one the largest unconventional oil deposits in the world is the Athabasca oil sands in northern Canada. Government policy makers, industrial developers, and other stakeholders generally work together to develop oil sands projects in an environmentally responsible manner; however, the projects lack of an effective sustainable development measurement tool. The WA-PA-SU project sustainability rating system is a proposed framework for measuring - in a consistent manner - the sustainability of development of unconventional petroleum projects in oil sands and heavy oil. The intent of the rating system is to have a tool that can be used by companies, stakeholders, and policy makers to measure and understand the range of impacts that projects may have over time. This assessment framework includes - but is not limited to - regulatory requirements, as well as approaches for measuring sustainability on social, economic, and environmental grounds. This paper presents a brief history of oil sands development, and the structure of the rating system.

The concept of zero-trust is enjoying increasing attention in both research and practice due to its promise to fulfil complex new network security requirements. Despite zero-trust's advantages over traditional solutions, it has not yet succeeded in replacing existing approaches. Uncertainty remains regarding the concept's distinct benefits and drawbacks for organisations and individuals, which hinders a holistic understanding of zero-trust and wide-spread adoption. Research can make valuable contributions to the field by systematically providing new insights into zero-trust. To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies.

i_676,Contradiction,"Research into new materials, such as lithium iron phosphate, aims to improve energy density and safety further .","Conspectus The commercial introduction of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery nearly 25 years ago marked a technological turning point. Portable electronics, dependent on energy storage devices, have permeated our world and profoundly affected our daily lives in a way that cannot be understated. Now, at a time when societies and governments alike are acutely aware of the need for advanced energy solutions, the Li-ion battery may again change the way we do business. With roughly two-thirds of daily oil consumption in the United States allotted for transportation, the possibility of efficient and affordable electric vehicles suggests a way to substantially alleviate the Country's dependence on oil and mitigate the rise of greenhouse gases. Although commercialized Li-ion batteries do not currently meet the stringent demands of a would-be, economically competitive, electrified vehicle fleet, significant efforts are being focused on promising new materials for the next generation of Li-ion batteries.The leading class of materials most suitable for the challenge is the Li- and manganese-rich class of oxides. Denoted as LMR-NMC (Li-manganese-rich, nickel, manganese, cobalt), these materials could significantly improve energy densities, cost, and safety, relative to state-of-the-art Ni- and Co-rich Li-ion cells, if successfully developed.1 The success or failure of such a development relies heavily on understanding two defining characteristics of LMR-NMC cathodes. The first is a mechanism whereby the average voltage of cells continuously decreases with each successive charge and discharge cycle. This phenomenon, known as voltage fade, decreases the energy output of cells to unacceptable levels too early in cycling. The second characteristic is a pronounced hysteresis, or voltage difference, between charge and discharge cycles. The hysteresis represents not only an energy inefficiency (i.e., energy in vs energy out) but may also complicate the state of charge/depth of discharge management of larger systems, especially when accompanied by voltage fade.In 2012, the United States Department of Energy's Office of Vehicle Technologies, well aware of the inherent potential of LMR-NMC materials for improving the energy density of automotive energy storage systems, tasked a team of scientists across the National Laboratory Complex to investigate the phenomenon of voltage fade. Unique studies using synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS) and high-resolution diffraction (HR-XRD) were coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), neutron diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and detailed electrochemical analyses. These studies demonstrated for the first time the atomic-scale, structure-property relationships that exist between nanoscale inhomogeneities and defects, and the macroscale, electrochemical performance of these layered oxides. These inhomogeneities and defects have been directly correlated with voltage fade and hysteresis, and a model describing these mechanisms has been proposed. This Account gives a brief summary of the findings of this recently concluded, approximately three-year investigation. The interested reader is directed to the extensive body of work cited in the given references for a more comprehensive review of the subject.",Entity error,"justification: The claim mentions research into new materials such as lithium iron phosphate to improve energy density and safety.

However, aquaculture is relatively new in the Pacific and such potential is hampered by a lack of aquaculture knowledge and practice within local cultures. A participatory action research approach was used to conduct on-farm trials with farmers in Solomon Islands to develop relevant and improved ways of farming and maximising productivity of the resident exotic tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. During the 34 month period when the research was undertaken improvements were evident, through increased farmer participation and improved knowledge of farmers on pond design and fish husbandry techniques. One of the contributing factors to improved farmer understanding was the production of knowledge products which were co-developed with and based on the farmers' local context. Productivity of a typical 20–38 m<sup>2</sup> pond ranged from 726 to 1819 kg ha<sup>− 1</sup> year<sup>− 1</sup>. Because 80% of this production was consumed by households, such ponds, producing easily harvestable small tilapia, have a role in supplementing household diets and contributing to improved nutrition at the subsistence level. While pond system productivity reached levels equivalent to low input tilapia ponds in other regions, the resident tilapia in Solomon Islands has limited opportunity for more than low level commercial enterprises.

This study aims to improve landslide susceptibility modeling by integrating advanced analytical techniques with deep learning, sensitivity analysis and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Our approach captures the complex interaction between natural terrain and human intervention and provides a novel framework for risk assessment and management. In this analysis, we performed a multicollinearity analysis to ensure the independence of predictor variables. We optimized deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hybrid of CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM), using Bayesian techniques. This optimization achieved a high degree of precision in parameter tuning. In the study, multicollinearity analysis showed that no parameter exceeded the multicollinearity threshold of over 9. When evaluating accuracy, the CNN-LSTM model was found to be the most effective with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96, while DNN and CNN also had high AUCs of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. Spatially, the CNN model identified 16.28% of the total area as highly susceptible, while the hybrid CNN-LSTM model delineated 13.39%. Sobol's sensitivity analysis emphasized critical factors such as slope, elevation and geology as well as the anthropogenic influence of distance to built-up (DTB). The SHAP analysis confirmed the importance of these factors. This integrated method offers an innovative way to understand the dynamics of landslides by combining natural and human factors and provides the basis for sustainable infrastructure planning in Nainital.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that AI-driven decision support systems used for disaster mitigation—in particular for earthquake and landslide risk assessments—utilize both geographical information systems (GIS) and deep learning models. In the reference, the first section describes an earthquake disaster decision support system based on GIS and AI, which covers the earthquake aspect. The second section details a landslide susceptibility study that specifically uses deep learning models (such as CNN, DNN, and CNN-LSTM) along with advanced analytical techniques; this supports the landslide risk assessment aspect. Together, both sections confirm that the systems use the respective technologies mentioned in the claim.

However, the environmental challenges posed by the required investment in digital infrastructure are likely to outweigh the social benefits, making it questionable whether these initiatives can truly enhance sustainability .","The potential for environmental, social, and economic advances enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs) is tremendous: 'Smart Grid' systems hold promise for resource conservation and climate change mitigation; innovations in ICT help transition countries from industrial to knowledge economies, and bridging the digital divide in developing countries can help achieve Millennium Development Goals worldwide: ending poverty, enabling universal education, and creating global partnerships. However, the benefit possible from global use of ICTs cannot be realized without a corresponding build up of digital infrastructure. This projected increase in ICT products is of particular concern to environmental sustainability, in large part due to the global health, safety, and environmental effects of managing these products in the waste stream. The ability to quantify and manage environmental impacts of ICT products is complicated by continuous evolution of product form and function. The work described herein provides an assessment of how changing form factor and material composition in common consumer electronics - desktop and notebook computers - may influence the electronic waste stream in the U.S. Results indicate that dematerialization on a per product basis is largely offset by increasing volumes of the total waste stream. From an economic standpoint, end-of-life value will be enhanced by the increasing use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium but potentially impacted by decreasing precious metal content. This paper also suggests that common design for end-of-life heuristics may be less applicable to ICT products undergoing rapid technological progress, as exemplified by the changing form factor and lightweighting of the consumer notebook computer.",Entailment,"justification: The reference does acknowledge both the potential social benefits (e.g., bridging the digital divide, enabling universal education, and fostering global partnerships) and the environmental concerns linked to the necessary digital infrastructure. However, while the claim asserts that the environmental challenges are likely to outweigh the social benefits, the reference does not explicitly state that the environmental drawbacks surpass or nullify the social gains. Instead, the reference simply highlights that environmental issues are a significant concern without offering a definitive net impact comparison. Since the reference does not provide enough information to verify whether the environmental challenges indeed outweigh the social benefits, the claim is deemed unverifiable.

i_242,Unverifiable,"Mitigation Contributions: Moving Target Defense (MTD): Enhances network unpredictability, making it harder for attackers to target specific assets, and may also lead to improved overall network performance by reducing the frequency of successful attacks .","Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a framework for centralized command and control in cloud data centric environments. SDN separates data and control plane, which provides network administrator better visibility and policy enforcement capability compared to traditional networks. The SDN controller can assess reachability infor- mation of all the hosts in a network. There are many critical assets in a network which can be compromised by a malicious attacker through a multistage attack. Thus we make use of centralized controller to assess the security state of the entire network and pro-actively perform attack analysis and coun- termeasure selection. This approach is also known as Mov- ing Target Defense (MTD). We use the SDN controller to assess the attack scenarios through scalable Attack Graphs (AG) and select necessary countermeasures to perform net- work reconfiguration to counter network attacks. Moreover, our framework has a comprehensive con ict detection and resolution module that ensures that no two ow rules in a distributed SDN-based cloud environment have conflicts at any layer; thereby assuring consistent conflict-free policy implementation and preventing information leakage.
[8]: Servers in a network are typically assigned a static identity. Static assignment of identities is a cornerstone for adversaries in finding targets. Moving Target Defense (MTD) mutates the environment to increase unpredictability for an attacker. On another side, Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitate a global view of a network through a central control point. The potential of SDN can not only make network management flexible and convenient, but it can also assist MTD to enhance attack surface obfuscation. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of flooding-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our framework includes a lightweight SDN assisted MTD strategy for network reconnaissance protection and an efficient approach for tackling DoS attacks using Software Defined-Internet Exchange Point (SD-IXP). To assess the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and DoS mitigation scheme, we set two different experiments. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our framework. With the MTD strategy in place, at maximum, barely 16% reconnaissance attempts were successful while the DoS attacks were accurately detected with false alarm rate as low as 7.1%.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that Moving Target Defense (MTD) increases network unpredictability, making it harder for attackers to target specific assets, and that it may improve overall network performance by reducing the frequency of successful attacks. The reference explains how MTD, within an SDN framework, is employed to dynamically adjust the network (e.g., through reconfiguration and obfuscation of the attack surface) to mitigate attacks. It specifically mentions that MTD increases unpredictability by mutating the network environment and provides experimental evidence showing a significant reduction in the success of reconnaissance efforts (e.g., only 16% of attempts succeeding). While the reference does not explicitly state that overall network performance is improved, the reduction in successful attacks supports the notion that network disruption is decreased, which is consistent with the claim's implication.

i_870,Contradiction,"Machining Environment: Lubrication: Using cutting fluids (wet conditions) can significantly reduce burr size compared to dry conditions. However, mist lubrication can also be effective while being more environmentally friendly .","The burr formation mechanisms strongly depend on the machining methods as well as cutting conditions. Cutting fluids play significant roles in machining, including reduction of friction and temperature. Using a cutting fluid, however, degrades the quality of the environment and increases machining costs. In the present work, initially the effects of cutting fluid application (dry, mist and flood) and their interaction with cutting parameters on the burr size during drilling of 6061-T6 aluminum alloys were investigated using multi-level full factorial design. Second-order non-linear mathematical models were developed to predict burr height for various lubrication modes. The accuracy of the regression equations formulated to predict burr height when using different lubrication modes has been verified through carrying out random experiments in the range of variation of these variables. A procedure was developed to minimize burr size for drilling holes by presenting the optimal levels of process parameters. Taguchi optimization method based on L9 orthogonal array design of experiment was then used which has shown very accurate process parameters selection that leads to minimum burr height. According to experimental study, it was observed that dry and mist drilling can produce parts with quality comparable with those obtained in wet drilling when using the optimal cutting conditions. In addition, increase in cutting speed and feed rate exhibits a decrease in burr size. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.
[7]: Drilling a hole usually leaves behind a undesirable burr at the exit work surface. Application of the method suggested by Taguchi is made in this work to minimize drilling burr of an aluminium alloy using HSS drill within the domain of experiments considered. Parameters used are cutting velocity, feed and machining environment. The effect of process variables on burr height is explored, and the optimum condition for minimizing burr height using a back-up support is determined by the analysis. Experimental runs were chosen followingL<inf>27</inf> orthogonal array of Taguchi. Analysis of variance was undertaken to find out the influence of process parameters on the response noted. Predicted values are finally checked for accuracy through a confirmation test. It is found out that back-up support yields much better result than that of normal drilling process. Moderate cutting velocity, low feed and wet condition with water cooling were observed to minimize burr height using a back-up support. Machining environment is found to be the most significant parameter for reducing burr height.",Missing information,"justification: The claim asserts that using cutting fluids (wet conditions) significantly reduces burr size compared to dry conditions, while also stating that mist lubrication can be effective and more environmentally friendly. However, the reference indicates that under optimal cutting conditions, both dry and mist drilling produce burr sizes comparable to those achieved with wet drilling. This directly contradicts the claim’s suggestion of a significant benefit from wet conditions over dry. Therefore, the given reference contradicts the claim.

i_1147,Unverifiable,"Contact lenses, which provide refractive correction during the day, have been effective in reducing axial elongation and myopia progression .","Myopia is an important public health issue, and high myopia may lead to severe complications if left untreated. Orthokeratology lenses, worn overnight to reshape the cornea, are one of many recent modalities used to slow down the progression of myopia in children. This treatment has been proven successful, as evidenced by decreased spherical refractive error and axial length relative to the control at interval follow-up ranging from 6 months to 5 years. In this systematic review, the authors collected published controlled studies that analyzed the efficacy of orthokeratology lens wear and calculated longitudinal relative changes in axial length, revealing a weighted average of -45.1% change in axial length at the 2-year follow-up. The exact mechanism by which orthokeratology lenses reduce myopia progression is unknown, but research shows that the corneal reshaping decreases peripheral hyperopic defocus and therefore increases peripheral myopic defocus to likely reduce stimuli for axial elongation and subsequent development of myopia. Use of orthokeratology lenses is generally safe, but cases of associated infectious keratitis may have a higher incidence of virulent organisms such as Pseudomonas, Acanthamoeba, and antibacterial-resistant strains of Staphylococcus, partially due to the required overnight use of these lenses. Orthokeratology is regarded as one of the most effective non-pharmacologic measures to slow progression of myopia in children and, with regular follow-up to ensure safety, continues to be one of the most effective treatments for myopia management around the world.
[5]: Purpose: To review the published evidence to evaluate the ability of orthokeratology (Ortho-K) treatment to reduce myopic progression in children and adolescents compared with the use of spectacles or daytime contact lenses for standard refractive correction. Methods: Literature searches of the PubMed database, the Cochrane Library, and the databases of clinical trials were last conducted on August 21, 2018, with no date restrictions but limited to articles published in English. These searches yielded 162 citations, of which 13 were deemed clinically relevant for full-text review and inclusion in this assessment. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating to the selected studies. Results: The 13 articles selected for inclusion include 3 prospective, randomized clinical trials; 7 nonrandomized, prospective comparative studies; and 3 retrospective case series. One study provided level I evidence, 11 studies provided level II evidence, and 1 study provided level III evidence. Most studies were performed in populations of Asian ethnicity. Change in axial length was the primary outcome for 10 of 13 studies and change in refraction was the primary outcome for 3 of 13 studies. In these studies, Ortho-K typically reduced axial elongation by approximately 50% over a 2-year study period. This corresponds to average axial length change values of approximately 0.3 mm for Ortho-K patients compared with 0.6 mm for control patients, which corresponds to a typical difference in refraction of approximately 0.5 diopters (D). Younger age groups and individuals with larger than average pupil size may have a greater effect with Ortho-K. Rebound can occur after discontinuation or change to alternative refractive treatment. Conclusions: Orthokeratology may be effective in slowing myopic progression for children and adolescents, with a potentially greater effect when initiated at an early age (6–8 years). Safety remains a concern because of the risk of potentially blinding microbial keratitis from contact lens wear.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that contact lenses used during the day provide refractive correction and reduce axial elongation and myopia progression. However, the reference specifically discusses orthokeratology lenses, which are worn overnight to shape the cornea and thereby slow myopia progression. This difference in timing and lens type creates a discrepancy because the reference does not provide evidence that daytime contact lenses (as claimed) are effective in reducing axial elongation—it only shows that overnight-worn orthokeratology lenses are effective.

Many scores of surgical risk assessment have been proposed. The Charlson index and the CIRS-G are the most widely used. Because of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes related to age, new anesthesia techniques, such as target intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), which allow fine adjustment of anesthesia level according to the patient individual parameters (age, weight, height, sex) will be preferred.

Therefore, this experiment was carried out to investigate the effect of oral administration of increasing levels of QS extract (0, 30, 60 and 90. mg/kg dry matter intake (DMI) containing 6, 12 and 18. mg sapogenin) on feed digestibility, growth and meat composition of sheep. Twenty-four 5-6-month-old Barbarine lambs (initial live weight 18.6 ± 1.98. kg) were allotted to four equal groups, all of which received oaten hay ad libitum and 400. g concentrate per animal. Immediately after offering the morning meal 10. ml water solutions containing 30, 60 or 90. mg of QS/kg DMI were orally administrated. Feed intake and growth rates were measured for 57 days. Thereafter, lambs were allowed a 4-day acclimation to metabolic cages before starting a 5-day total collection period. QS had no effect on total dry matter and water intakes. Administration of 60 or 90. mg QS/kg DMI decreased NDF digestibility (P=0.011); however, it had no effect on crude protein digestibility, N retention, microbial N supply and ammonia concentration in the rumen fluid suggesting that QS did not improve, as expected, the efficiency of N utilisation although a linear reduction of protozoa count in the rumen fluid just before or 4. h after distribution of the morning feed (P=0.0027 and P=0.0011, respectively) was observed. Blood profiles indicated that QS had no effect (P>0.05) on plasma urea and cholesterol concentrations. However, lambs receiving QS exhibited lower (P<0.05) concentration of plasma glucose than control lambs (without QS). No effect on both feed intake and efficiency of N utilisation may explain the absence of response of QS extracts (30-90. mg/kg DMI) on animal growth. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids in lamb meat were not influenced by the QS supplementation (P>0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the ratio PUFA to SFA tended to be higher in meat from the QS-supplemented animals than from control lambs. It is concluded that the administration of 30, 60 or 90. mg QS/kg DMI had a defaunation effect but failed to improve feed digestibility, growth performance and meat quality of Barbarine lambs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. [13] Utilization of low-input feed resources rich in plant bioactive compounds is a promising strategy for modulating the fatty acid profile in ruminant products. They manipulate microbes involved in rumen biohydrogenation and increase the accumulation of desirable fatty acids at the tissue level. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess the effect of dietary supplementation of aniseed straw and eucalyptus leaves on growth performance, carcass traits and fatty acid profile of finisher lambs. Thirty-six Malpura hogget were divided into three treatment groups of 12 each, reared individually in pen (1.6 m × 1.1 m) and fed ad libitum complete feed blocks made up of 55 parts concentrate, 5 parts molasses and 40 parts roughage. Roughage in control (Con) was 20 parts each of ardu (Ailanthus excelsa) leaves and oat (Avena sativa) straw. In test diets, that is, Con-as and Con-el, 10% aniseed (Pimpinella anisum) straw and Eucalyptus rudis leaves, respectively, were added by replacing 5% each of oat straw and eucalyptus leaves. The lambs were weighed weekly; and at the end of 3 months of feeding trial, the lambs were slaughtered to study the carcass traits, composition and product evaluation. Average daily gain (ADG) and DM intake (DMI) was higher (P < 0.05) in Con-as compared to Con and Con-el, while ADG and feed conversion ratio decreased (P < 0.05) by 29.4% and 36.4%, respectively, in Con-el compared to Con. Carcass traits showed lower (P < 0.05) loin eye area and chilling loss in the Con-el group compared to the Con-as and Con, and the total carcass fat compared to Con-as. However, the keeping quality of meat improved in both Con-as and Con-el which was reflected by lower (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances values. Nuggets prepared from Con and Con-as meat had superior (P < 0.05) sensory attributes with an overall palatability. Fatty acid profile of longissimus thoracis muscle showed lower (P < 0.05) atherogenic and thrombogenic indices in Con-as and higher (P < 0.05) in Con-el group. Moreover, in Con-as group, the proportion of C16:0 was lower (P < 0.05) and C18:3n-3 was higher (P < 0.05), but no effect was observed on the amount of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; C18:2 c9t11). In case of adipose tissue, the content of CLA was higher (P < 0.05), and the ratio of n-6:n-3 was more nearer to desirable levels in Con-as group. Therefore, it can be concluded that aniseed straw is a promising feed supplement compared to eucalyptus leaves for improving meat quality and fatty acid profile in lambs.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that humic acids had no effect on the TVFA concentration in the rumen of sheep, but the reference provided does not mention humic acids or TVFA measurements.

This holistic approach is likely to guarantee the stability and growth of rural areas, although it may not be sufficient in all contexts .","The study of the relevance of the developing management trends in agriculture is rationalized by the fact that the agrarian sector is one of the most important and most dynamically developing sectors of the national economy. The aim of the study is to identify and systematize the methodological prerequisites for solving the problems of sustainable development of rural areas and their management. It was concluded that the sustainable development of rural areas contributed to the fulfillment of their economic functions, including the provision of food, agricultural raw stock, public goods, the production of goods and services, the preservation of the rural way of life and rural culture, enhanced reproduction of the population, development of public welfare and living standards, maintaining the ecological balance in the biosphere, as well as overcoming the interagency disunity between various levels of governance when deciding on the development of rural areas, which implied social partnership among the rural population, regions and the state. This made it possible to deepen the understanding of the nature of the emergence of agrarian crises and to justify the stability of the crisis trend as an initial prerequisite for the formation of a system for managing the development of both the entire economy and the agricultural sector, particularly in the context of analysis of the cyclical development of the economy and modern crisis theories.
[8]: The concept of sustainable development was widely adopted at the global level of development of society in the world.

In this research four interconnected methods on ensuring sustainable development of rural territories on the example of the Saratov region are developed. The differential and production method is based on growth of efficiency of agrarian production at use of intensive technologies, increase in a share of crops of perspective highly profitable cultures depending on climatic and economic features of various microzones of the region, on technological re-equipment of branches of crop production.

This indicates that the difficulties are not insurmountable, contradicting the claim.

i_1737,Contradiction,"The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI), which incorporates NDVI, shows negative correlations with soil moisture, suggesting that a decrease in soil moisture directly causes a decrease in NDVI, despite evidence that other factors may also influence NDVI values .","Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) is an important tool that reflects agriculture dry situation by inverting soil moisture. The changes of energy balance and vegetation index are two main factors to influence the precision of the TVDI. The MODIS (Moderate....) data products, as RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI(Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI(Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and Ts(Land Surface Temperatures), are applied and the DEM (ASTER-GDEM) data are used to correct the Ts data for the reduction of the topographic influences by topographic relief. The TVDI is then employed by comparison of different vegetation index, where the TVDI is more sensitive to soil moisture. Thus the dry situation in the study area is analyzed during the plant growth time and compared by the synchronous meteorology data. The results indicate that: (1) terrain correction can effectively prevent the decrease of TVDI value from a lower surface temperature for a higher pixel. The correlation between Ts-NDVI index and measured values on May is compared, R<sup>2</sup> will increase from 0.4634 to 0.5859 by terrain correction. It shows that the terrain corrected TVDI can improve effectively the estimation of soil moisture. (2) By comparing the correlation between Ts -NDVI, T<inf>s</inf> -EVI, T<inf>s</inf> -RVI, T<inf>s</inf> -MSAVI and soil moisture, all the TVDIs present the negative correlations with soil moisture. The best correlations between the soil moisture and TVDIs can be always found, such as T<inf>s</inf> -MSAVI in June, July and September 2005, T<inf>s</inf> -EVI in May, and T<inf>s</inf> -NDVI in August. Thus a TVDI feature space for different periods by these vegetation indexes are built for inversion of drought conditions. By comparison with agricultural meteorology, the results are acceptable. (3) Large area of the study area was humid from May to September 2005, drought occurred in the West on August, and humid was located in East on June. Therefore, compared with the measured data, the terrain corrected TVDI model is robust to eliminate the terrain and land cover influences to land surface temperature for inversion of soil moisture in the study area. And it is faithful to predict the agricultural drought condition in the study area during 2005 crop growth season.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference explains that TVDI, constructed using NDVI among other vegetation indices, exhibits a negative correlation with soil moisture, meaning that as soil moisture decreases, the TVDI tends to increase (or vice versa). It does not, however, state that a decrease in soil moisture directly causes NDVI to decrease. The claim’s phrasing implies a direct cause‐effect relationship between soil moisture reduction and NDVI decrease, which is an interpretation that goes beyond the correlation described in the reference. Thus, the claim adds a causality that is not supported (and is potentially contradicted) by the reference.

The stakeholder theory was used to examine how stakeholders' expectations affected environmental CSR, green innovation activities and how corporate innovation initiatives affected corporate image and corporate social performance. Corporate environmental practices refer to the entire process of adopting technologies and product designs for protecting and sustaining natural resources. Selected companies in Ghana were used for this study. The study employed a cross-sectional quantitative approach where data from employees were collected across six months. This study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the effects of environmental CSR on social performance through mediators: green innovation and corporate image. The empirical findings demonstrate that corporate environmental CSR practices have an impact on the development of green innovations that promote companies' social performance. Additionally, evidence from the findings supports that corporate image influences companies' social performance in Ghana. Furthermore, the findings from the study demonstrate that corporate environmental CSR enhances corporate social performance through green innovation and corporate image. The study recommends green innovation adoption to improve CSR practices, corporate image and corporate social performance.
[11]: Organizations increasingly recognize that environmental sustainability is an urgent problem. Green information systems (Green IS) initiatives can assist organizations in reaching their environmental goals by providing the ability to reduce the environmental impacts of information technology (IT) manufacturing, operations and disposal; facilitate transparency and enhance the efficiency of organizational resources and business processes; and foster eco-products through technological innovation. However, the nature and type of benefits such initiatives can accrue remain poorly understood, and accordingly, IT executives struggle to integrate environmental aspects in the corporate strategy and to launch Green IS initiatives. This paper clarifies the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability to Green IT and Green IS actions undertaken, and the organizational benefits that accrue from these actions. Using data from a global survey of 118 senior-level IT executives, we find that Green IS strategies mediate the relationship between environmental orientation and the implementation of Green IT practices and Green IS practices, which in turn lead to organizational benefits in the form of cost reductions, corporate reputation enhancement and Green innovation capabilities. Our findings have implications for the potential of IS to enable organizations' environmental sustainability and also for the differentiation of Green IT and Green IS practices.",Entailment,"justification: The claim discusses that simply developing eco-friendly products and improving operational efficiencies is unlikely to substantially improve corporate environmental performance without a comprehensive strategy. However, the reference focuses on how green innovation, driven by environmental CSR activities, influences corporate image and corporate social performance rather than directly addressing corporate environmental performance. Moreover, the reference does not explicitly state that incremental improvements (like developing eco-friendly products or enhancing operational efficiencies) are insufficient without a broader strategy. Therefore, there is insufficient information in the reference to directly verify or refute the claim.

s_516,Contradiction,"Customer and Manufacturer Acceptance: While ensuring the system is user-friendly is important, it is likely that widespread adoption will occur regardless of customer and manufacturer needs, as the ecological advantages will compel users to adapt to the system .","There is a simple concept that can significantly improve the environmental balance of battery electric vehicles and at the same time avoid the known disadvantages of these vehicles (short range, long charging times, high acquisition costs) without having to wait for further developed batteries or a higher proportion of green electricity. For this purpose, the vehicles are equipped with built-in batteries for short and medium distances and are therefore sufficient for the majority of daily journeys. For long-distance journeys, the driver borrows charged additional battery packs at swapping stations, which are automatically inserted into a standardised exchange slot within a few minutes. This paper focuses on the improvements in electric vehicles that can be achieved by combining built-in and exchangeable battery technique and also on the practical feasibility of the concept. It is shown that the battery capacity required for the entire vehicle fleet can be significantly reduced. The resulting ecological advantages on the one hand and grid-stabilising effects of a nationwide network of swapping stations on the other hand, support the transition to environmentally sustainable mobility. The characteristics of the concept presented are advantageous for its practical implementation. The acceptance by customers and manufacturers can thus be improved compared to previous battery swapping systems. The loan system for the exchange batteries may be designed conveniently and information security as well as data protection will be strictly complied.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference states that customer and manufacturer acceptance can be improved, which implies that these stakeholders’ needs and acceptance play a crucial role in the system’s implementation. This directly contradicts the claim’s suggestion that widespread adoption will occur regardless of customer and manufacturer needs due to the ecological advantages alone.

s_2211,Contradiction,"Positive Environmental Effects: Benefit to Marine Mammals and Seabirds: Offshore wind farms can enhance the habitats of marine mammals and seabirds. The construction and operation of these farms can lead to habitat improvement, reduced disturbance from noise, and decreased collision risks for birds .","Offshore wind power provides a valuable source of renewable energy that can help reduce carbon emissions. Technological advances are allowing higher capacity turbines to be installed and in deeper water, but there is still much that is unknown about the effects on the environment. Here we describe the lessons learned based on the recent literature and our experience with assessing impacts of offshore wind developments on marine mammals and seabirds, and make recommendations for future monitoring and assessment as interest in offshore wind energy grows around the world. The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. As the number and size of offshore wind developments increases, there will be a growing need to consider the population level consequences and cumulative impacts of these activities on marine species. Strategically targeted data collection and modeling aimed at answering questions for the consenting process will also allow regulators to make decisions based on the best available information, and achieve a balance between climate change targets and environmental legislation.
[3]: Wind energy is the fastest growing source of electricity in the U. S., and the energy potential,in the offshore environment is enormous. Environmental concerns have focused on,effects on birds, and in this paper we briefly review these effects in the context of methods for,assessing preconstruction risk and postconstruction impact. Federal statutes and legislation,including the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Energy Act of 2005, the Endangered,Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty will require that prospective developers conduct,some form of avian risk assessment prior to construction. Such preconstruction studies,should utilize a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design.,Offshore wind farms pose three primary threats to birds: barrier effects due to flight,avoidance, habitat loss (due to displacement), and fatalities resulting from collisions with,turbine blades. All have been demonstrated at land-based and coastal wind farms, and flight,avoidance and shifts in habitat use have been demonstrated in the offshore environment for a,limited number of species in Europe. The additive effect of these impacts to bird populations,may be trivial under current levels of development, but could become ecologically significant,as offshore installations increase as projected.,Interpreting the ecological significance of these effects requires additional research, especially,on understanding the importance of winter foraging habitat and population delineation,particularly for waterfowl. Such research and preconstruction studies will be expensive, and,we suggest public funding of these efforts and private-public partnerships as is currently,underway in some states.
[4]: Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006. All rights are reserved.",Missing information,"justification: The claim asserts that offshore wind farms enhance the habitats of marine mammals and seabirds by reducing noise disturbance and collision risks. However, the reference focuses on the environmental impacts of offshore wind development, emphasizing that there are still many unknowns and concerns, including potential disturbances, avoidance behaviors, habitat shifts, and collision risks (especially in reference [3], which details threats such as barrier effects, habitat loss, and collisions). Thus, rather than supporting the claim of habitat improvement and reduced risks, the reference highlights potential negative impacts on these species.

s_2110,Contradiction,"Natural Filtration Methods: Phyto-purification is ineffective as it fails to utilize the natural purifying properties of microalgae (microphytes) and aquatic plants (macrophytes). The microalgae-based process does not involve basins where microphytes and indigenous aerobic bacteria treat wastewater, and instead, these organisms are unable to consume organic, nitrogen, and phosphate pollutants. The macrophyte-based system lacks a functional filter system and does not support bacteria that convert organic matter into minerals, resulting in no oxygen supply to the bacteria .","Phyto-purification is a technique for wastewater treatment that harnesses the natural purifying properties of microalgae (microphytes) and aquatic plants (macrophytes). This process is commonly referred to as microphyte or aerated lagoons and macrophyte planted filters. Phytowastewater treatment is particularly recommended for isolated dwellings, such as those found in rural areas, small communities, and villages. The reason for this is that it is cheaper to install compared to connecting to a centralized sewage system in urban areas. In addition, the water can be reused for various purposes, such as watering gardens, without posing a risk to the surface or groundwater. Treated wastewater can also be safely discharged into natural bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, lagoons, and oceans. Phytodewatering, or wastewater treatment, is a technique based on the interaction between microphytes or aquatic plants, aerobic indigenous bacteria, and oxygen. Two main processes effectively reduce the pollutant load in wastewater and produce high-quality purified water. Microalgae-based phytodewatering, also known as lagoon treatment, involves a series of basins of varying dimensions and depths. In these basins, microphytes with indigenous aerobic bacteria act as the primary biological agents for bioremediation. The wastewater remains in the basins for an extended period, allowing the planktonic algae to thrive and consume the organic, nitrogen, and phosphate pollutants in the wastewater. The process of phytoepuration with macrophytes is usually divided into two stages. First, a vertical flow filter consists of gravel and aquatic plants such as Phragmites australis, followed by a second horizontal flow filter consisting of stones, gravel, pozzolana, and aquatic plants such as Juncus effuses, or ""Junco"". The roots of these plants provide a foundation for indigenous aerobic bacteria, which convert organic matter into minerals that can be absorbed by plants. In return, aquatic plants supply oxygen to the bacteria through their roots. Besides treating residential wastewater, this phytoprocess can also be used for greywater purification. The roles of microorganisms in wastewater treatment are twofold: algae's photosynthesis increases the water's oxygen content, influencing nutrient levels and reactions in the wastewater, while microorganisms consume mineral and organic pollutants present in the effluents and mineralize organic matter to make it accessible to plants. These complex bio-physical-chemical processes always occur within a close collaboration between plants and microorganisms and result in a good-treated wastewater quality suitable for discharge into the natural environment and agricultural reuse.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that phyto-purification is ineffective for several reasons: it does not utilize the natural purifying properties of microalgae and aquatic plants, the microalgae-based process lacks basins where these organisms can treat wastewater, and the macrophyte-based system is deficient because it lacks a functional filter system and does not support beneficial bacteria. In contrast, the reference clearly explains that phyto-purification does indeed harness the natural purifying properties of microalgae and aquatic plants, describing how microalgae-based methods involve a series of basins where microphytes and aerobic bacteria work to remove organic, nitrogen, and phosphate pollutants. It also details how the macrophyte-based system employs functional filters with gravel and plants that, along with the presence of indigenous aerobic bacteria, create a system in which bacteria convert organic matter into minerals with oxygen supplied by the plants’ roots. These details directly contradict the claim’s assertions.

s_1660,Entailment,"Challenges and Considerations: Environmental Concerns: The impact of fish farming on local ecosystems, particularly regarding sediment and nutrient pollution, is likely to cause significant harm to biodiversity and water quality if not managed properly, despite some evidence suggesting minimal effects in certain conditions .","Extensive fish production in earthen ponds is a common aquaculture practice, which requires draining of the ponds for fish harvesting. Despite their value for biodiversity and water retention, the impact of fish ponds on the receiving streams as regards fine sediment and nutrient pollution remains controversial. This holds particularly true for streams with endangered freshwater pearl mussels, requiring a highly permeable streambed with low fine sediment content for successful juvenile development. This study quantified the amount of fine sediment, suspended solids and nutrients delivered to pearl mussel streams in relation to the pond characteristics, distance to the receiving stream and applications of measures to prevent the input of fines. Comparing fine sediment deposition above and downstream of the pond inlets after 21 pond drainage operations, as well as continuous measurements of the turbidity for 12 operations revealed varying effects of pond fishing on the receiving streams. Average fine sediment deposition was increased by nearly six-fold compared to upstream and maximum turbidity values for single drainage operations exceeded 460 NTU. Draining between 1% and 92% of the water volume of individual ponds resulted in additional loading of 0.07–4.6 t suspended particles. Physical mitigation structures that prevent mobilized material from reaching the receiving stream significantly reduced the fine sediment input and deposition rates. Harvesting methods that do not require complete drainage of the pond reduced the turbidity by ten-fold. Without mitigation measures, the impact of pond drainage operations on the fine sediment deposition was comparable to high discharge events. No significant increase in nutrient concentration was observed during most drainage operations. These results reveal remarkable effects of pond drainage on the aquatic environment, as well as the possibility to minimize such impacts by switching to harvest methods that do not require complete pond drainage and installation of sedimentation structures.",Entailment,"justification: The claim asserts that the environmental impacts of fish farming—especially through sediment and nutrient pollution—are likely to cause significant harm to biodiversity and water quality if not properly managed, even though there is some evidence of minimal effects under certain conditions. The reference provides strong evidence that pond drainage practices in fish farming can lead to substantially increased fine sediment deposition and high turbidity (which can indeed threaten biodiversity, as in the case of the endangered pearl mussels). However, it also explicitly reports that during most drainage operations there was no significant increase in nutrient concentrations. This contradicts the claim's implication that nutrient pollution is a significant concern leading to harm if not managed. Because the reference confirms harm via sediment effects but does not support the nutrient pollution aspect, the overall information misaligns with the claim.

Bakso has been a very good low-cost protein source for all. By understanding the complexity of the colloidal structure of Bakso that is constructed by the protein matrix and swelling starch granule interactions, it is also made clear in this review that Bakso has the potential for being more than just a low-cost protein source meal enjoyed by all. The colloidal complexities of the food system in Bakso allows it to entrap fortifications of bioactive compounds, bringing Bakso to the realm of functional foods. Various simple attempts have been made to improve the eating quality of Bakso by simple substitution of the starch with other plant-sourced starches that have functional properties.

To compare the effects of low versus recommended levels of dairy intake on weight maintenance and body composition subsequent to weight loss. Design and Methods. Two site (University of Kansas-KU; University of Tennessee-UT), 9 month, randomized trial. Weight loss was baseline to 3 months, weight maintenance was 4 to 9 months. Participants were maintained randomly assigned to low dairy (< 1 dairy serving/d) or recommended dairy (> 3 servings/d) diets for the maintenance phase. Three hundred thirty eight men and women, age: 40.3 ± 7.0 years and BMI: 34.5 ± 3.1, were randomized; Change in weight and body composition (total fat, trunk fat) from 4 to 9 months were the primary outcomes. Blood chemistry, blood pressure, resting metabolism, and respiratory quotient were secondary outcomes. Energy intake, calcium intake, dairy intake, and physical activity were measured as process evaluation. Results. During weight maintenance, there were no overall significant differences for weight or body composition between the low and recommended dairy groups. A significant site interaction occurred with the low dairy group at KU maintaining weight and body composition and the low dairy group at UT increasing weight and body fat. The recommended dairy group exhibited reductions in plasma 1,25-(OH)<inf>2</inf>-D while no change was observed in the low dairy group. No other differences were found for blood chemistry, blood pressure or physical activity between low and recommended dairy groups. The recommended dairy group showed significantly greater energy intake and lower respiratory quotient compared to the low dairy group. Conclusion. Weight maintenance was similar for low and recommended dairy groups. The recommended dairy group exhibited evidence of greater fat oxidation and was able to consume greater energy without greater weight gain compared to the low dairy group.

It is sometimes associated with the concept of peptic disease, although it is not always like that. Peptic ulcers are mucosal lesions of varying depth. They can affect gastric or duodenal mucosa. One of the most common causes of gastritis and peptic disease in children is infection with Helicobacter pylori. The role of H. pylori in other entities different from peptic disease is sometimes controversial. Gastrointestinal bleeding can be upper bleeding (above the ligament of Treitz) or lower (distal to this structure). In upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the manifestation can be hematemesis or melena, while the lower can be revealed in rectal bleeding, hematochezia or melena. In this manuscript we review the most frequent causes of these affections.
[7]: Hematemesis and acute postsurgical upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage are common emergent on-call consultations for the interventional radiologist. Upper GI bleleding (UGIB) is a relatively frequent problem. The incidence and mortality vary among patient populations, but studies have shown an overall incidence ranging from 36-172 cases per 100,000 adults per year, with a mortality rate of 5%-14%. The incidence is significantly higher in men. Peptic ulcer disease is the predominant etiology, responsible for 28%-59% of UGIB. Other causes include varices, mucosal erosive disease, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and malignancy. After assessment of hemodynamic status and airway stability with resuscitative efforts as needed, initial consultation with gastroenterology for endoscopic evaluation and treatment is well regarded as the initial therapeutic strategy. Angiography with embolization and interventional techniques directed at managing variceal hemorrhage have emerged as very capable second-line strategies for patients who have failed endoscopic therapy. In certain circumstances, the interventional radiologist may be called upon as the first line, notably for patients who have had recent surgical intervention or who have extraluminal hemorrhage.

s_2109,Entailment,"Inferred Insights for Lebanon: Potential for High Variability: Similar to other regions, Lebanon's groundwater nitrate concentrations may exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to diverse land use and hydrological conditions .","Groundwater nitrate concentrations in the Permo-Triassic aquifer of the Eden Valley vary from less than 4 mg l<sup>-1</sup> to in excess of 100 mg l<sup>-1</sup> (as NO<inf>3</inf>). A significant number of boreholes exhibit rising trends in nitrate concentration that either approach or exceed the CEC Directive 80/778 Maximum Admissible Concentration (MAC) of 50 mg l<sup>-1</sup>. The main source of the nitrate is believed to be the nitrogen applied to grassland, both as slurry and as inorganic fertilizers. The variability in groundwater nitrate concentrations is thought to be due in part to land use, particularly where low-yielding boreholes derive their water from a limited/localized area, and in part due to the variability in the travel times for water and solutes to migrate from the soil to the water table and then to the borehole. This variability in travel times is a function of surficial geology, depth to water table, depth of borehole and superficial deposit thickness, amongst other factors. It is surprising, given the considerable storage within the saturated zone of the aquifer and the slow groundwater movement, that some relatively deep boreholes pump groundwater with nitrate concentrations in excess of 20 mgl<sup>-1</sup>. Simple numerical modelling suggests that the fraction of modern water pumped is sensitive to the presence of fissures close to the abstraction boreholes and the location of the boreholes relative to superficial deposits. For some scenarios, using realistic superficial deposit geometries and aquifer hydraulic parameters, the proportion of modern water (water that is derived from infiltration that reached the water table since pumping started) could exceed 40% within 15 years of pumping. © The Geological Society of London 2006.
[2]: Nitrate in groundwater from alluvial and weathered granitic aquifers was monitored for 1–1.5 years on a monthly basis in an agricultural area with a high density of livestock feedlots to identify the main factors that control temporal variations in nitrate concentration. The baseline-loading group had median NO<inf>3</inf>–N concentrations of 5–7 mg/L, with temporal variations of 5–34 % indicating less impact of nitrogen sources. This group was mainly located in paddy fields, areas that have limited rainfall recharge during summer monsoon. Upland wells and those near livestock facilities had median NO<inf>3</inf>–N concentrations of 11–41 mg/L with temporal variations of 10–87 %, which were designated as the elevated-loading group. Overall, nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased during dry/growing season of spring and fall due to the mixing of the groundwater in these areas with deeper groundwater because of heavy pumping, whereas nitrate concentrations increased during summer monsoon due to infiltration of the nitrate concentrated in the soil zone, and the level was maintained or rebounded during dry/fallow season. Multiple linear regression showed that nitrate was positively explained by SO<inf>4</inf>, Cl, and DO, and negatively explained by pH and HCO<inf>3</inf> indicating groundwater recharge and mixing of shallow and deep groundwater are important factors for nitrate contamination. These results show that nitrate concentrations in groundwater were controlled more by hydrologic processes than by biogeochemical processes, because most wells were considerably oxic. However, some of the wells were suboxic, and they exhibited increased Cl/NO<inf>3</inf> ratio and concentrations of HCO<inf>3</inf> and Mn(II) and decreased nitrate concentrations. Furthermore, NH<inf>3</inf>–N was detected up to 2.6 mg/L with a sharp decrease in nitrate concentrations in one well, suggesting that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and denitrification contributed to reduction in nitrate concentrations. This study revealed the effects of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes on temporal variations in nitrate concentrations in groundwater with high N loadings due to agricultural activity and a low potential for nitrate attenuation.
[5]: Intensive farming usually imply a degradation of groundwater resources worldwide. In particular, nitrate concentrations exceeding the 50 mg L<sup>−1</sup> limit established for drinking water pose the human health at risk. Therefore, assessing the impact of farming on groundwater, in terms of space and time, is of fundamental importance for policy decision makers and land managers. This study was aimed at assessing the nitrate source and fate in groundwater by combining hydrogeochemical and isotopic tools. The study area is located in the coastal plain of Arborea (Italy), a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) due to intensive farming and animal husbandry (28,000 bovine livestock units). This area represents Mediterranean environments where groundwater resources are of relevant importance. In order to assess the present level of groundwater contamination and evaluate temporal variations, 6 hydrogeochemical surveys were carried out bimonthly at 13 sampling sites located in an area of 6 km<sup>2</sup>. Additional samples were collected in specific surveys (82 water samples in total). The physical-chemical parameters, nitrogen species concentrations, major and minor components were determined, together with the boron, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur isotopic delta values. Results showed that groundwater samples were of meteoric origin, as indicated by the δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>H2O</inf> values. The groundwater showed near-neutral pH (6.8–7.9) and different values of redox potential (0.2 ÷ 0.5 V), dissolved oxygen (2 ÷ 6 mg L<sup>−1</sup>), electrical conductivity (0.8 ÷ 2.1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup>) and chemical composition (sodium-chloride ÷ calcium-bicarbonate). Nitrate was not homogeneously distributed in groundwater, being observed a large range of concentrations, from <1 up to 162 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The above differences reflected the variability of groundwater circulation at small scale, which in turn controlled the interaction of water with different sediments (sands and/or clays). The shallow wells (about 5 m depth), screened in groundwater interacting mainly with sands, showed marked variations under the monitoring period, with nitrate peaks reflecting high leaching of nitrate in correspondence of fertilization and irrigation periods. The deeper wells (15–37 m depth) showed high to moderate nitrate when screened in sandy aquifer, whereas they had very low nitrate and relatively high ammonium (up to 1.8 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) when clay layers were intercepted. Trends of δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>NO3</inf> values in the nitrate of shallow groundwater were related to the nitrate concentration observed over the monitored period. This dual isotope systematic showed a likely source of nitrate in groundwater from either manure or sewage. The δ<sup>11</sup>B signature coupled to δ<sup>15</sup>N values clearly identified the manure as the predominant source of nitrate in the shallow and deep groundwater at Arborea. Relative enrichments in heavy nitrogen coupled to high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater were mainly attributed to volatilization processes occurring during the storage of animal wastes prior to application on the soil. Mixing of groundwater with seawater was not recognized, whereas mixing between shallow and deep groundwater may have occurred locally. Natural attenuation of nitrate contamination was observed in the deep groundwater interacting with lagoon clays rich in organic matter. Heterotrophic denitrification processes were highlighted by relatively high δ<sup>15</sup>N, δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>NO3</inf>, δ<sup>34</sup>S and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>SO4</inf> values in association with low SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> and high HCO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>/SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2−</sup> molar ratios observed in the groundwater with low concentration of nitrate. Results of this study showed that site-specific investigations are required for designing the best practices aimed at preserving groundwater resources under Mediterranean conditions. The spreading of animal waste on soils affects groundwater systems and likely extends over long time, strongly depending on the time lag of nutrient transport from source areas to receptor wells. Therefore, adequate monitoring of groundwater quality is required in areas of intensive farming.
[7]: The chemistry of surface waters and groundwater draining agricultural catchments in the north-central and northwestern areas of Sri Lanka is described. Hydrochemical data from 296 water samples are used to evaluate water quality and to identify the processes that control nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the water. The results indicate that nutrient concentrations in the groundwaters are greater than those in the surface waters. Increased nutrient levels were observed in groundwater in a selected area in the fortnight following fertilizer application. Detailed geochemical investigations of selected groundwater samples reveal a gradual rise of nitrate-N and other solutes along the horizontal flow direction. Compared to the application rates of fertilizer in the area, the average nutrient concentrations in all waters are relatively low (1.5 mg/l nitrate and 0.5 mg/l phosphate) and stable. The results suggest that prevailing reducing conditions, iron-rich overburden soil cover and manmade canal networks control nutrient accumulation in the groundwater. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.
[12]: Nitrate is commonly used as an environmental indicator to trace the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater. Hence, a survey was made of the nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of a shallow aquifer in Kathmandu valley from 90 wells, including shallow tube wells, dug wells and stone spouts (locally called dhunge dharas). The aims of this study are to describe the current status and trends of the nitrate contamination in different sources of shallow goundwater systems and to provide a sound, scientific understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the nitrate contamination. The study indicates 16% of the sampled wells exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of 10 mg/L of nitrate-nitrogen; however, another 33% wells have impacted levels of nitrate, i.e. between 2 and 10 mg/L. Although, nitrate contamination is widespread in shallow groundwater systems of Kathmandu, its concentration depends on depth of water table, well types and land use. Copyright © 2009 IAHS Press.
[13]: An investigation was carried out to evaluate the geochemical processes regulating groundwater quality in a coastal region, Barka, Sultanate of Oman. The rapid urban developments in Barka cause depletion of groundwater quantity and deterioration of quality through excessive consumption and influx of pollutants from natural and anthropogenic activities. In this study, 111 groundwater samples were collected from 79 wells and analysed for pH, EC, DO, temperature, major ions, silica and nutrients. In Barka, water chemistry shows large variation in major ion concentrations and in electrical conductivity, and implies the influence of distinguished contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes. The groundwater chemistry in Barka is principally regulated by saline sources, reverse ion exchange, anthropogenic pollutants and mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions. Due to ubiquitous pollutants and processes, groundwater samples were classified into two groups based on electrical conductivity. In group1, water chemistry is greatly influenced by mineral dissolution/precipitation process and lateral recharge from upstream region (Jabal Al-Akdar and Nakhal mountains). In group 2, the water chemistry is affected by saline water intrusion, sea spray, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic pollutants. Besides, high nitrate concentrations, especially in group 2 samples, firm evidence for impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality, and nitrate can be originated by the effluents recharge from surface contamination sources. Ionic ratios such as SO<inf>4</inf>/Cl, alkalinity/Cl and total cation/Cl indicate that effluents recharged from septic tank, waste dumping sites and irrigation return flow induce dissolution of carbonate minerals, and enhances solute load in groundwater. The chemical constituents originating from saline water sources, reverse ion exchange and mineral dissolution are successfully differentiated using ionic delta, the difference between the actual concentration of each constituent and its theoretical concentration for a freshwater-seawater mix calculated from the chloride concentration of the sample, and proved that this approach is a promising tool to identify and differentiate the geochemical processes in coastal region. Hence, both regular geochemical methods and ionic delta ensured that groundwater quality in Barka is impaired by natural and human activities. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Entailment,"justification: The claim specifically addresses Lebanon’s groundwater nitrate variability, yet the reference excerpts detail nitrate concentration variability in various regions (e.g., Eden Valley, Italy, Sri Lanka, Kathmandu, Oman) without any mention of Lebanon or data directly applicable to that region.

Dietary patterns that reduce systemic inflammation, such as the Mediterranean diet, may help manage HS by lowering these markers .","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic disabling inflammatory disease of the follicular unit especially affecting apocrine gland-bearing skin areas. Little is known about systemic inflammatory complications of the disease. This study aimed to evaluate systemic inflammation in patients with HS by assessing serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and to identify potential risk factors for HS. Forty-four patients (M/F: 28/16) and 44 age- and sex-matched controls (M/F: 28/16) were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data, including smoking status, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), serum fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, SAA, and CRP levels, and ESR were assessed. Associations were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with HS showed significantly higher levels of pack-years of cigarette smoking, weight, BMI, and WC (P = 0.01, P < 0.001, P = 0.001) and elevated SAA and CRP levels and ESR (P = 0.008, P = 0.01 and P < 0.001). SAA and CRP levels and ESR were significantly associated with Hurley staging in patients with HS (P = 0.03, P = 0.003, P = 0.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that each unit increase in the ESR increased the HS risk by 1.08-fold (95% CI 1.02–1.13). HS is significantly associated with SAA, CRP, and ESR. Among these inflammatory parameters, ESR was an independent risk factor for HS. We recommend assessment of SAA, CRP, and ESR as biomarkers that reflect the disease severity in HS patients likely to develop complications.
[5]: Oxidative stress and inflammation are underlying factors in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. The postprandial state is characterized by low-grade oxidative and inflammatory responses, but the impact of different dietary patterns on these responses is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate postprandial oxidative and inflammatory responses to Mediterranean diet (MED) and Western diet (WD) meals. In a randomised crossover design, eleven healthy women, aged between 19-45 years with a body mass index of 20.0-24.9 kg/m2, consumed two different isocaloric meals: MED and WD. Blood samples were collected at fasting and 2, 3, 4 h postprandially and analyzed for oxidative [total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), total thiol, native thiol, malondialdehyde (MDA)] and inflammatory [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)] markers. MED meal intake resulted in increases in TAS (0.05±0.02 mmol/L; p=0.017), total thiol (23.00±7.69 μmol/L; p=0.013) and native thiol (12.82±4.94 μmol/L; p=0.027), while a decrease in MDA (-0.17±0.06 nmol/L; p=0.022) at 2 h. On the other hand, TAS reduced significantly overall (p=0.005) after WD meal intake. There was a significant increase after WD meal intake for IL-6 (1.39±0.49 pg/mL; p=0.017), IL-17 (4.30±1.50 pg/mL; p=0.017), IL-23 (8.38±3.51 pg/mL; p=0.038) at 4 h. However, serum hs-CRP, TNF-α and NF-κB levels were not changed significantly by meal intake. The results indicate that MED meal induces favorable effects on oxidative stress, while WD meal partially increases inflammation in daily life.",Entailment,"justification: The reference supports that CRP and SAA are elevated in HS patients and correlate with disease severity, but while it presents a study on the Mediterranean meal's effect on oxidative stress and some inflammatory markers, it does not provide clear evidence that the Mediterranean diet lowers CRP or SAA. Therefore, the claim about dietary patterns like the Mediterranean diet helping manage HS by lowering these inflammatory markers is not directly supported by the studies provided.

For example, using a 1470-nm diode laser with radial fibers, which can be enhanced with nanomaterials, significantly minimized adverse effects such as ecchymosis and bruising compared to bare fibers . This reduction in energy requirements can lead to fewer side effects and a more comfortable recovery for patients.","Background: Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is one of the most accepted treatment options for varicose veins. In previous studies conducted with a laser at 810 to 1320 nm, paresthesia, pain, and ecchymosis were common adverse effects. We hypothesized that a lower linear endovenous energy density (LEED), as used with 1470-nm diode laser fibers, would lead to a reduction in adverse events. Methods: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized observational cohort study of 312 consecutively treated lower limbs legs in 286 patients. Of these, a bare laser fiber (ELVeS-plus kit) was used to treat 168 legs in 150 patients (group 1), and a radial fiber (ELVeS-radial kit) was used in 144 legs in 136 patients (group 2). Laser treatment was performed in the great saphenous vein. Follow-up for all patients was 3 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of ecchymosis and bruising. This was correlated to the reduced LEED needed with the 1470-nm diode laser. Results: Laser fiber (odds ratio [OR], 22.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.2-24.5) and body mass index (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55) were identified as independent parameters for LEED. In group 2 compared with group 1, LEED in the great saphenous vein could be reduced from 79.4 ± 9.1 to 57.4 ± 10 J/cm (P < .0001). LEED was an independent parameter for skin bleeding (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.017-1.058). Ecchymosis and bruising were significantly less frequent in group 2 than in group 1 (P < .0001). The need for analgesia was low, with 103.08 ± 15.34 mg diclofenac-sodium in group 1 vs 82.08 ± 18.86 mg in group 2 (P < .04). Occlusion with elimination of reflux was achieved in 100% of group 1 and group 2 (P < 1). No recanalization occurred at follow-up.

A continuously metallurgic transition is very important for industrial applications, such as joint structures of spaceframe constructions in transport industry. In this project, 'compound casting' of light metals is investigated, aiming at weight-saving. The substrate used is a wrought aluminium alloy of type AA5xxx, containing magnesium as main alloying element. The melts are aluminium alloys, containing various alloying elements (Cu, Si, Zn), and magnesium. By replacing the natural oxygen layer with a zinc layer, the inherent wetting difficulties were avoided, and compounds with flawless interfaces were successfully produced (no contraction defects, cracks or oxides). Electron microscopy and EDX investigations as well as optical micrographs of the interfacial areas revealed their continuously metallic constitution.

This combination helps in reducing bone turnover and preventing further deterioration of bone microarchitecture .","Until recently, calcium supplementation with vitamin D and hormone replacement therapy were the mainstays of treating osteoporosis associated with the menopause. Hormone replacement therapy, indeed, was (and is) effective in preventing fracture, but is no longer to be considered to be a primary indication for this purpose.

[9]: Background: Osteoporotic patients with insufficient calcium intake and/or vitamin D insufficiency need adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation with their bisphosphonate treatment. However, consistent intake and, therefore, the effectiveness of calcium/vitamin D supplementation may be impaired by several factors in the individual patient: low prescription rate or lack of advice to purchase calcium/vitamin D; reduced compliance because of the complexity of the regimen; or incorrect intake. There is a need to provide patients with a better way of taking bisphosphonate treatment with their calcium/vitamin D supplementation. To this end, a fixed-combination pack to help patients take the combination of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D correctly and regularly has been developed. Objective: To evaluate patients' understanding of administration instructions, preferences and their perceptions of compliance, convenience and completeness of a fixed-combination pack of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D compared with those associated with separate packs. Methods: The new monthly fixed-combination pack of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D contains four weekly boxes. Each box contains a blister pack with one swallowable risedronate 35mg film-coated tablet and six sachets of calcium/vitamin D effervescent granules (calcium 1000mg and vitamin D3 [colecalciferol] 880 IU) for dissolution in water as an oral solution, together constituting 1 week of therapy, accompanied by a patient information leaflet. Two quantitative patient research survey studies were conducted using standard questionnaires in face-to-face interviews with 400 postmenopausal women in several French cities. Participants were given the combined pack and two separate packs (risedronate 35mg once weekly and calcium/vitamin D effervescent granules in sachets). In the first study, participants' understanding of administration instructions and preferences were evaluated. In the second study, participants' perception of compliance, convenience and completeness of the new combination pack of risedronate 35mg plus calcium/vitamin D compared with two separate packs were evaluated. Results: Participants asked about the combined pack answered a significantly higher proportion of questions about intake instructions correctly (80.3%) than participants asked about the two separate packs (70.7%) [p= 0.0004]. The combined pack was preferred by 72% of participants (p < 0.0001) for several reasons. Compared with separate packs, the combined pack was considered easier to use by 63% and easier to remember to use by 67% of participants. Participants believed that use of the combined pack would be more likely to help them take their bisphosphonate regularly (66%) and correctly (67%), and to take their calcium/vitamin D supplementation more regularly and correctly (68%), than use of separate packs. Seventy percent of participants believed that use of the combination pack would help them to not forget to take calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Conclusion: Use of the fixed-combination pack of risedronate 35 mg plus calcium/vitamin D once weekly could increase the likelihood that postmenopausal osteoporotic patients will receive a complete bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D therapy course and is likely to enhance correct intake of combination therapy. Use of this fixed-combination product will provide patients with a tool for improving adherence to recommended osteoporosis therapy and optimize the effectiveness of such treatment. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

[10]: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures associated with osteoporosis are the causes of increases in morbidity, disability and mortality, with important consequences for healthcare costs. Hence, osteoporosis therapy has been demonstrated as effective in lowering both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk and mortality. Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis can be divided into two categories: antiresorptive and anabolic agents. Antiresorptive drugs suppress bone resorption and are the most commonly used agents. Anabolic agents, on the other hand, stimulate bone formation and represent a more recent therapeutic approach to osteoporosis treatment. Moreover, among therapeutic interventions, an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is widely and strongly recommended, representing an essential part of any treatment regimen.

[2]: Sea urchins play a crucial role in the health and dynamics of reef ecosystems. Diadema mexicanum is a dominant grazer and erosive agent of the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific. Its reported distribution extends from the middle of the Gulf of California (26° N) to northern Peru (6°23′ S), including oceanic islands. Here, we report the occurrence of Diadema mexicanum in Isla San Jorge (31°0′38.53″ N, 113°14′34.84″ W), the northernmost island in the Gulf of California, which extends its range an additional 600 km northward. Sea urchins, ranging in test size from 4.5 to 12.4 cm, were present at 2–6 m in October 2015. This test size was one of the largest reported for this species in the eastern tropical Pacific. Spine length in sea urchins in the upper gulf ranged from 3.3 to 15.6 cm. Variation in body size of sea urchin may reflect variation in more structurally complex reefs from isolated islands that provide shelter from predation. The reef structure of Isla San Jorge is formed by high coral cover of the scleractinian coral Porites panamensis, with an average colony height of 26.27 cm (standard error, SE ±1.58, n = 60), similar to coral reef communities of the southern Gulf of California. Although D. mexicanum is considered a great force of erosion to the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific, no evidence of erosion was observed at Isla San Jorge, indicating a balanced dynamic between herbivores, macroalgae, and corals.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that sea urchins are detrimental to coral reef ecosystems by fostering microalgae overpopulation that smothers corals, implying a harmful role. In contrast, the reference clearly describes sea urchins as key species that control microalgal populations and help maintain the balance in reef ecosystems, suggesting a beneficial or neutral role. This direct conflict in the portrayal of the sea urchins' ecological impact results in a contradiction.

A concept that minimizes the environmental impact of the products created, through such choice of components and design that will allow them to be reused. Speaking of circular economy, it is impossible not to mention the role of alternative fuels. According to the EN-15359: 2005 standard - Solid recovered fuels. Specification and classes, alternative fuels are flammable wastes, defragmented, homogeneous mixtures, produced by mixing non-hazardous waste, with or without solid fuel, liquid fuel or biomass, and which, as a result of thermal transformation, do not cause emissions to exceed the limits set out in Ordinance of the Minister of the Environment on the standards of emission from the installations dealing with the process of co-incineration of waste. [3] Development of the alternative fuels market, regardless of technology, should be seen as desirable. The preparation of individual technologies for entering the fuel market is, however, most varied. In addition, a series of studies need be conducted to answer questions on the suitability and potential for using alternative fuels as a source of energy. The article presents the issues of the circular economy package and alternative fuels.
[16]: The Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 proposed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in which the SDG 11 promotes inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements; SDG 7 encourages efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all and SDG 12 ensures sustainable consumption and production patterns. For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them. A matrix has been developed between the ReSOLVE framework and the opportunities of CE in cities. The SCM has increased the pace of transition, yet the recommendations are given to implement the CE principles efficiently.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly discusses aspects of the circular economy that align with the claim. It mentions the promotion and development of alternative fuels as part of the circular economy concept.

The objective of this study is to determine the antibiotic resistance rates against first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections in elderly patients at our hospital, and use the results as guidance for empirical antibiotic therapy. Methods: In this study, data on all elderly patients aged 65 and older who were followed and treated in our hospital between March 2010 and March 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: 406 microorganisms were isolated from the urine cultures of 401 patients included in the study, because 5 (1.2%) patients harbored two microorganisms. Of the 406 microorganisms, 320 (78.8%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 72 (17.7%) were Gram-positive cocci and 14 (3.5%) were Candida spp. Escherich-ia coli (n=262, 64.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=27, 6.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=17, 4.1%) were the most common among Gram-negatives, and Enterococcus faecalis (n=36, 8.9%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=25, 6.2%) were the most common among Gram-positives.

[5]: Objectives: Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections encountered in the Emergency Department (ED). Objectives of this study are to describe the urological pathogens associated with UTIs in the ED, report antibiotic susceptibilities, and assess empiric antibiotic treatment. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 154 patients with positive urine cultures from January to June 2016 were reviewed for inclusion in the study. Patients were excluded if less than 18 years of age, hospitalized, discharged from the ED without antibiotics or diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Patient demographics, uropathogens isolated, in-vitro susceptibility to commonly prescribed oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and antibiotics selected for treatment were recorded. Results: One hundred patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 106 bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Group B Streptococcus accounted for 62.5%, 8%, and 8% of pathogens, respectively. Overall susceptibilities were 88.1%, 87.9%, 85.4%, and 70.6% for nitrofurantoin, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to nitrofurantoin at 96.9% followed by cefazolin at 94%. Ciprofloxacin was the most prescribed antibiotic followed by cephalexin, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Conclusions: Based on bacterial susceptibility patterns, nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are reasonable first line agents in the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections identified in the emergency department. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was ciprofloxacin, highlighting the importance of implementing antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and designing specific tools and educational programs for the emergency department targeted at minimizing fluoroquinolone use.

Options for initial treatment of pyelonephritis or UTI requiring hospitalization include levofloxacin (LVF) or extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Globally, uropathogenic Escherichia coli resistance rates to fluoroquinolones have increased in recent years. Objective To compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving ceftriaxone (CTX) to those who received LVF empirically for the treatment of E. coli UTI. Setting 433-bed community hospital in Lexington, KY. Methods Retrospective, single center, cohort study of adults with a urine culture positive for E. coli who received either IV LVF or CTX empirically for the treatment of UTI. Main outcome measure The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes include time to susceptible therapy (TsT), hospital cost, and susceptibility to empiric therapy. Results There was no statistically significant difference in LOS or hospital cost. Subgroup analysis compared patients that received concordant CTX treatment and patients that received discordant LVF treatment. Patients that received concordant CTX treatment had a nonsignificant shorter median LOS (4.16 vs. 6.34 days).

For its management, a fine morphological study of the testis, both macroscopically and microscopically, and an accurate choice of surgical procedure are mandatory. The present review focuses its attention on the anatomic substrates of adolescent varicocele and its pathophysiologic modifications. The comprehensive assessment of all the reported alterations should be considered by the clinician before deciding the type of treatment and the timing. © 2013 Giuseppe Santoro and Carmelo Romeo.
[6]: Background: Varicocele is a common urologic anomaly in adolescent males; however, evidence-based treatment guidelines do not exist. Hydroceles are known to be a common complication after surgical therapy, with a wide variation in the reported incidence between 1 and 40%. Aim: This study aimed to introduce a standardized indication-to-treat protocol and prove its efficacy by analyzing the outcome of patients. Secondly, it aimed to better define postoperative hydroceles because the wide variation of reported incidence is attributed to a lack of definition. Methods: Our standardized treatment protocol included an initial assessment with clinical grading of varicoceles, ultrasound evaluation of testicular volume, and calculation of the atrophy index. Indications for surgical treatment were testicular volume asymmetry >20%, discomfort and pain, or bilateral varicocele. The Palomo procedure (laparoscopically since 2005) was the standard procedure. Postoperative hydroceles were graded according to clinical findings and symptoms: Grade I, sonographic chance finding without clinical correlate; Grade II, palpable but clinically insignificant; Grade III, symptomatic. All patients treated according to the defined protocol were prospectively monitored between January 2001 and December 2015. Results: A total of 129 patients with left varicocele were referred to our institution; 70 fulfilled the indication criteria for surgical treatment. Twenty-eight of these patients were treated for volume asymmetry, 26 of these showed catch-up growth. Forty-two patients were treated for discomfort and pain; the symptoms subsided in all of them. Postoperative hydroceles were detected in 36 patients (51%). In 29 patients this was a sonographic chance finding (Grade I). Three patients showed a palpable but clinically insignificant postoperative hydrocele (Grade II) and four patients (5.7%) showed symptomatic hydrocele (Grade III) where treatment was recommended. Discussion: The treatment protocol allowed judicious indication for surgery and postoperative outcomes similar to previous reports. The high rate of catch-up growth in operated cases represents a proxy for successful treatment in cases where more precise parameters, like semen quality or paternity rate, were not yet detectable. The introduced grading system for postoperative hydroceles provs to be a valid and appropriate instrument, and promises to be a standardized method for comparing outcomes in future studies. Conclusion: The indication-to-treat protocol proved to be easily applicable, highly efficient, and have outcomes comparable to international literature. The necessity for a standardized grading of postoperative hydroceles was underscored in the data.

s_1047,Contradiction,VEGF: Supports migration of tumor cells to metastatic sites and is associated with reduced progression-free survival and overall survival .,"Intraabdominal tumor dissemination is a major hallmark of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. The CXCR3 chemokine receptor supports migration of tumor cells to metastatic sites, but its role in ovarian cancer metastasis is largely unknown. Herein, we first screened two independent cohorts of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSCs, discovery set n = 60, validation set n = 117) and 102 metastatic lesions for CXCR3 expression. In primary tumors, CXCR3 was particularly overexpressed by tumor cells at the invasive front. In intraabdominal metastases, tumor cells revealed a strong CXCR3 expression regardless of its expression in the corresponding primary tumor, suggesting a selection of CXCR3- overexpressing cancer cells into peritoneal niches. In support of this, CXCR3 mediated the migration of tumor cell lines OVCAR3 and SKOV3 toward malignant ascites, which was inhibited by a monoclonal anti-CXCR3 antibody in vitro. These results were prospectively validated in ascites-derived tumor cells from EOC patients ex vivo (n = 9). Moreover, tumor cell-associated overexpression of CXCR3 in advanced ovarian cancer patients was associated with a reduced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), which remained independent of optimal debulking, age, FIGO stage and lymph node involvement (PFS: hazard ratio (HR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-3.45, P = 0.003; OS: HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.50-3.71, Po0.001).

s_2072,Contradiction,"Adaptation Strategies: Increased CO₂ Levels: Elevated atmospheric CO₂ levels do not enhance photosynthetic efficiency or water use efficiency in coffee plants, and instead exacerbate the negative impacts of climate change. These detrimental effects are consistent across genotypes and are well understood .","Coffee is one of the world's most traded agricultural products. Modeling studies have predicted that climate change will have a strong impact on the suitability of current cultivation areas, but these studies have not anticipated possible mitigating effects of the elevated atmospheric [CO<inf>2</inf>] because no information exists for the coffee plant. Potted plants from two genotypes of Coffea arabica and one of C. canephora were grown under controlled conditions of irradiance (800 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>), RH (75%) and 380 or 700 μL CO<inf>2</inf> L<sup>-1</sup> for 1 year, without water, nutrient or root development restrictions. In all genotypes, the high [CO <inf>2</inf>] treatment promoted opposite trends for stomatal density and size, which decreased and increased, respectively. Regardless of the genotype or the growth [CO<inf>2</inf>], the net rate of CO<inf>2</inf> assimilation increased (34-49%) when measured at 700 than at 380 μL CO<inf>2</inf> L<sup>-1</sup>. This result, together with the almost unchanged stomatal conductance, led to an instantaneous water use efficiency increase. The results also showed a reinforcement of photosynthetic (and respiratory) components, namely thylakoid electron transport and the activities of RuBisCo, ribulose 5-phosphate kinase, malate dehydrogenase and pyruvate kinase, what may have contributed to the enhancements in the maximum rates of electron transport, carboxylation and photosynthetic capacity under elevated [CO<inf>2</inf>], although these responses were genotype dependent. The photosystem II efficiency, energy driven to photochemical events, non-structural carbohydrates, photosynthetic pigment and membrane permeability did not respond to [CO<inf>2</inf>] supply. Some alterations in total fatty acid content and the unsaturation level of the chloroplast membranes were noted but, apparently, did not affect photosynthetic functioning. Despite some differences among the genotypes, no clear species-dependent responses to elevated [CO<inf>2</inf>] were observed. Overall, as no apparent sign of photosynthetic down-regulation was found, our data suggest that Coffea spp. plants may successfully cope with high [CO<inf>2</inf>] under the present experimental conditions. © 2013 Ramalho et al.
[9]: Increasing atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> concentrations ([CO<inf>2</inf>]) are unequivocal, widespread, and responsible for increased mean global temperatures and altered precipitation patterns. In this context, among the topics that need to be better understood are the changes in the water-related processes and gas exchange properties of plants grown under these conditions. Notably, the effects of climate change on coffee (Coffea spp.) production are particularly concerning given the importance of this commodity. Especially, it has been reported that coffee trees exhibit better photosynthetic efficiency when grown at higher [CO<inf>2</inf>] levels. In order to elucidate the mechanisms involved with this response, the seasonality of water-related processes, gas exchange, and carbohydrate metabolism were investigated using C. arabica var. Red Catuaí grown at ambient and high [CO<inf>2</inf>] under field conditions, at a free-air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (FACE) facility for coffee, in Brazil. The trees were evaluated fortnightly, from November to February (hot and rainy—summer) and from June to September (cold and dry—winter). It was found that C. arabica trees grown under high [CO<inf>2</inf>] conditions exhibited increased photosynthetic rates (averaging 121% higher in summer and 45% higher in winter) in both seasons, without displaying any significant changes in the seasonal photosynthesis pattern. Additionally, there was a tendency for the coffee trees grown at high [CO<inf>2</inf>] to exhibit increased levels of soluble carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids in the leaves. Our findings suggest that coffee trees adapt to increased [CO<inf>2</inf>] through increased photosynthetic rates, enhanced stomatal conductance regulation, and augmented carbohydrate and organic acid synthesis. It is plausible that these features could help mitigate the effects caused by climate change.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that elevated CO₂ does not enhance photosynthetic or water use efficiency in coffee plants and instead exacerbates the negative impacts of climate change, implying uniformly detrimental effects across genotypes. However, the reference provides findings that show an increase in photosynthetic rates (34–49% under controlled conditions and as high as 121% in field conditions under high CO₂) and an increase in instantaneous water use efficiency for coffee plants. In addition, the reference does not mention any negative or exacerbated effects on the plants due to elevated CO₂. Therefore, the reference contradicts the claim.

One study reported phosphorus removal efficiencies of 72.98% in an up-flow aerobic/anoxic sludge fixed film bioreactor .,"The performance of two bench scale activated sludge reactors with two feeding regimes, continuous fed (an up-flow aerobic/anoxic sludge fixed film (UAASFF) bioreactor) and batch fed (sequencing batch reactor (SBR)) with intermittent aeration, were evaluated for simultaneous nutrients (N, P) removal. Three significant variables (retention/reaction time, chemical oxygen demand (COD): N (nitrogen): P (phosphorus) ratio and aeration time) were selected for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing the process. At high retention time (≥6 h), two bioreactors showed comparable removal efficiencies, but at lower hydraulic retention time, the UAASFF bioreactor showed a better performance with higher nutrient removal efficiency than the SBR. The experimental results indicated that the total Kjeldahl nitrogen removal efficiency in the UAASFF increased from 70.84% to 79.2% when compared to SBR. It was also found that the COD removal efficiencies of both processes were over 87%, and total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal efficiencies were 79.2% and 72.98% in UAASFF, and 71.2% and 68.9% in SBR, respectively.",Entailment,"justification: The reference reports an experimental result showing that the UAASFF bioreactor achieved a phosphorus removal efficiency of 72.98%, which directly matches the study mentioned in the claim.

The phase of clay mining (65.8%) is significantly impacting on all the investigated impact categories followed by brick moulding (24.8%) and brick roasting (9.4%) phases, respectively. Hotspots were assessed to identify potential for resource efficiency and circular economy at ABC bricks, Zimbabwe. It can be concluded that ABC is severely polluting the air with emissions above the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) standards for SO<inf>2</inf>, CO, PM and NO<inf>x</inf> thus putting kiln workers at risk of respiratory diseases. The calculated Air Quality Index (AQI) ranks CO as the most affecting pollutant with an average score of ∼600. Clay production efficiency was also determined, and an analysis revealed that extrusion and clamping stage contributed highly to the clay losses during brick moulding. Therefore, focus must be placed on these process steps to reduce raw material losses. Furthermore, an environmental waste (fly ash) was used in different weight percentage ratios of 10%, 20% and 100% to substitute clay. The increase of the fly ash content in the brick making process proved to significantly reduce the environmental load among the selected impact categories. ABC uses clay as its main raw material hence the high demand for clay. Strategies should include accounting of used clay daily and raw materials substitution. If ABC uses fly ash from its brick kilns and from other thermal power plant boilers to mix with clay in brick production, then the quantity of clay demanded will be reduced. Using fly ash will reduce rate of clay extraction while at the same time solving the problem of fly ash disposal in Zimbabwe. This circular option will ultimately result in reduced pit expansion, hence reducing top-soil loss and environmental degradation. It should not be disregarded that top-soil loss in turn affects food security. By adopting appropriate technologies, implementing resource efficiency, and designing circular economy patterns, the brick manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe may not only reduce production waste but also comply with enforced environmental protection legislation.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that substituting clay with fly ash will completely eliminate environmental impacts, including both the demand for clay and fly ash disposal issues.

Methods: We designed and performed this study to determine whether exosomes attenuate the lesion size of SCI by ameliorating neuronal injury induced by a secondary inflammatory storm and promoting neurite outgrowth. We determined the absolute levels of all exosomal miRNAs and investigated the potential mechanisms of action of miR-199a-3p/145-5p in inducing neurite outgrowth in vivo and in vitro. Results: miR-199a-3p/145-5p, which are relatively highly expressed miRNAs in exosomes, promoted PC12 cell differentiation suppressed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro through modulation of the NGF/TrkA pathway. We also demonstrated that Cblb was a direct target of miR-199a-3p and that Cbl was a direct target of miR-145-5p. Cblb and Cbl gene knockdown resulted in significantly decreased TrkA ubiquitination levels, subsequently activating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Conversely, overexpression of Cblb and Cbl was associated with significantly increased TrkA ubiquitination level, subsequently inactivating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the direct interaction between TrkA and Cblb and TrkA and Cbl. In an in vivo experiment, exosomal miR-199a-3p/145-5p was found to upregulate TrkA expression at the lesion site and also promote locomotor function in SCI rats. Conclusions: In summary, our study showed that exosomes transferring miR-199a-3p/145-5p into neurons in SCI rats affected TrkA ubiquitination and promoted the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway, indicating that hUC-MSC-derived exosomes may be a promising treatment strategy for SCI.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes experiments where exosomes from hUC-MSCs containing miR‑199a‑3p/145‑5p modulate the NGF/TrkA pathway, promote neurite outgrowth (as shown by promoting PC12 cell differentiation despite LPS-induced suppression), and contribute to improved outcomes in SCI rats. It also mentions that these miRNAs affect TrkA ubiquitination which relates to downstream pathway activation. Although the reference does not use the exact phrase “reducing inflammation,” it indicates that the treatment ameliorated neuronal injury induced by a secondary inflammatory storm, which implies a reduction in inflammation. Thus, the core elements of the claim—exosomal miRNAs modulating the NGF/TrkA pathway, promoting neurite outgrowth, and mitigating inflammatory effects—are directly supported by the reference.

Causes: Effective interaction between the moving belt and stationary parts of the conveyor .,"The misalignment causes the greatest damage to the conveyor belt. As a result of the interaction of the moving belt with the stationary parts of the conveyor, the sides of the belt wear intensively. This results in reducing the life of the belt. The reasons for this phenomenon are well investigated, but the difficulty lies in the fact that they all act simultaneously. The belt misalignment prevention can be carried out in two ways: by minimizing the effect of causes and by aligning the belt. The construction of aligning devices and errors encountered in practice are considered in this paper. Self-aligning roller supports rotational in plan view are recommended as a means of combating the belt misalignment.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference explains that misalignment causes significant damage by increasing wear due to the interaction between the moving belt and the stationary parts, leading to a reduced lifespan. In contrast, the claim states that proper alignment (i.e., avoiding misalignment) enhances performance and increases lifespan, and it identifies the interaction between the moving belt and stationary parts as a cause of malfunction. Both the claim and the reference convey that maintaining proper alignment is essential to prevent damage, making the information consistent.

i_114,Entailment,"This approach is likely to completely transform user experience and ensure that all interactions are natural and effective, as it addresses every aspect of emotional intelligence in machines .","Artificial Intelligence is a general appellation employed to describe the principles and development of systems aimed at emulating human intelligence for performing tasks requiring cogent reasoning, visual perception, and decision making related to the environment. Emotional intelligence, the ability to comprehend, use, and regulate emotions is often reckoned as a critical component of human intelligence, and is useful for optimizing human-human interaction. A recent influx of proactive devices and environments has made human-machine interfaces ubiquitous. With the interaction of humans amongst themselves as the blueprint for interaction between humans and machines, there is a growing need to induce emotional intelligence in the latter to regulate the interaction and enhance user experience. Communication among humans is supplemented by their innate capacity to infer the emotional state of the interlocutor with affective signals manifested with physical correlates of emotion such as facial expressions (FEs), speech, and voice inflections. Rigorous experiments in face-to-face multimodal cognition suggested FEs to be more predominant as compared to other modalities in conveying the underlying emotional state. Therefore, conventional human-machine interfaces that ignore or marginalize the user's FEs fail to procure and access a relevant segment of information present in the conversation signals. This has necessitated a paradigm shift in human-machine interaction with incorporation of FEs as a communication channel. A proactive affect-sensitive interface, able to regulate human-machine interaction in accordance with affective state of the user, has multitudinous prospective applications in a wide array of domains. This has lent a powerful impetus to assessment of emotions by FEs, an integral component of non-verbal paralinguistic communication. Motivated with the need of inducing emotional intelligence in machines, several models for representing affective facial displays have been introduced in the past. This chapter presents a systematic overview of diverse characteristic patterns presented for reliable analysis of emotional facial displays. The manifestation of emotions via FEs entails a non-rigid motion of facial features that can be embodied by a dense optical flow field, which is the apparent image motion in a time-progressing visual. The dearth of a detailed corpora pertaining specifically to the theme of visual information-based recognition of facial expressions with optical flow has motivated us to articulate various studies concerning this subject. Lastly, this chapter delineates the multifaceted concomitant challenges, outlines the strengths and limitations of different methods for emotion recognition with analysis of facial patterns and cites fascinating real-world instances apposite to the discipline.",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses the need for integrating emotional intelligence into machines, highlighting its potential benefits such as enhancing human-machine interaction and leveraging facial expressions for better communication. However, the claim states that ""this approach is likely to completely transform user experience and ensure that all interactions are natural and effective,"" implying an absolute and comprehensive transformation. The reference does not directly assert such definitive outcomes, nor does it guarantee that every aspect of emotional intelligence is addressed or that all interactions will be transformed. Therefore, the reference provides relevant context but does not fully support the sweeping nature of the claim.

s_127,Entailment,"AI-driven recommendation systems can suggest relevant resources to users based on their search history and preferences, enhancing the user experience .","In recent years, deep learning has yielded success in many research fields including machine translation, natural language processing, computer vision, and social network filtering. The area of deep learning in the recommender system is flourishing. Previous research has relied on incorporating metadata information in various application domains using deep learning techniques to achieve better recommendation accuracy. The use of metadata is desirable to address the cold start problem and better learning the user-item interaction, which is not captured by the user-item rating matrix. Existing methods rely on fixed user-item latent representation and ignore the metadata information. It restricts the model performance to correctly identify actual latent vectors, which results in high rating prediction error. To tackle these problems, we propose a generalized recommendation model named Meta Embedding Deep Collaborative Filtering (MEDCF), which inputs user demographics and item genre as metadata features together with the rating matrix. The proposed framework primarily comprises of Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF) methods. GMF is applied to the rating matrix, whereas MLP is applied to metadata. Using NeuMF, the outputs for GMF and MLP are then concatenated and input to a neural network for rating prediction. To prove the effectiveness of proposed model, two metrics are used, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The MEDCF model is experimented on MovieLens and Amazon Movies datasets showing a significant improvement over the baseline methods.
[7]: Information extraction and user intention identification is a central topic in modern query understanding and recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose DeepProbe, a generic information-directed interaction framework which is built around an attention-based sequence to sequence (seq2seq) recurrent neural network. DeepProbe can rephrase, evaluate, and even actively ask questions, leveraging the generative ability and likelihood estimation made possible by seq2seq models. DeepProbe makes decisions based on a derived uncertainty (entropy) measure conditioned on user inputs, possibly with multiple rounds of interactions. Three applications, namely a rewritter, a relevance scorer and a chatbot for ad recommendation, were built around DeepProbe, with the first two serving as precursory building blocks for the third. We first use the seq2seq model in DeepProbe to rewrite a user query into one of standard query form, which is submitted to an ordinary recommendation system. Secondly, we evaluate DeepProbe's seq2seq model-based relevance scoring. Finally, we build a chatbot prototype capable of making active user interactions, which can ask questions that maximize information gain, allowing for a more efficient user intention idenfication process. We evaluate first two applications by 1) comparing with baselines by BLEU and AUC, and 2) human judge evaluation. Both demonstrate significant improvements compared with current state-of-the-art systems, proving their values as useful tools on their own, and at the same time laying a good foundation for the ongoing chatbot application.",Entailment,"justification: The claim generally states that AI-driven recommendation systems can suggest relevant resources based on user behaviors (like their search history and preferences) and improve the user experience. The references describe deep learning approaches in recommender systems—one involving a generalized recommendation model that integrates user ratings and metadata, and another involving DeepProbe that rewrites queries, scores relevance, and assists in user interaction. These references support the idea that AI techniques are being used to enhance recommendation accuracy and ultimately user experience. Although the reference does not use the exact phrase ""search history and preferences,"" the underlying approach (leveraging user-item interactions, metadata, and query understanding) aligns with the notion described in the claim.

To guide the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy, the haemoglobin concentration is the most used test in spite of its low accuracy, and serum ferritin is the most reliable test, although its cutoff point remains an issue. Methods/design: The aim of this protocol is to verify the accuracy of erythrocyte indices and serum ferritin (studied tests) for the diagnosis of functional iron-deficiency in pregnancy using the iron-therapy responsiveness as the gold-standard. This is an ongoing phase III accuracy study initiated in August 2011 and to be concluded in April 2013. The subjects are anemic pregnant women (haemoglobin concentration < 11.0 g/dL) attended at a low-risk prenatal care center in the Northeast of Brazil. The sample size (n 278) was calculated to estimate sensitivity of 90% and 80% of specificity with relative error of 10% and power of 95%.

Clean water is essential for drinking, agriculture, and industry, which are foundational to human health and economic activities .","Amazonian forest produces environmental services such as maintenance of biodiversity, water cycling and carbon stocks. These services have a much greater value to human society than do the timber, beef and other products that are obtained by destroying the forest. Yet institutional mechanisms are still lacking to transform the value of the standing forest into the foundation of an economy based on maintaining rather than destroying this ecosystem. Forest management for commodities such as timber and non-timber forest products faces severe limitations and inherent contradictions unless income is supplemented based on environmental services. Amazon forest is threatened by deforestation, logging, forest fires and climate change. Measures to avoid deforestation include repression through command and control, creation of protected areas, and reformulation of infrastructure decisions and development policies. An economy primarily based on the value of environmental services is essential for long-term maintenance of the forest. Much progress has been made in the decades since I first proposed such a transition, but many issues also remain unresolved. These include theoretical issues regarding accounting procedures, improved quantification of the services and of the benefits of different policy options, and effective uses of the funds generated in ways that maintain both the forest and the human population.
[4]: Tropical forests host a large population of biodiversity that play a crucial role in global climate regulation. Besides that, it represents a foundation for the provision of ecosystem services such as clean air and water, valuable timber and animal and plant resources with high commercial and cultural value. However, tropical forests are facing great pressure as a result of increasing human exploitation. If the world's tropical forests are destroyed, then many of the biodiversity species will be lost along with them. Not only that, but the local community also loses the natural system that performs valuable services which is important for the continuity of human's life. The balance of economic growth and conservation of biodiversity and its components including tropical forest must be achieved. Having said this, the ongoing action in conserving our valuable resources of tropical forest is important especially to support the well-being of the local community.

Growth of juvenile Haliotis midae was monitored on a commercial abalone farm over a period of 9 months in an experiment consisting of 9 treatments with 4 replicates (n = 250 individuals per replicate). The treatments were: fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima) blades (seaweed control); Abfeed® (formulated feed control); kelp + Abfeed® dried kelp pellets; dried kelp blades; dried kelp stipes; fresh kelp with the epiphyte Carpoblepharis flaccida; a mixed diet (Gracilaria gracilis, Ulva lactuca, and kelp) and a rotational diet (abalone were fed 1 of the 9 treatments for the first week and them kelp for the next 3 weeks). Results show that abalone grow well on all fresh seaweed combinations, but grow best on a mixed diet. The likely reason for the success of the mixed diet is that the red and green seaweed was farm grown, with an increased protein content. Dried kelp in any form produced poor growth. Abalone fed on the mixed diet grew at 0.066 mm day<sup>-1</sup> shell length and 0.074 g day<sup>-1</sup> body weight; this corresponds to 24.09 mm shell length and 27.01 g body weight increase per annum.

Changes in water chemistry, such as increased nutrient levels, can significantly impact chlorophyll a concentrations, as seen in studies of other environmental disturbances .","The frequency of harmful algal blooms caused by eutrophication is increasing globally, posing serious threats to human health and economic development. Reservoir bays, affected by water environment and local watershed landscape, are more prone to eutrophication and algal blooms. The chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration is an important indicator for the degree of eutrophication and algal bloom. Exploring the complex relationships between water environment and landscape background, and Chl a concentration in the reservoir bays are crucial for ensuring high-quality drinking water from reservoirs. In this study, we monitored Chl a concentrations of 66 bays in Danjiangkou Reservoir and the related water quality parameters (e.g., water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) in waterbodies of these reservoir bays in the storage and discharge periods from 2015 to 2018. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to quantify the relationship between water environmental factors and watershed landscapes, and Chl a concentrations in reservoir bays. The results showed that mean Chl a concentration was higher in storage period than that in discharge period. Two optimal PLS-SEMs explained 66.8% and 53.6% of Chl a concentration variation in the storage and discharge periods, respectively. The net effect of water chemistry on Chl a concentration was more pronounced during the discharge period (total effect = 0.61, 37% of the total effect on Chl a), while the net effect of land-use composition on Chl a concentration was more significant during the storage period (total effect = 0.57, 30% of the total effect on Chl a). The landscape pattern had significant indirect effects on Chl a concentration, especially during the discharge period (indirect effect = −0.31, 19% of the total effect on Chl a). Our results provide valuable information for managers to make rational decisions, thereby contributing to the prevention of eutrophication and algal blooms in reservoir bays.

i_1034,Unverifiable,"3. Anesthetic Technique: Combined Nerve Blocks: For certain surgeries, such as knee arthroplasty, combined nerve blocks may offer better outcomes by reducing intraoperative stress and preserving immune function .","BACKGROUND: Anesthesia, surgery, and other nociceptive stimuli affect stress and hemorheological indices, impact physiological function, decrease immune function, and thereby influence recovery of hip joint function in elderly patients who undergo total hip replacement. Previous anesthesia methods for hip replacement in elderly patients include general, lumbar puncture, or epidural anesthesia alone. A combined nerve block is more suitable for total hip replacement in the elderly because of the safety and reliability of the method. In this study, we hypothesized that a combined nerve block is superior to any previous anesthesia method alone for total hip replacement in the elderly. Specifically, we hypothesized that intraoperative stress, hemorheological indices, postoperative immune function, and incidence of postoperative complications would be more favorable using a combined nerve block compared with previous anesthesia methods. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a combined nerve block on intraoperative stress and postoperative immune function in elderly patients subjected to total hip replacement. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled, open-label trial, which will be performed at Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital, China. A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled to undergo total hip replacement will be randomly assigned to undergo a combined nerve block (involving lower lumbar plexus, sciatic nerve, and paraspinal nerve L<inf>1-2</inf>) (experimental group, n=60), or general anesthesia (control group, n=60). All patients will be followed up for 3 months. The primary outcome will be serum cortisol concentration during surgery, as a measure of intraoperative stress. Secondary outcomes include serum cortisol concentration prior to anesthesia, and prior to and immediately after surgery; blood glucose level prior to anesthesia, and prior to, during, and after surgery, used to evaluate stress during different times. In addition, immune function-related indices including absolute leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-8, and T-lymphocyte subset levels prior to anesthesia, immediately after surgery, 1, 3, 7 days, and 3 months after surgery, will be used to evaluate patients' immune function after surgery. Hemorheological indices including electrocardiogram, pulse, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, heart rate, blood gas analysis prior to anesthesia, and during and after surgery will be used to investigate changes in blood-related indices. Lastly, incidence of adverse events 1, 3, 7 days, and 3 months after surgery will be used to evaluate postoperative complications. This trial has been approved by Ethics Committee, Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital, China (approval number QHY1017D) and will be performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, formulated by the World Medical Association. DISCUSSION: This study will investigate the effects of a combined nerve block versus general anesthesia on intraoperative stress and postoperative immune function in elderly patients who undergo total hip replacement. This study will provide objective evidence for selection of anesthesia method for total hip replacement in the elderly, with the aim of reducing intraoperative risks and postoperative complications.

The present study aimed to compare the efficacy of oral and intravenous iron therapy in improving iron deficiency anemia in pregnancy and restoring iron stores, compare the obstetric outcome in the two groups and evaluate the safety of intravenous iron sucrose. Material and Methods: This was a prospective study, where 100 anemic antenatal women with hemoglobin 7-9 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume <85 fL and serum ferritin <15 ng/mL, were randomized into two groups. In group A (n = 50), the women received 200 mg tablets of ferrous sulphate, each containing 60 mg elemental iron, three times a day for 4 weeks. In group B (n = 50), iron sucrose was given in divided doses of 200 mg each on alternate days by slow intravenous infusion.

Unlike other benthic taxa, sea urchins do not show significant variation in diversity with these parameters, indicating a broad tolerance to different environmental conditions .","The aims of this study are to compare cross-shelf variation in diversity and community composition of four benthic taxa (sea urchins, sponges, corals and foraminifera) in the reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago, Indonesia, and relate this variation to cross-shelf environmental parameters, i.e. distance offshore, depth and exposure to oceanic currents. Rarefied species richness and Shannon's H′ varied unimodally with the distance offshore and depth for all taxa (except sea urchins) and were highest at intermediate distances offshore and depths. There was no significant association between evenness and distance offshore. Evenness did, however, vary with depth and exposure. Overall, models using distance offshore, depth and exposure explained most of the variation in sponge and coral diversity but substantially less variation in foraminifera diversity. Variation in composition depended on distance offshore, depth and exposure although the relative importance of these variables differed among taxa. Depth was the most important parameter for sponges, corals and foraminifera but not for sea urchins. Sponge and coral assemblages differed markedly from in-to-off-shore but there was relatively little variation in foraminifera assemblages with most foraminifera species having broad cross-shelf distributions. Foraminifera assemblages on the contrary differed markedly between exposed and sheltered reef environments; species in exposed reef environments, for example, consisted of species with distinct strategies for coping with the increased hydrodynamic energy. In summary, this study shows that benthic taxa in the Spermonde are distributed along continuous gradients (in-to-off-shore and shallow-to-deep) in addition to occupying discrete habitats related to reef exposure.
[4]: In order to preserve diversity it is essential to understand how assemblages change across space. Despite this fact, we still know very little about how marine diversity is spatially distributed, especially among lesser-studied invertebrate taxa. In the present study beta-diversity patterns of sea urchins, sponges, mushroom corals and larger foraminifera were assessed in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia). Using ordinations we showed that the inshore zone (<5 km offshore), midshore zone (5 < × < 30 km offshore) and distance offshore zone (<30 km offshore) all contained distinct assemblages of sponges and corals, while only foraminifera assemblages from the inshore (<5 km offshore) zone were distinct. There was a significant spatial pattern of community similarity for all taxa surveyed, but this pattern proved to be wholly related to environmental variables for sponges and foraminifera, and primarily for mushroom corals and sea urchins. The lack of a pure spatial component suggests that these taxa may not be dispersal limited within the spatial scales of this study (c. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>). The analyses of the corals and foraminifera were additionally tested at two spatial scales of sampling. Both taxa were primarily associated with local-scale environmental variables at the local scale and larger-scale variables at the larger scale. Mean inter-plot similarity was also higher and variation lower at the larger scale. The results suggest that substantial variation in similarity can be predicted using simple locally assessed environmental variables combined with remotely sensed parameters. © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that sea urchins in the Spermonde Archipelago exhibit clear spatial patterns whereby their distribution is influenced by environmental factors like distance offshore, depth, and ocean current exposure, yet unlike other benthic taxa, they do not show significant variation in diversity along these gradients (suggesting broad tolerance). The reference supports this in two parts. First, it explains that measures such as species richness and Shannon’s diversity showed unimodal variation with distance offshore and depth for all taxa except sea urchins, directly backing the claim that sea urchins lack significant diversity variation with these environmental parameters. Second, an additional excerpt notes that while all taxa display spatial patterns in community similarity, for sea urchins the pattern is “primarily” related to environmental variables. This implies that environmental factors still influence their distribution, consistent with the claim. Therefore, the reference directly supports the key points in the claim.

[8]: Background: According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is closely associated with climate change and, in particular, with global warming. In addition to melting of ice and snow, rising sea level, and flooding of coastal areas, global warming is leading to a tropicalization of temperate marine ecosystems. Moreover, the effects of air pollution on airway and lung diseases are well documented as reported by the World Allergy Organization. Methods: Scientific literature was searched for studies investigating the effect of the interaction between air pollution and climate change on allergic and respiratory diseases. Results: Since 1990s, a multitude of articles and reviews have been published on this topic, with many studies confirming that the warming of our planet is caused by the ""greenhouse effect"" as a result of increased emission of ""greenhouse"" gases. Air pollution is also closely linked to global warming: the emission of hydrocarbon combustion products leads to increased concentrations of biological allergens such as pollens, generating a mixture of these particles called particulate matter (PM). The concept is that global warming is linked to the emission of hydrocarbon combustion products, since both carbon dioxide and heat increase pollen emission into the atmosphere, and all these particles make up PM10. However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM affects human health is still limited. Therefore, several studies are trying to determine the causes of global warming. There is also evidence that increased concentrations of air pollutants and pollens can activate inflammatory mediators in the airways. Our Task Force has prepared a Decalogue of rules addressing public administrators, which aims to limit the amount of allergenic pollen in the air without sacrificing public green areas. Conclusions: Several studies underscore the significant risks of global warming on human health due to increasing levels of air pollution. The impact of climate change on respiratory diseases appears well documented. The last decades have seen a rise in the concentrations of pollens and pollutants in the air. This rise parallels the increase in the number of people presenting with allergic symptoms (e.g., allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma), who often require emergency medical care. Our hope is that scientists from different disciplines will work together with institutions, pharmaceutical companies and lay organizations to limit the adverse health effects of air pollution and global warming.",Entailment,"justification: While the references clearly support global warming's impact on human health—with survey data and studies linking it to air pollution and respiratory issues—they do not provide explicit information about effects on biodiversity or detailed disruptions to ecosystems (e.g., heat‐related illnesses, habitat loss for species, or food and water supply issues).

Alternatively, observational data may be collected without a clear specification that the data could also apply to the solution of other, unforeseen problems. In such cases data analytics are used to extract relationships from and detect structures in data sets. In accordance with the scientific method, the results obtained can then be used to formulate one or more hypotheses and associated models as solutions for such problems. This approach allows for ensuring the validity of the solutions obtained. The results thus obtained may lead to a deeper insight in such problems and can represent significant progress in scientific research. The increased interest in so-called Big Data resulted in a growing tendency to consider the structures detected by analysing large data sets as solutions in their own right. A notion is thus developing that the scientific method is becoming obsolete. In this paper it is argued that data, hypotheses and models are essential to gain deeper insights into the nature of the problems considered and to ensure that plausible solutions were found.

[6]: The paper describes a method for the reducing emission of low-frequency noise of modern automotive vehicles into the environment. The importance of reducing the external noise of modern mobile energy facilities made in Russia is substantiated. Standard methods for controlling external noise in technology are of low efficiency when low-frequency sound waves are reduced. In this case, it is in the low-frequency zone of the sound range that the main power of the noise emitted by the machinery lies. The most effective way to reduce such sound waves is to use active noise control systems. A design of a muffler using a similar system is presented. This muffler allowed one to reduce the emission of increased noise levels into the environment by 7-11 dB and to increase acoustic comfort at the operator's workplace by 3-5 dB.

In a trial for preventing wild boar ingress into maize fields different designs of electric fence system were used. The trial in which we used an electric fence to prevent wild boar from entering a maize field was erected in the area of Å mihel near Postojna (Slovenia). We decided to erect the electric fence at the end of July, after the fertilization of the maize. The following designs of electric fence systems were used: 1) a plastic post with a polywire and two polytapes with spacings of 15, 15, and 30 cm between them; 2) a plastic post with polywire and a polytape with spacings 25 and 25 cm between them; 3) a steal post as a wire offset in an inverted L shape on which three screws on rod insulators were fixed at a height of 15, 30, and 55 cm from the ground. A polytape at a height of 30 cm acted as depth and it was a so-called three-dimensional design of electric fence.

However, there is an urgent need to assess the environmental performance of prefabrication technology to identify whether it is an effective method that is conducive to sustainable development. This study considered two typical residential projects using the two technologies to conduct a fair comparison between prefabrication technology and cast-in-situ technology. Various measuring methods, including content analysis, face-to-face interviews and on-site measurements, were used for data collection. Environmental impact (EI) categories selected for the study included resource depletion, energy consumption and construction waste discharge. Two life cycle assessment (LCA)-based models, the construction environmental performance assessment system (CEPAS) and the building health impact assessment system (BHIAS), were integrated to measure the EI of the two construction technologies based on three damage categories, namely, ecosystem damage, resource depletion and health damage. Finally, social willingness to pay (WTP) was applied to integrate the damage categories for comparisons. The results indicated that the sample prefabricated residential building (PRB) construction was more efficient in energy use, with a 20.49% reduction in total consumption compared to the sample traditional residential building (TRB) construction. The use of prefabrication demonstrated a certain degree of advantages in EI, including a 35.82% reduction in resource depletion, a 6.61% reduction in health damage and a 3.47% reduction in ecosystem damage. Prefabrication technology was more environmentally friendly because of its advantages in reducing damage to the environment compared with traditional cast-in-situ construction technology.
[7]: The benefits of prefabrication are well known and include increased efficiency, greater economy, and safety in construction operations. There have also been anecdotal references to the reduction of construction waste as a result of prefabrication but there are little empirical studies to support this assertion. The current study undertakes an investigation to establish the influence, prefabrication can have on the amount of construction waste generation. Data was gathered through the collation of the perspective views of 47 construction practitioners and stakeholders who have professional experience in the New Zealand construction industry. Quantitative method of analysis was chosen for ease of understanding. The results indicated greater levels of prefabrication corresponded to lower levels of construction waste generation. However, the key to achieving construction waste minimisation targets lies in better supervision of the quality of prefabricated products. The study concludes that more training, education, and awareness is needed within the prefabrication sub-sector to realise waste minimisation on construction projects.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that prefabricated buildings lead to reduced waste, lower energy consumption, and minimized environmental impact. The provided reference includes two parts: one study shows that prefabricated construction reduced energy consumption by about 20.49% compared to traditional methods and demonstrated lower environmental impact in terms of resource depletion, health damage, and ecosystem damage; the other study supports that greater prefabrication correlates with lower levels of construction waste.

s_1605,Unverifiable,"Biological Control: Certain insects can be used to control specific weed species. For example, the water hyacinth weevil is effective against water hyacinth, and the weed flea beetle targets Alternanthera philoxeroides .","[9] Agriculture occupies an important place in improving the living standards of farmers in Pakistan. About 90% of farm earnings rely on the cultivation of sugar, fibre, cereals and legumes. Due to lack of essential resources and technical expertise, every year thousands of farmers fail to reach maximum yield potential. Over 70% of farmers own less than 5 ha in Pakistan; therefore, it is uneconomic to employ costly mechanical and chemical strategies for the control of pests in their crops. Among these pests, we eds are considered to be the major obstacle to crop production, and can ultimately result in crop failure. Traditionally, manipulation of cropping techniques was employed for the control of weeds; later on, development of synthetic chemical herbicides made it easier to control weeds in a very short time period. However, over time the increased use of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns, weed population shifts, and increased managerial costs have made it difficult for farmers to control these weed species within their limited economic resources. Nowadays, scientists and research organizations are being urged to provide innovative weed management solutions, with minimal ecological impacts. Studies have revealed the importance of cultural strategies for the management of weeds in different cropping systems. Research has proved that alternation of cultural practices, and selection of competitive crop cultivars, could be a possible strategy to minimize the competitiveness of weeds. Increased crop densities, narrower row spacing, intercropping and alternation in row directions are among the weed control strategies gaining rapid attention in many countries. Unfortunately, limited information is available about weed management using crop competition in Pakistan. This review article focusses on the importance of these agronomic practices in reducing the competitive potential of weeds, for their effective and appropriate management in major crops of Pakistan. It is intended to assist researchers in the design of economically viable and eco-friendly weed management strategies, which will aid in eliminating the burden of herbicides and mechanical cultivation from farmer's production costs. [10] In Spain, agriculture triggers soil degradation and erosion processes. New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or maintain soil functionality in order to achieve a sustainable agriculture. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different agricultural management on soil properties and soil erosion. Five different treatments (ploughing, herbicide, control, straw mulch and chipped pruned branches) were established in ""El Teularet experimental station"" located in the Sierra de Enguera (Valencia, Spain). Soil sampling was conducted prior to treatment establishment, and again after 16 months, to determine soil organic matter content (OM), aggregate stability (AS), and microbial biomass carbon content (C<inf>mic</inf>). Fifty rainfall simulations tests (55 mm during one hour, 5-year return period) were applied to measure soil and water losses under each treatment. The highest values of OM, AS and C<inf>mic</inf> were observed in the straw-covered plot, where soil and water losses were negligible. On the contrary, the plot treated with herbicides had the highest soil losses and a slight reduction in C<inf>mic</inf>. Soil erosion control was effective after 16 months on the plots where vegetation was present while on the ploughed and herbicide-treated plots, the practices were not sustainable due to large water and soil losses. Except for the straw mulch plot, soil properties (OM, AS, C<inf>mic</inf>) were not enhanced by the new land managements, but soil erosion control was achieved on three of the five plots used (weeds, weeds plus straw and weeds plus chipped pruned branches). Erosion control strategies such as weeds, weeds plus straw mulch and weeds plus chipped branches mulch are highly efficient in reducing soil losses on traditional herbicide-treated and ploughed agricultural land. However, it takes longer to recover other soil properties such as OM, AS, and C<inf>mic</inf>. [20] Summary: There are many agronomic variables and management strategies other than herbicides that can be manipulated to discourage weed invasion. Combining several management strategies rather than relying on one will increase the likelihood of successful weed management. Encouraging optimal crop canopy health can guide decision-making and render agricultural land less susceptible to weed invasion. Then, when necessary, herbicides can be judiciously used to supplement cultural weed management techniques. In this review we have attempted to address two of the three major habitat characteristics that influence weed invasions - disturbances and, to a lesser extent, high resource ability. The remaining habitat characteristic, low species diversity, is difficult to address in modern agriculture, but can be an avenue of defence against invading species [89]. However, even intercropping, which is an effective ecological weed management technique [90], does not approach species diversity levels in natural ecosystems. A compromise to high species diversity in space is to maximize species diversity in time; this is best accomplished by ensuring that a given field is subjected to diverse rotational crops. Diverse crop rotations are probably the most effective management tool in maintaining crop health and limiting weed invasion opportunities. In the future, very clean (near weed-free) fields may not be considered acceptable [91]. We might do well to alter our view of what is desirable: from an ultra-clean crop with no weeds visible to a more species-rich field with sub-threshold communities of weeds. This approach could be termed ecological weed management [92]. Pest management in disciplines other than weed science may benefit from a few weeds [93, 94]. For example, root maggot (Delia spp) egg deposition and larval damage were reduced in plots where weeds were left in canola longer than the period recommended for optimal yields [95]. Combining and applying the techniques discussed above, reducing herbicide use, and tolerating low infestations of weeds may be the most sustainable form of weed management over the long-term. Ignoring ecological weed management techniques and maintaining current herbicide application practices will ensure a higher frequency of weed invasions of the resistant type [96, 97]. © 2005 Birkhäuser Verlag.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim discusses the use of specific insects (water hyacinth weevil and weed flea beetle) for biological control of particular weeds.

Among the risk factors for psoriasis, evidence is accumulating that nutrition plays a major role, per se, in psoriasis pathogenesis. In particular, body weight, nutrition, and diet may exacerbate the clinical manifestations, or even trigger the disease. Understanding the epidemiological relationship between obesity and psoriasis is also important for delineating the risk profile for the obesity-related comorbidities commonly found among psoriatic patients. Moreover, obesity can affect both drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Additionally, the overall beneficial effects on the obesity-associated comorbidities, clinical recommendations to reduce weight and to adopt a healthy lifestyle could improve the psoriasis severity, particularly in those patients with moderate to severe disease, thus exerting additional therapeutic effects in the conventional treatment in obese patients with psoriasis. Education regarding modifiable environmental factors is essential in the treatment of this disease and represents one of the primary interventions that can affect the prognosis of patients with psoriasis. The goal is to make psoriatic patients and health care providers aware of beneficial dietary interventions.

Knowing this in a specific exercise is the basis of work for rehabilitation and physiotherapy, fitness and self-coaching, augmented reality, animation and gaming, robot management, surveillance and human activity analysis. Implementing such capabilities may use special suits or sensor arrays to achieve the best result, but massive use of PE is related to devices that many users own: namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds.

This multi-sensor approach can help in adjusting grip force and reducing slippage .","[3] Event cameras, i.e., the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) ones, capture the intensity changes in the scene and generates a stream of events in an asynchronous fashion. The output rate of such cameras can reach up to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit from the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5 × 5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images. [5] The Event-Based Sensor (EBS) is a new class of imaging sensor where each pixel independently reports 'events' in response to changes in log intensity, rather than outputting image frames containing the absolute intensity at each pixel. Positive and negative events are emitted from the sensor when the change in log intensity exceeds certain controllable thresholds internal to the device. For objects moving through the field of view, a change in intensity can be related to motion. The sensor records events independently and asynchronously for each pixel with a very high temporal resolution, allowing the detection of objects moving very quickly through the field of view. Recently this type of sensor has been applied to the detection of orbiting space objects using a ground-based telescope. This paper describes a method to treat the data generated by the EBS as a classical detect-then-track problem by collating the events spatially and temporally to form target measurements. An efficient multi-target tracking algorithm, the probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (PMHT) is then applied to the EBS measurements to produce tracks. This method is demonstrated by automatically generating tracks on orbiting space objects from data collected by the EBS. [10] Event-based vision, as realized by bio-inspired Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), is gaining more and more popularity due to its advantages of high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range and power efficiency at the same time. Potential applications include surveillance, robotics, and autonomous navigation under uncontrolled environment conditions. In this paper, we deal with event-based vision for 3D reconstruction of dynamic scene content by using two stationary DVS in a stereo configuration.

This includes the reliance on non-renewable energy sources and the elimination of energy efficiency requirements for AI models.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability are two sides of same coin. AI is a reliable ally in the fight for sustainability, leading us to a brighter future. AI illuminates renewable energy, resource management, and eco-friendly decision-making by analyzing large datasets. However, the energy usage and carbon footprint of AI models and AI sustainability are increasingly under review. This research paper examines the environmental implications of AI models, focusing on ChatGPT, and emphasizes the necessity for sustainable AI development. Recent studies show that AI model creation and use significantly impact the global carbon footprint due to energy, water, and carbon emissions. With its massive computational needs, ChatGPT contributes to environmental issues. To tackle this dilemma, sustainable AI development must be promoted. Model compression, quantization, and knowledge distillation improve AI energy efficiency. The use of renewable energy and the establishment and enforcement of AI model energy efficiency requirements are equally crucial. ChatGPT and comparable models can be environmentally friendly by using sustainable AI development methods. In this line, the objective of the present study is to analyze the impact of the use of AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, on sustainability and environmental protection by analyzing existing reports and studies on the environmental impact of artificial intelligence models. Academicians, developers, politicians, institutions and organizations must work together to create rules and frameworks for energy-efficient AI algorithms, renewable energy use, and responsible deployment.

Examples: Firefly Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Genetic Algorithms (GA) .","Searching for information on the Web engages the user in a process of questioning for the choice of search engines. However, many Internet users suffer for the information choice which these search engines receive. On the other hand, if the queries do not express their needs or else their objectives, this implies that some information is not formulated, requiring the reformulation of these queries. In this paper, an approach of bio-inspired optimization based on the FireFly Algorithm is used to formulate the query by providing a new suggestion. This algorithm has been applied on the frequent itemsets generated by FP-Growth (frequent-pattern Growth). Moreover, every user interaction with the search engine has been treated as a Firefly path. The algorithmic solution allows the user to select the best path (which contains key words) among all possible solutions for the initial query. Experimentally, we study the performance of the proposed method in comparison to different techniques (particle swarms optimization and genetic algorithms).
[6]: The fundamental aim of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of data by removing irrelevant and redundant features. As finding out the best subset of features from all possible subsets is computationally expensive, especially for high dimensional data sets, meta-heuristic algorithms are often used as a promising method for addressing the task. In this paper, a variant of recent meta-heuristic approach Owl Search Optimization algorithm (OSA) has been proposed for solving the feature selection problem within a wrapper-based framework. Several strategies are incorporated with an aim to strengthen BOSA (binary version of OSA) in searching the global best solution. The meta-parameter of BOSA is initialized dynamically and then adjusted using a self-adaptive mechanism during the search process. Besides, elitism and mutation operations are combined with BOSA to control the exploitation and exploration better. This improved BOSA is named in this paper as Modified Binary Owl Search Algorithm (MBOSA). Decision Tree (DT) classifier is used for wrapper based fitness function, and the final classification performance of the selected feature subset is evaluated by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Simulation experiments are conducted on twenty well-known benchmark datasets from UCI for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, and the results are reported based on classification accuracy, the number of selected features, and execution time. In addition, BOSA along with three common meta-heuristic algorithms Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) are used for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar methods by reducing the number of features significantly while maintaining a comparable level of classification accuracy.
[7]: In this paper the optimal performance of time modulated nine-ring concentric circular antenna array with isotropic elements has been studied based on an evolutionary optimization algorithm hybridized with local heuristic search called memetic firefly algorithm (MFA). The firefly algorithm has been applied followed by Nelder–Mead simplex method for the local heuristic search to achieve the optimal fine tuning. Other algorithms like real coded genetic algorithm (RGA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been used for the comparison purpose. The comparisons among the algorithms have been made with two case studies as Case-1 and Case-2, and with two different fitness functions (Formula presented.) and three control parameters like inter-element uniform/non-uniform spacing in rings, inter-ring radii and the switching-on times of rings. The simulation results show that the MFA outperforms RGA and PSO for both the cases Case-1, Case-2 and (Formula presented.) , (Formula presented.) , respectively with respect to better side lobe level (SLL). The fitness function (Formula presented.) is better than the (Formula presented.) with respect to sideband level. Apart from this, powers radiated at the centre/fundamental frequency and the first two sideband frequencies, and dynamic efficiency have been computed. It is found that power radiated by any sideband frequency is much less as compared to the power radiated at the centre frequency. It has been observed that as the sideband frequency increases, SBL decreases to the greater extent as compared to SLL.

Various trust assessment frameworks and security measures are employed to address these concerns, and it is likely that future advancements in quantum computing will further enhance the security protocols used in IoT environments .","The Internet of Things (IoT) provides a new paradigm for the development of heterogeneous and distributed systems, and it has increasingly become a ubiquitous computing service platform. However, due to the lack of sufficient computing and storage resources dedicated to the processing and storage of huge volumes of the IoT data, it tends to adopt a cloud-based architecture to address the issues of resource constraints. Hence, a series of challenging security and trust concerns have arisen in the cloud-based IoT context. To this end, a novel trust assessment framework for the security and reputation of cloud services is proposed. This framework enables the trust evaluation of cloud services in order to ensure the security of the cloud-based IoT context via integrating security- and reputation-based trust assessment methods. The security-based trust assessment method employs the cloud-specific security metrics to evaluate the security of a cloud service. Furthermore, the feedback ratings on the quality of cloud service are exploited in the reputation-based trust assessment method in order to evaluate the reputation of a cloud service. The experiments conducted using a synthesized dataset of security metrics and a real-world web service dataset show that our proposed trust assessment framework can efficiently and effectively assess the trustworthiness of a cloud service while outperforming other trust assessment methods.

Moreover, in some use cases large volume of sensitive data could be generated. The number of security threats related to Infrastructure, platform and application of IoT has been increased over the last few years. So, it is necessary to apply proper security solutions which ensure privacy and confidentiality of data. To address the secure and reliable communication, various trust-based solutions were introduced. Most of the nodes in IoT system are heterogeneous and limited storage space. The existing trust management protocols do not scale well to accommodate this requirement. This article provides a detailed review of the security challenges and trust management techniques adopted for IoT to secure data in a cloud environment.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses security and trust management frameworks for cloud-based IoT environments and reviews various trust assessment and security methods.

i_73,Entailment,"Key Effects of Imbalanced Data: Bias Towards Majority Class: Classifiers often predict the majority class, which can sometimes result in misleadingly high overall accuracy, while the minority class performance is generally acceptable .","Class imbalance occurs when the distribution of classes between the majority and the minority classes is not the same. The data on imbalanced classes may vary from mild to severe. The effect of highclass imbalance may affect the overall classification accuracy since the model is most likely to predict most of the data that fall within the majority class. Such a model will give biased results, and the performance predictions for the minority class often have no impact on the model. The use of the oversampling technique is one way to deal with high-class imbalance, but only a few are used to solve data imbalance. This study aims for an in-depth performance analysis of the oversampling techniques to address the high-class imbalance problem. The addition of the oversampling technique will balance each class's data to provide unbiased evaluation results in modeling. We compared the performance of Random Oversampling (ROS), ADASYN, SMOTE, and Borderline-SMOTE techniques. All oversampling techniques will be combined with machine learning methods such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). The test results show that Random Forest with Borderline-SMOTE gives the best value with an accuracy value of 0.9997, 0.9474 precision, 0.8571 recall, 0.9000 F1-score, 0.9388 ROCAUC, and 0.8581 PRAUC of the overall oversampling technique.
[2]: Imbalance data are defined as a dataset whose proportion of classes is severely skewed. Classification performance of existing models tends to deteriorate due to class distribution imbalance. In addition, over-representation by majority classes prevents a classifier from paying attention to minority classes, which are generally more interesting. An effective ensemble classification method called RHSBoost has been proposed to address the imbalance classification problem. This classification rule uses random undersampling and ROSE sampling under a boosting scheme. According to the experimental results, RHSBoost appears to be an attractive classification model for imbalance data.
[3]: In recent research, classification involving imbalanced datasets has received considerable attention. Most classification algorithms tend to predict that most of the incoming data belongs to the majority class, resulting in the poor classification performance in minority class instances, which are usually of much more interest. In this paper we propose a clustering-based subset ensemble learning method for handling class imbalanced problem. In the proposed approach, first, new balanced training datasets are produced using clustering-based under-sampling, then, further classification of new training sets are performed by applying four algorithms: Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, KNN and SVM, as the base algorithms in combined-bagging. An experimental analysis is carried out over a wide range of highly imbalanced data sets. The results obtained show that our method can improve imbalance classification performance of rare and normal classes stably and effectively.",Entailment,"justification: The claim asserts that although classifiers tend to favor the majority class—leading to misleadingly high overall accuracy—the performance for the minority class is generally acceptable. However, the reference indicates that due to class imbalance, models are biased toward the majority class and that the minority class often has little or no impact on the overall performance. In particular, the reference describes the consequence of such imbalance as poor performance on minority class instances, which directly contradicts the claim's assertion.

i_574,Entailment,Practical Implementation Issues Integration with Existing Systems: Integrating computer vision and image processing methods with existing emergency response systems can be complex. It requires seamless coordination between various technologies and real-time data exchange to ensure situational awareness and effective response .,"The importance of an optimal solution for disaster evacuation has recently raised attention from researchers across multiple disciplines. This is not only a serious, but also a challenging task due to the complexities of the evacuees' behaviors, route planning, and demanding coordination services. Although existing studies have addressed these challenges to some extent, mass evacuation in natural disasters tends to be difficult to predict and manage due to the limitation of the underlying models to capture realistic situations. It is therefore desirable to have on-demand mechanisms of locally-driven computing and data exchange services in order to enable near real-time capture of the disaster area during the evacuation. For this purpose, this paper comprehensively surveys recent advances in information and communication technology-enabled disaster evacuations, with the focus on fog computation and communication services to support a massive evacuation process. A numerous variety of tools and techniques are encapsulated within a coordinated on-demand strategy of an evacuation platform, which is aimed to provide a situational awareness and response. Herein fog services appear to be one of the viable options for responsive mass evacuation because they enable low latency data processing and dissemination. They can additionally provide data analytics support for autonomous learning for both the short-term guidance supports and long-term usages. This work extends the existing data-oriented framework by outlining comprehensive functionalities and providing seamless integration. We review the principles, challenges, and future direction of the state-of-the-art strategies proposed to sit within each functionality. Taken together, this survey highlights the importance of adaptive coordination and reconfiguration within the fog services to facilitate responsive mass evacuations as well as open up new research challenges associated with analytics-embedding network and computation, which is critical for any disaster recovery activities.

The use of smaller quantities of construction materials, materials of higher quality and durability, and recycling of construction waste are all requirements of today's aspiration for a circular economy, but it is necessary to assess their environmental and economic sustainability. This paper presents a review of the current assessment tools of circular economy projects applied to the construction industry, such as LCA, LCC and CBA. The main objectives of this study were to provide a categorization of CE concepts applied in the construction industry (CI) and to review assessment methods used for evaluating CE projects in CI. This paper selected and reviewed 96 published papers and classified them into one of five aspects of CE highlighted in this study: waste management, reducing the impact on the environment, material & product design, building design, and other. The results showed that the use of assessment methods in CE projects has increased in the recent years as well that an LCA was by far the most used assessment method and waste management the most common aspect of CE in CI.
[3]: In construction, the focus of research and policy on sustainability broadened from reducing the energy consumption of a building in use, to a comprehensive sustainability strategy considering the building's entire life cycle. However, the implementation of life cycle thinking (and its operational counterpart the circular economy) in combination with an objective sustainability evaluation is still in its infancy. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, it is illustrative for the quantified assessment of the potential environmental and financial benefits and burdens of introducing circular design alternatives for internal wall assemblies to the Belgian market. Second, it reviews the methodological implications on the results of a consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and a life cycle costing (LCC), acknowledging the time dependence and closed-loop nature of those circular design alternatives. That aim is achieved through a multi-model set-up. Evaluating the design alternatives through various methodological assumptions and service life models, allows understanding the relevance and robustness of the results by acknowledging the corresponding uncertainty. In total seven alternative wall assemblies are assessed over a period of 60 years, with a refurbishment every 15 year. The results, without considering the impact of biogenic CO <inf>2</inf> nor the influence of thermal mass, show that a low life cycle impact can be achieved for assemblies that are designed to be used again and have a higher initial impact, such as a plywood boarding connected in a reversible way to demountable metal frame substructure, as well as for assemblies with no possibilities for direct reuse that have a low initial impact, such as a drywall system with a wooden substructure. In addition to the environmental assessment, the life cycle cost of the demountable and reusable wall assemblies with a metal substructure is 10 and 17% lower than that of the conventional alternative with the lowest life cycle cost. Further, regarding the methodological scenarios on marginal supplier identification in the consequential LCA, the range of possible outcomes is however much larger for the demountable wall assemblies than for the conventional ones. For the conventional wall assemblies there is only a small divergence in results of around 10% between the scenarios, while for the demountable ones this deviation rises to 25%. Altogether, this case study points out the potential benefits of introducing demountable and reusable walls, but highlights at the same time the need for a comprehensive sustainability assessment before responsible conclusions can be drawn.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim asserts that using Life Cycle Costing (LCC) alongside Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate the economic sustainability of circular economy (CE) projects implies that all CE projects are economically viable.

There is no indication in the reference that these methods confirm that all CE projects are economically viable; rather, they leave room for evaluating varying outcomes and uncertainties.

Battery Management System (BMS) plays a prominent role in monitoring and controlling of rechargeable batteries. The key terminologies in BMS are as follows, the prime selection of battery chemistry is essential for meticulous applications followed by technologies in battery management systems it includes battery monitoring, diagnostics,control of charging and discharging cycle, state estimate, protection, equalization of charge, heat control and management, early failure detection and assessment to improve overall system performance. An effective BMS protects the battery from damage, forecasts lifetime and maintains battery efficiency. BMS can optimize downtime and battery lifespan per discharge cycle. Finally the outcome of this paper is to identify the best battery chemistry, charging methods, battery model, cell balancing and SOC estimation techniques.
[5]: Battery management system (BMS) is the most important part of an electronic vehicle (EV), and the management module for single cell is the most important collection part of BMS. It provides cells' data and realizes cells management for BMS. In this paper, the design and realization of the management module for single cell is presented. It can collect real-time voltage and temperature data of cells, and carry on the necessary processing for such data, and then upload these data to the main control module in the battery management system. The design can also equalize the cells, and made their voltage remain in a standard. For the proposed design scheme, the microcontroller PIC24F16KA101 is used as the core part, and the multi-cell addressable battery stack monitor LTC6802 is utilized as the collection part. Moreover, the design of multi-channel data collection and management system, and the design of software and hardware for interface are given. The practical experimental results show that the system can realize the real-time multi-channel signal collection, offer useful data for battery management system, and equalize the cells at power on or power off situation, so as to guarantee the battery consistency. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference strongly supports the grid energy storage aspect, detailing A123 Systems’ use of Nanophosphate™ battery-based systems for ancillary services in electric markets.

i_875,Unverifiable,###  ** Principles of Electropolishing** -  ** Anodic Dissolution** : Electropolishing involves the metal workpiece acting as the anode in an electrolytic cell. Metal ions dissolve from the surface into the electrolyte .,"As a popular application of electrochemical anodic dissolution, electropolishing is extensively adopted in the surface finishing industries of metals. Anodic dissolution is a complex reaction with many process parameters and chemical properties involved. A simple explanation of the mechanism of morphology formation during the EP reaction is still lacking. This study examines the morphology formation of stainless steel 304 at the same location on the specimen as the process evolves. Based on these observations, the basic mechanisms of morphology formation in EP process are proposed. The bubble shielding effect (BSE) and the broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explain the raised and dented morphologies, respectively. The broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explains the formation mechanism of pitting holes and the bubbleshielding effect (BSE) explains the limitation of surface roughness of electropolishing process. Simulation results are consistent with the observed morphology formation phenomena. © 2012 by ESG.
[5]: Chemical polishing or electropolishing, instead of mechanical polishing, are recommended for the attainment of metallic surface polishes without the introduction of contaminants or tensions in the surface layers of the metal. The fundamental difference between the chemical and electrochemical polishing processes is that in the latter anodic currents/potentials are used to help in the dissolution and passivation of the metal. In this paper, the use of an oxidizing electrolytic solution (2.5 mol L<sup>-1</sup> CrO<inf>3</inf> + 5.0 mol L<sup>-1</sup> H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>) originally employed in electrochemical coloration processes is reported for the electropolishing of AISI-314 stainless steel. Parameters involved in this electropolishing process, such as temperature, current density and time, were optimized so as to attain the best possible results evaluated by the obtained surface brightness measured by reflectance spectra. Surface analyses by scanning electron microscopy allowed a clear correlation between obtained brightness and surface smoothing. The best conditions obtained for the electropolishing process are: temperature of 45°C, electrolysis time of 10 min and current density of around 25 A dm <sup>-2</sup>. It should be pointed out that an electropolishing process signature (periodic oscillations of the cell potential) was established; this may be an important tool for optimizing and monitoring electropolishing processes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Fermentation made the musts less brown and more yellow, whereas ageing made them darker and increased their brown, reddish and yellowish hues. Overall, the musts fermented to 8% vol ethanol exhibited higher odour activity values (OAVs). In addition, the musts aged with oak chips were slightly different from those without chips. Expert tasters gave the highest scores to the musts fermented to 8% (v/v) ethanol with 2 g/L of oak chips added. The winemaking process studied would allow the existing range of sweet wines from dried grapes to be expanded by using a fast, flexible, hygienic procedure.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that aging with oak chips does not significantly change the sensory properties of sweet wines and diminishes their complexity and appeal.

Technological advances are allowing higher capacity turbines to be installed and in deeper water, but there is still much that is unknown about the effects on the environment. Here we describe the lessons learned based on the recent literature and our experience with assessing impacts of offshore wind developments on marine mammals and seabirds, and make recommendations for future monitoring and assessment as interest in offshore wind energy grows around the world. The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. As the number and size of offshore wind developments increases, there will be a growing need to consider the population level consequences and cumulative impacts of these activities on marine species. Strategically targeted data collection and modeling aimed at answering questions for the consenting process will also allow regulators to make decisions based on the best available information, and achieve a balance between climate change targets and environmental legislation.

Static assignment of identities is a cornerstone for adversaries in finding targets. Moving Target Defense (MTD) mutates the environment to increase unpredictability for an attacker. On another side, Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitate a global view of a network through a central control point. The potential of SDN can not only make network management flexible and convenient, but it can also assist MTD to enhance attack surface obfuscation. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of flooding-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our framework includes a lightweight SDN assisted MTD strategy for network reconnaissance protection and an efficient approach for tackling DoS attacks using Software Defined-Internet Exchange Point (SD-IXP). To assess the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and DoS mitigation scheme, we set two different experiments. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our framework. With the MTD strategy in place, at maximum, barely 16% reconnaissance attempts were successful while the DoS attacks were accurately detected with false alarm rate as low as 7.1%.

However, practical implementation often faces barriers, including stakeholder acceptance and alignment with broader sustainability goals .","The contemporary debate and research on transit-oriented development (TOD) has continued to progress within the context of sustainable development. At its core, this refers to providing essential transit services with an efficient manner which is achieved by including accessible public transport, mixed land use, and walkable neighbourhoods so as to reduce the volume of private cars on the road. We have analysed the theoretical development of TOD studies. Based on a scientometric analysis, this paper has collected 442 TOD articles through the Web of Science and used VOSviewer to visually map and analyse four main topics of TOD studies, including ""correlation among TOD, smart growth and land use"", ""TOD financing and the impacts of TOD on housing price"", ""impacts of TOD on travel behaviour"", and ""correlation among TOD attractiveness, accessibility and ridership"". And we also provide the current status of research and implications for Australia.
[6]: Cities' sustainability strategies seem to aim at the reduction of the negative impacts of urban freight transport. In the past decades, many public and private initiatives have struggled to gain broad stakeholder support and thus remain viable. Researchers and practitioners have only recently recognised stakeholder acceptance of urban freight solutions as a challenge. A first step in achieving convergence is to understand stakeholder needs, preferences and viewpoints. This paper proposes and applies an approach to identify the main stakeholder perspectives in the domain of urban freight transport. We use Q-methodology, which originates from social sciences and psychology, to record subjective positions and identify the dominant ones. We explain the approach, operationalise the method for the domain of urban freight transport and apply it to stakeholder groups in the Netherlands. We find four dominant perspectives, reflecting how stakeholders normally take positions in the urban freight dialogue. Important findings concern disparities between industry associations and some of their membership, divergent views about the expected role of public administration, and the observation that the behaviour of shippers and Logistics Service Providers (LSP) appears to be inconsistent with their beliefs. All these factors together can act as a barrier to the implementation of urban freight consolidation concepts. The Q-methodology is valuable for eliciting perspectives in urban freight and is a promising tool to facilitate stakeholder dialogue and, eventually, convergence.",Entailment,"justification: The reference first outlines the core features of TOD—accessible public transport, mixed land use, and walkable neighbourhoods—that are designed to reduce private car dependency, which supports the first part of the claim. Additionally, while the claim notes that implementation faces challenges such as stakeholder acceptance and alignment with broader sustainability goals, the reference (particularly in the second part) discusses how public and private initiatives in urban strategies have struggled to gain broad stakeholder support. Although the reference does not explicitly mention “alignment with broader sustainability goals,” it does indicate that stakeholder acceptance issues present practical barriers in urban planning settings. Combining these points, the reference provides enough direct support for TOD’s benefits and enough evidence of implementation challenges to entail the claim.

Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite reinforcement can be used in concrete structures instead of steel rebars. This composite rebar prevents the degradation of concrete structures from moisture effects. Moreover, this composite rebar reduces the structural weight and continuous fiber composites are able to arrest cracks and prevent self-similar crack propagation. However, a number of design parameters such as fiber orientation patterns and choices of constituent material combinations provide a multiplicity of design options for this structure, which requires a priori quantification of progressive damage in this composite structure and its fracture characteristics. In this paper, durability and damage tolerance (D&DT) of concrete beams with FRP composite reinforcement under static loading is evaluated using a multi-scale micro-macro progressive failure analysis (PFA) technique that augments commercial FE stress solvers. PFA predicts damage initiation and propagation, fracture initiation and propagation, and the final residual strength in the structure. The prediction is validated with experiment data obtained from full-scale beam tests. In the experiment, each specimen was tested in four-point bending with different specification. Simulation results show in detail the damage progression sequence and structural response characteristics during different degradation stages. Computational simulation provides an alternative evaluation method, giving engineers a detailed description of durability and damage tolerance would take place in the process of ultimate fracture of concrete structures with FRP reinforcement.
[10]: A continued process exists to implement innovative materials to enhance the sustainability and durability of the built infrastructure. Technologies developed over the last two decades have facilitated the use of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites as internal reinforcement bars (rebars) for concrete structures, which have proven to be an alternative to traditional steel reinforcement due to significant advantages, such as magnetic transparency and, most importantly, corrosion resistance, equating to durability and structural life extension. This study evaluated the durability of three different commercially available and most commonly used GFRP rebar types for resistance to aggressive environments, such as those experienced in coastal areas. In total, 216 specimens were exposed to seawater, at various temperatures (23, 40 and 60°C) for different time periods (60 and 120 days). The durability of these GFRP rebars was assessed by testing five different physio-mechanical properties, including: tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, transverse and horizontal shear strength, and bond-strength to concrete. Preliminary results show that the durability of the GFRP rebars after being exposed to seawater at different temperatures, varies considerably among the three different rebar types. Among the tested physio-mechanical properties, tensile strength suffered the highest degradation.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference clearly discusses that corrosion of steel reinforcement induces deterioration in concrete structures. Although it does not explicitly mention “maintenance costs” or “repairs and rehabilitation,” the implication is that deterioration due to corrosion would naturally lead to increased maintenance requirements.

i_1845,Contradiction,"Benefits of Circular Economy: Social: Generates employment opportunities, promotes sustainable practices, and enhances the quality of life by reducing environmental degradation .","Reuse and recirculation of products and materials are the basis of the concept of the circular economy (CE). The CE is an innovative proposal that can result in positive impacts such as reduced demand for raw materials, reduced consumption of basic resources, and job creation, as well as preventing negative impacts resulting from the exploitation and processing of natural resources. Mining is infamous for its potential environmental impact, but mining waste from traditional mining (in the linear economy) may recover material through upcycling techniques, as can urban mining of industrial and post-consumer waste categories (in the circular economy). Urban mining, a form of closed-loop supply chain management, offers an attractive alternative to the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste) and, at the same time, as a sustainable way to exploit mineral resources, reduces primary material intake and stimulates the circularity in the supply chain. The present study reviews the main CE solutions for e-waste management, highlighting the importance of recovering and classifying mineral material according to urban mining procedures.
[15]: The performance economy is a concept which goes beyond most interpretations of a ""circular economy"": the focus is on the maintenance and exploitation of stock (mainly manufactured capital) rather than linear or circular flows of materials or energy. The performance economy represents a full shift to servicisation, with revenue obtained from providing services rather than selling goods. While the form of industrial economy which has dominated the industrialised countries since the industrial revolution is arguably appropriate to overcome scarcities in a developing economy, the performance model is applicable in economies close to saturation, when the quantities of new goods entering use are similar to the quantities of goods being scrapped at the end of life. Key elements of the performance economy are re-use and re-manufacturing, to maintain the quality of stock and extend its service life by reducing material intensity, i.e. the material flow required to create and maintain the stock. Because material flows represent costs which reduce the revenue from service provision, business models inherent in the performance economy support the macro-level objective of extending service life and thereby minimising material intensity. Product life in the performance economy is limited by technological improvements in the efficiency of manufactured capital rather than by damage, wear or fashion. Re-use and re-manufacturing tend to be more labour-intensive and less capital-intensive than virgin material production or primary manufacturing. This enables re-use and remanufacturing to be economically viable at smaller scales. It also enables these activities to substitute labour for energy, reversing the trend which has characterised industrial economies and offering ways to alleviate current environmental, economic and global challenges; i.e. to make the economy more sustainable. However, there are significant barriers to adoption of the performance economy model, partly because economic and business models generally focus on flows (GDP or added value) rather than prioritising the quality, value and use of stock. Promoting the performance model may require a complete re-think of public policy, away from subsiding to taxing use of non-renewable resources and away from taxing the use of renewable resources, of which labour is possibly the most important. Recent analyses of the social costs of unemployment and potential social benefits of a more resource efficient performance economy provide some of the evidence supporting a shift from flow to stock management.",Missing information,"justification: The reference describes the circular economy as promoting job creation and sustainable practices by reducing raw material consumption and preventing negative environmental impacts.

Education and Cultural Change: Engineering Education: While transforming engineering education to emphasize sustainability as a core design constraint is important, it is likely that simply integrating sustainability into the curriculum will automatically lead to a systems-oriented perspective among students, without the need for significant cultural change or additional support .","The importance of sustainability to engineering work cannot be denied. Consider, for example, that in the 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama pledged that 80% of the energy used in the United States will come from clean energy sources by 2035.1 Perhaps unprecedented, we face enormous problems like global climate change, poverty, overpopulation, diminishing resources, and pollution, to name a few. The dominant view of engineers' role in this current state of affairs is that of problem solver, or rescuer, such that engineers need only ""design their way out"" of any problems we face as a global society. Rather than a reactionary focus, engineers must be proactive and contemplative and emphasize sustainability as a top design constraint to be considered thoughtfully in terms of people, nature, and future generations. A focus on sustainability must be as heavily weighted as cost, aesthetics, ease of use, etc. But, if we are to get there, we must first change the culture of engineering education. Currently, engineering education treats sustainability as one of many design constraints that likely receives consideration in a classroom module, typically in a capstone design class. One lesson is hardly enough to instill in students the importance of sustainability and sustainable design considerations. While some colleges of engineering have taken on grand educational initiatives to educate students about sustainability and the importance of sustainable design,2-3 we still have an uphill climb to truly transform engineering education to be more focused on sustainable, systems-oriented design, and problem solving. One first step to transforming the culture is to learn how students view sustainability and its relationship to engineering. This is especially important since notions of sustainability and sustainable engineering are wide and varied.4 In this paper, we present Mechanical Engineering students' conceptions of sustainability and how sustainability relates to engineering. Mechanical Engineering, in particular, is a discipline representing great potential in terms of advancing sustainable solutions to our global environmental problems. Yet, the majority of design projects rely on fossil fuels and old technologies that will continue to add CO<inf>2</inf> to the atmosphere.

[7]: Sustainability is increasingly being incorporated into engineering curriculums<sup>1,2</sup>, often due to ABET requirements<sup>3</sup>, but also due to faculty expertise. The United Nations recognizes that achieving sustainable development is only possible if a balance exists between the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental<sup>4</sup>. However, engineering programs can overlook the social dimension by focusing on technological solutions and conflating sustainable development with only environmental protection<sup>5,6</sup>. This paper reports on the evolution of incorporating the social dimensions of sustainability into Engineering for Sustainability, a required sophomore-level course in a Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The course was created in 2003, revised in 2010<sup>7</sup>, and redesigned in 2015-2016. Throughout the history of the course, sustainability was mostly discussed as the application of the basic sciences to engineering issues focused on protecting the environment. Though social issues were present in some lectures, there was little emphasis on social dimensions until the course's redesign in 2015, when the design of sustainable infrastructure became the focus of the course. Activities that centered on the intersection of social issues, urbanization, and sustainable development were introduced in two class sections during a semester. These discussion-based activities have been revised every semester since their implementation in order to improve student learning outcomes, induce more thoughtful conversations among students, and invoke a deeper evaluation of the complexity of the current urban systems. However, it became evident that it was challenging to address important social issues, because of their complexity, in only two class sessions. Developing students' understanding of social and ethical issues related to sustainable development requires full engagement of the course instructor, considerable preparation time, and the development of curriculum that intentionally brings social dimensions of sustainable technology to the forefront. The 2015 redesign of the course included a format change from lecture-based to a blended style that allowed for more student discussions and active learning opportunities. In 2017, additional curricular revision increased student exposure to social issues from two class sessions deeply focused on social issues per semester to at least 80% of the class sessions (even if briefly). The focused class sessions have evolved from a stakeholder debate approach to exercises that emphasize a socio-technical systems framework, stakeholder value mapping, and empathy building. This paper, using written student work, evaluates how the deepening of discussions revolving around social and ethical issues in sustainable urban development have affected student learning and their ability to integrate social and technical issues when thinking about the design of sustainable infrastructure. We evaluate and analyze student work from three activities that represent the evolution of curriculum in this course over the past three years. Results of the analysis suggest that short interventions in this technical course did increase students' awareness of social impact of technologies and students' understanding of complexity in infrastructure and technological changes.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference emphasizes that merely adding sustainability topics to the curriculum (or one lesson) is insufficient to achieve a systems-oriented, sustainable mindset among engineering students.

s_1980,Entailment,"Economic Benefits: Cost Savings: One of the primary motivations for adopting corporate environmental sustainability (CES) strategies is the economic benefit, particularly through cost savings from reducing resource use. This includes measures like energy conservation and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction .","[2] The innovation effect is an important component when measuring the performance of environmental policy instruments. Based on a questionnaire survey, this research has examined corporate energy conservation and emission reduction efforts in energy intensive industries in China under the pressure of different climate policies, and in particular looked into their adoption of those technological innovation and diffusion activities. The results show a large variety of corporate adoption of energy-saving practical activities. In general, climate policies have played a greater role in promoting the adoption of managerial energy-saving activities in respondent companies, while comparatively their influences on the adoption of technology upgrading activities are relatively weak. Regulatory measures have exerted greater pressure and influence on corporate short-term behavioural change, as stated by the respondent companies. However, market based instruments show greater incentive effect in promoting adoption of energy conservation and emission reduction activities that refer to corporate long-term oriented strategic planning or adjustment. For instance they exert a significant incentive effect on increasing long-term research and development investment for technological innovation, and also play an important role in optimising corporate organisational structure. The econometric analysis further proves the influences of market-based instruments in promoting corporate adoption of technological innovation and diffusion activities. [9] This paper examines the relationship between sustainability targets and their impacts on corporate environmental innovation. Using data over the period 2009-2018 on 202 companies from BRICS countries, covering firm-level governance, social responsibility and sustainability this paper examines firm-level sustainability targets, and incentives encourage managers to engage in more environmentally friendly activities. Using panel data probit regression, and after controlling for country-level governance and institutional factors, the study finds that embedding environmental targets in corporate strategy does encourage corporate managers to design and develop eco-friendly products and services, and such firm-level commitments at the top motivates managers to promote, market, and label environmentally friendly products. The findings call for greater emphasis on aligning executive compensation with sustainability targets rather than focusing too much on short-term accounting and market-based measures of firm performance. [13] This paper examines the diffusion of environmental management initiatives in business and the motives and pressures reported by senior executives to adopt these practices in one industry. We frame these sustainable practices under the umbrella of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and examine the causal drivers of environmental behavior. This study used a mixed-methods approach and included a survey and 17 in-depth interviews with professional sports team and league executives. Data revealed both strategic and legitimacy motives to adopt environmental management practices. More specifically, the analysis suggested that strategic motives were the primary reason for adopting an environmental CSR focus. Motives to address institutional pressures were also found, although to a lesser extent. The paper discusses the role and relevance environmentally focused CSR plays in professional sport organizations in North America and presents suggestions for future research in this area.

However, while the reference provides details on corporate adoption of energy conservation and emission reduction activities under different climate policies and discusses both regulatory and market-based influences, it does not clearly state that these practices are primarily driven by a motive to reduce costs or to achieve economic benefits.

s_722,Unverifiable,"Additional Considerations: Cooling and Reheating Effects: The temperature of the build platform and the cooling/reheating behavior during printing can affect the microstructure and interfacial bonding, influencing the resistance stability .","The Fused Filament Fabrication process is the most widely used process for prototyping. The use of variable feedstock material, specimen geometries, pre-processing software, and printers makes comparability and reproducibility challenging, because the part properties not only change with varying print parameters, but also with changes in the slicing routine and tool path generation. The sequential part build-up causes a transient temperature field that affects the local microstructure and interfacial bonding and thus the macroscopic properties. The weld line formation between neighboring beads within layers as well as between layers has been identified as one of the biggest factors affecting mechanical properties. Using a custom python™ program for tool path generation, the cooling and re-heating effect during printing was studied using an IR thermal camera. It was shown that the temperature of the build platform has significant effect on the cooling and reheating behavior. A numerical analysis in ANSYS<sup>®</sup> Mechanical using the element death and birth effect proved that radiation should be included because of the initially high deposition temperatures, and that the presence and size of voids affect the re-heating or cooling rate during the deposition process.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference explains that variations in the build platform temperature lead to marked changes in the cooling and reheating behavior during the printing process. It also states that this transient temperature effect influences the local microstructure and interfacial bonding, which in turn affects the macroscopic properties. Although the claim specifically mentions ""resistance stability"" (a particular macroscopic property), the reference’s discussion of how these factors affect macroscopic properties supports the overall idea. Thus, the reference provides direct support for the claim’s assertions regarding the impact of build platform temperature and thermal behavior on the material’s microstructure and interfacial bonding, which are implied to influence overall properties such as resistance stability.

i_1195,Contradiction,"Recommendations for Healthcare Providers: Healthcare providers should engage caregivers in discussions about medication management, assuming that all caregivers have similar needs and can benefit from the same type of education and support .","Background Family caregivers are actively involved in medication management, yet little is known about factors associated with caregivers' involvement in this role and how that information can be utilized to engage caregivers in the healthcare system. Objectives To explore factors associated with caregiver involvement in various aspects of older adults' medication management (i.e., ordering, keeping track or ensuring the correct medication is taken at the correct time, and injecting medications). Methods A retrospective analysis of two national surveys, the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving was performed. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the associations between demographic and caregiving variables with caregiver involvement in three medication management activities. Results Approximately two-thirds of family caregivers (N = 1369) were involved in one or more medication management activities. Factors associated with caregivers' assistance with ordering medications included being female, high frequency of involvement in instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), involvement in medically-related activities, and caring for an older, less educated, or Hispanic care-recipient and individuals with lung disease or dementia (p < 0.05). Caregiver living arrangement, high frequency of involvement in activities of daily living (ADLs) and IADLs, involvement in medically-related activities along with care-recipient's race/ethnicity and having a dementia diagnosis were all associated with caregiver assistance in keeping track of medications (p < 0.05). Factors associated with assistance in injecting medications were caring for older adults with diabetes or stroke, or being involved in medically-related activities (p < 0.05). Conclusions Different demographic and caregiving factors were associated with caregiver involvement in various medication management activities. Recurring factors included race/ethnicity, certain care-recipient disease states, and caregiver involvement in IADLs and medically-related activities. Healthcare providers can play a proactive role in engaging caregivers in discussion about medication management and these findings can help practitioners more effectively target caregivers for education and support.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim advocates for a blanket approach—assuming all caregivers have similar needs and can benefit from the same educational strategies. However, the reference points out that caregiver involvement in medication management varies based on specific demographic and caregiving factors. It suggests that healthcare providers should target caregivers based on these differing needs rather than assuming uniformity. This discrepancy contradicts the claim’s assumption.

In order to investigate factors that influence households' decision to participate in recycling programs, this research applied directed interviews, observations, and questionnaire surveys to study recycling behavior of 381 randomly selected individuals in Bangkok. The study employed the theory of planed behavior as the main framework and injected sociodemographic, economic, and situational factors into the model to examine how these factors integrate to either stimulate or restrain recycling involvement of people. The results of the estimated logistic regression models suggested that the adequacy of information regarding recycling and resident period in the current place directly predicted recycling behavior, whereas the condition of recycling facility and personal recycling skill provided both a direct effect on the actual behavior and an indirect effect via recycling intention. In contrast, the psychological factors; attitude toward recycling, subjective norm, and awareness of recycling benefit, only indirectly influenced recycling behavior through the intention.

[7]: This paper compares recycling attitudes and behaviours of key participants in Pakistan's plastics recycling supply chains. It involved mainly cross sectional surveys of 360 households and 51 scrap dealers, and multiple case studies with 26 plastics pre-processors and 28 plastics recyclers (moulders/converters) at seven cities in Pakistan. Guided by the model of consumer recycling behaviour proposed by Thøgersen (International Journal of Research in Marketing, 1994, 11, pp. 145-163) this paper found a mix of different attitudes and behaviours. It appears that households lacked awareness of the process involved after plastics recyclables are collected and they lacked opportunity to participate; furthermore their recycling behaviour was largely motivated by financial benefits. Material recovery facilities provided by the government appeared to be inadequate. For other private-sector participants (scrap dealers, re-processor and moulders), they lacked investment in equipments for sorting and storage of plastics waste. We further explain the roles of social norms, ability to recycle, opportunity to recycle and motivation (awareness or monetary) and extend Thøgersen's model to include not just households but also scrap dealers, re-processors and moulders. The developed measurement instrument is useful to study other recycling supply chains.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that economic disincentives discourage household participation in waste sorting, yet the Bangkok study found that economic incentives were not significant. Moreover, the claim asserts that lack of information and poor recycling facility conditions have little to no impact on recycling behavior, while the Bangkok study showed that both the adequacy of information and the condition of recycling facilities directly influenced recycling behavior. Although the second reference presents additional perspectives, it does not support the claim’s assertions. Thus, the reference contradicts the claim.

In this study, we introduce a method to automatically synthesize labeled person images and adopt them to increase the sample number per identity for person re-identification datasets. To be specific, we use block rectangles to randomly occlude pedestrian images. Then, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model is proposed to use paired occluded and original images to synthesize the de-occluded images that are similar but not identical to the original image. Afterward, we annotate the de-occluded images with the same labels of their corresponding raw images and use them to augment the number of samples per identity.

i_238,Contradiction,Types of Attacks: Poisoning Attacks: Involve injecting false information into the network to disrupt the controller's operations .,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides significant flexibility when it comes to complex network management. This makes this technology an ideal candidate for dealing with network management issues in satellite and terrestrial networks.One key innovation of SDN is the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This results in a new network element: the controller. Given the importance of the role of the logically centralised (physically distributed) controller, it becomes an important point to protect in the new SDN paradigm. It could be vulnerable to attacks that are common in traditional networks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we address a type of attack that could threaten the operation of SDN-based environments: poisoning attacks.To perform its function, the logically centralised controller must have an accurate view of the network state. The accuracy of this view is crucial to the operation of the network. This view is obtained by exchanging information among controllers and between controllers and network elements. Such information flow could be vulnerable to different types of poisoning attacks. The motivation for writing this paper is that (1) poisoning attacks on SDN networks could have great impact, (2) most of them are relatively recent and (3) the differences between such attacks could be subtle. Therefore, we address the issues by classifying poisoning attacks in SDN. We classify both attacks and defences. For attacks we make a distinction between direct poisoning attacks and attacks that are designed to evade a specific defence.",Missing information,"justification: The reference describes poisoning attacks as a significant vulnerability of the SDN controller’s operation, arising from the need for an accurate network state that is obtained through information exchanges. Although the reference does not specifically phrase the attack as “injecting false information,” the concept of poisoning the network state implies that attackers manipulate (or inject) inaccurate or false data to disrupt the controller’s operation. This aligns with the claim’s explanation of poisoning attacks.

s_1925,Entailment,"Comparison of Disturbance Patterns: Key Differences: Disturbance Type and Impact: While both forest types experience wind and insect disturbances, fire plays a more critical role in boreal forests, leading to more severe and widespread impacts compared to temperate forests .","Predicting the effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on forest aboveground biomass is a central task of studies in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The alteration of temperature, precipitation, and disturbance regimes induced by climate warming will affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. Boreal forest is an important forest type in China, the responses of which to climate warming and fire disturbance are increasingly obvious. In this study, we used a forest landscape model LANDIS PRO to simulate the effects of climate change on aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the Great Xing'an Mountains, and compared direct effects of climate warming and the effects of climate warming-induced fires on forest aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass in this area increased under climate warming scenarios and fire disturbance scenarios with increased intensity. Under the current climate and fire regime scenario, the aboveground biomass in this area was (97.14±5.78) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, and the value would increase up to (97.93±5.83) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> under the B1F2 scenario. Under the A2F3 scenario, aboveground biomass at landscape scale was relatively higher at the simulated periods of year 100-150 and year 150-200, and the value were (100.02±3.76) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> and (110.56±4.08) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, the predicted biomass at landscape scale was increased by (0.56±1.45) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>under the CF2 scenario (fire intensity increased by 30%) at some simulated periods, and the aboveground biomass was reduced by (7.39±1.79) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> in CF3 scenario (fire intensity increased by 230%) at the entire simulation period. There were significantly different responses between coniferous and broadleaved species under future climate warming scenarios, in that the simulated biomass for both Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla showed decreasing trend with climate change, whereas the simulated biomass for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, Picea koraiensis and Populus davidiana showed increasing trend at different degrees during the entire simulation period. There was a time lag for the direct effect of climate warming on biomass for coniferous and broadleaved species. The response time of coniferous species to climate warming was 25-30 years, which was longer than that for broadleaf species. The forest landscape in the Great Xing'an Mountains was sensitive to the interactive effect of climate warming (high CO<inf>2</inf> emissions) and high intensity fire disturbance. Future climate warming and high intensity forest fire disturbance would significantly change the composition and structure of forest ecosystem.
[5]: Question: To what extent do small-scale disturbances in the forest canopy, created by natural disturbance agents, affect stand development? Doubts exist as to whether small canopy openings have any real effect on the understory tree recruitment, especially in boreal forests. Location: Conifer and mixed stands in the Gaspesian region in eastern Québec. The main natural disturbance agents are recurring outbreaks of Choristoneura fumiferana (eastern spruce budworm) and winds. Methods: Linear transects in 27 sites were used to describe the gap (< 0.1 ha) regime parameters, including gap fraction, gap size and change in disturbance severity through time. Three stand types were distinguished, based on a gradient of abundance of tree host species for the eastern spruce budworm. The impact of gaps was evaluated on the basis of changes in the number, the period of recruitment, and the composition of tree saplings present within gap areas. Changes were measured along the gap size gradient, and according to the pattern of recent budworm epidemics. Results: The gap fraction is highly variable ( 18%-64%) and is on average relatively high (42%). Gap sizes have a positively skewed distribution. In most cases the growth rate among gap filling saplings increased sufficiently to date disturbance events. The composition and the structure of understory trees were affected by gap formation. The number of shade-intolerant tree species did increase during or following periods of particularly severe canopy disturbances. However, the establishment or survival of shade intolerant species was not restricted to larger gaps or more intensely disturbed periods. Conclusions: In sub-boreal forests of Eastern Canada, small scale disturbances in the tree canopy influence stand regeneration dynamics, but not to the extent that parameters such as sapling composition and recruitment patterns depend on gap regime characteristics. © IAVS; Opulus Press Uppsala.
[6]: The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale. Results from our research provided insight into the future forest management and have implications for improving boreal forest sustainability.",Entailment,"justification: The claim explicitly compares disturbances in two forest types, noting that while both experience wind and insect disturbances, fire is more critical in boreal forests compared to temperate forests. However, the reference provided details effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on boreal or sub-boreal forests and does not include any comparative data or discussion addressing temperate forests. Although there is detailed analysis of fire impacts within boreal forests, there is no information on wind and insect disturbances in temperate forests to support a comparison.

Prevention of Acute Complications: Transfusions are effective in treating acute chest syndrome, a severe complication of thalassemia .","Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.
[2]: The therapeutic management of sickle cell disease is based on several strategies, in which red blood cell transfusion plays an essential role in acute complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome and stroke. However, it is important to weigh the benefit/risk before transfusion in children with sickle cell disease and not to rely solely on the value of hemoglobin. Indeed, it is important to remember that a negative antibody screen as well as a negative serological crossmatch test do not totally eliminate alloimmunisation or the risk of post-transfusion haemolysis. Sickle cell patients demonstrate multiple immuno-haematological features: variant phenotypes (especially in the Rh and MNS systems), rare blood groups, allo- and auto-immunisation favored because of the inflammatory state. The presence of an alloimmunisation can lead to a significant delay to obtain compatible red blood cell units, a supply difficulty or even a genuine blood transfusion deadlock. About 30 % of the requests for rare blood in France concerns sickle cell patients. Any vaso-occlusive crisis occurring within 3 to 15 days after a transfusion should be suspected to be a delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reaction; whenever necessary, the child should be referred to a reference center and any further transfusions should be avoided. The so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome, corresponding to a major delayed haemolysis with concomitant destruction of autologous red blood cells, constitutes a major complication of the transfusion and may be potentially fatal. It is essential to educate patients and physicians on the recognition of the clinical signs of delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reactions, in order to rapidly implement measures to limit their immediate effects and avoid their occurrence in case of future transfusion.",Entity error,"justification: The claim asserts that transfusions are effective in treating acute chest syndrome as an acute complication of thalassemia. However, the reference exclusively discusses the use of transfusions for acute complications—including acute chest syndrome—within the context of sickle cell disease (SCD), not thalassemia. This discrepancy in the underlying condition (thalassemia vs. SCD) means the reference does not support the claim.

s_418,Entailment,"It primarily focuses on transforming unstructured text data into a structured format, which is often assumed to be easily analyzable using statistical, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, despite the inherent complexities involved .","Text mining, also referred to as text data mining, is the process of extracting interesting and non-Trivial patterns or knowledge from text documents. It uses algorithms to transform free flow text (unstructured) into data that can be analyzed (structured) by applying Statistical, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Text mining is an evolving technology that allows enterprises to understand their customers well, and help them in redefining customer needs. As e-commerce is becoming more and more established, the number of customer reviews and feedback that a product receives has grown rapidly over a period of time. For a popular asset, the number of review comments can be in thousands or even more. This makes it difficult for the manufacturer to read all of them to make an informed decision in improving product quality and support. Again it is difficult for the manufacturer to keep track and to manage all customer opinions. This article attempts to derive some meaningful information from asset reviews which will be used in enhancing asset features from engineering point of view and helps in improving the support quality and customer experience.
[2]: Text data, which are represented as free text in World Wide Web (WWW), are inherently unstructured and hence it becomes difficult to directly process the text data by computer programs. There has been great interest in text mining techniques recently for helping users to quickly gain knowledge from the Web. Text mining technologies usually involve tasks such as text refining which transforms free text into an intermediate representation form which is machine-processable and knowledge distillation which deduces patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form. These text representation methodologies consider documents as bags of words and ignore the meanings and ideas their authors want to convey. As terms are treated as individual items in such simplistic representations, terms lose their semantic relations and texts lose their original meanings. In this paper, we propose a system that overcomes the limitations of the existing technologies to retrieve the information from the knowledge discovered through data mining based on the detailed meanings of the text. For this, we propose a Knowledge representation technique, which uses Resources Description Framework (RDF) metadata to represent the semantic relations, which are extracted from textual web document using natural language processing techniques. The main objective of the creation of RDF metadata in this system is to have flexibility for easy retrieval of the semantic information effectively. We also propose an effective SEMantic INformation RETrieval algorithm called SEMINRET algorithm. The experimental results obtained from this system show that the computations of Precision and Recall in RDF databases are highly accurate when compared to XML databases. Moreover, it is observed from our experiments that the document retrieval from the RDF database is more efficient than the document retrieval using XML databases. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that the process focuses on transforming unstructured text into a structured format, which can then be analyzed using statistical, machine learning, and NLP techniques. The reference directly supports this by describing text mining as a process that converts free-flowing (unstructured) text into data that can be analyzed using those same techniques. Thus, the claim is fully supported by the reference.

Data Sources: Eligible trials were identified by a literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Control Trials Register, Google Scholar, and EBSCO on the basis of criteria of acceptable quality and relevance. The search was performed using the following terms: yoga for schizophrenia, yoga for depression, yoga for anxiety, yoga for PTSD, yoga therapy, yoga for psychiatric disorders, complementary treatment, and efficacy of yoga therapy. Trials both unpublished and published with no limitation placed on year of publication were included; however, the oldest article included in the final meta-analysis was published in 2000. Study Selection: All available randomized, controlled trials of yoga for the treatment of mental illness were reviewed, and 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. As very few randomized, controlled studies have examined yoga for mental illness, this meta-analysis includes studies with participants who were diagnosed with mental illness, as well as studies with participants who were not diagnosed with mental illness but reported symptoms of mental illness. Trials were excluded due to the following: (1) insufficient information, (2) inadequate statistical analysis, (3) yoga was not the central component of the intervention, (4) subjects were not diagnosed with or did not report experiencing symptoms of one of the psychiatric disorders of interest (ie, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and PTSD), (5) study was not reported in English, and (6) study did not include a control group. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on participant diagnosis, inclusion criteria, treatment and control groups, duration of intervention, and results (pre-post mean and standard deviations, t values, and f values). Number, age, and sex ratio of participants were also obtained when available. Data Synthesis: The combined analysis of all 10 studies provided a pooled effect size of -3.25 (95% CI, -5.36 to -1.14; P=.002), indicating that yoga-based interventions have a statistically significant effect as an adjunct treatment for major psychiatric disorders. Findings in support of alternative and complementary interventions may especially be an aid in the treatment of disorders for which current treatments are found to be inadequate or to carry severe liabilities. Conclusions: As current psychopharmacologic interventions for severe mental illness are associated with increased risk of weight gain as well as other metabolic side effects that increase patients' risk for cardiovascular disease, yoga may be an effective, far less toxic adjunct treatment option for severe mental illness. © Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc. [12] Introduction: Oxidative stress is associated with aging, which ultimately causes deterioration of muscles. Antioxidant defense system deteriorates while enhancing accumulations of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) due to lipid peroxidation and altered enzyme activities in old age. Regular practice of yoga can maintain the antioxidants level of the body, even in stressful conditions. Aim: The present study was designed to assess the effects of lifestyle technique on oxidative stress and lipid profile in normotensive elderly subjects. Materials and Methods: Seventy four healthy elderly subjects (43 males and 31 females) 60 to 80 years of age were selected from the Santosh Medical College, Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh, India, for three months lifestyle modification program which included morning walk, Nadi shodan pranayama, dietary restrictions and increased intake of water. Blood pressure and oxidative stress markers Glutathione (GSH), Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) were recorded twice, one at baseline and another after three months of lifestyle modifications. Results: Post lifestyle modifications technique values revealed a significant increase in GSH (88.03±9.58 ng/ml vs 93.12±9.17 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) and SOD (78.22±11.97 ng/ml vs 85.22±11.08 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), and a decline in MDA (5.28±0.52 m mol/ml vs 4.48± 0.69 m mol/ml, p < 0.0001) levels. Further, there was significant reduction in the systolic blood pressure (p <0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.0002); besides all fasting lipids decreased significantly except High Density Lipids (HDL). Conclusion: The findings of the present study show that lifestyle modification is helpful in reducing cardiovascular disease risk but also assuring for good health by decreasing oxidative stress level along with lipid profile. Further, all these modifications are easy to follow. However, more studies are required to make a generalized lifestyle modification program in normotensive elderly subjects.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The claim asserts that individuals with chronic diseases are more likely to experience adverse events related to their conditions. However, the provided reference focuses on the efficacy of yoga therapy for treating psychiatric disorders and the effects of lifestyle modifications on oxidative stress and lipid profiles in elderly subjects.

s_1129,Entailment,"Key Functions: Reactivation and Proliferation: Dormant cells can be reactivated. This reactivation involves β1-integrin signaling leading to ERK-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation and actin stress fiber formation, which promotes cell proliferation .","Breast cancer that recurs as metastatic disease many years after primary tumor resection and adjuvant therapy seems to arise from tumor cells that disseminated early in the course of disease but did not develop into clinically apparent lesions. These long-term surviving, disseminated tumor cells maintain a state of dormancy, but may be triggered to proliferate through largely unknown factors. We now show that the induction of fibrosis, associated with deposition of type I collagen (Col-I) in the in vivo metastatic microenvironment, induces dormant D2.0R cells to form proliferative metastatic lesions through β1-integrin signaling. In vitro studies using a three-dimensional culture system modeling dormancy showed that Col-I induces quiescent D2.0R cells to proliferate through β1-integrin activation of SRC and focal adhesion kinase, leading to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase and actin stress fiber formation. Blocking β1-integrin, Src, ERK, or myosin light chain kinase by short hairpin RNA or pharmacologic approaches inhibited Col-I-induced activation of this signaling cascade, cytoskeletal reorganization, and proliferation. These findings show that fibrosis with Col-I enrichment at the metastatic site may be a critical determinant of cytoskeletal reorganization in dormant tumor cells, leading to their transition from dormancy to metastatic growth. Thus, inhibiting Col-I production, its interaction with β1-integrin, and downstream signaling of β1-integrin may be important strategies for preventing or treating recurrent metastatic disease. ©2010 AACR.
[2]: The most frequent site of prostate cancer metastasis is the bone. Adhesion to bone-specific factors may facilitate the selective metastasis of prostate cancer to the skeleton. Therefore, we tested whether prostate cancer bone metastasis is mediated by binding to type I collagen, the most abundant bone protein. We observed that only bone metastatic prostate cancer cells bound collagen I, whereas cells that form only visceral metastases failed to bind collagen. To confirm the relationship between collagen adhesion and bone metastatic potential, a collagen-binding variant of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells was derived through serial passage on type I collagen (LNCaP <inf>col</inf>). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells express increased levels of the integrin collagen I receptor α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> compared with LNCaP cells. Antibodies to the α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> complex inhibited LNCaP<inf>col</inf> binding to collagen, confirming that integrins mediated the attachment. Correspondingly, LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells displayed enhanced chemotactic migration toward collagen I compared with LNCaP cells, an activity that could be blocked with α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> antibodies. To directly test the role of α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf>-dependent collagen binding in bone metastasis, LNCaP and LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice. After 9 weeks, 7 of 13 (53%) mice injected with LNCaP<inf>col</inf> developed bone tumors, whereas 0 of 8 mice injected with LNCaP cells had evidence of boney lesions. LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells were found to express increased levels of the metastasis-promoting RhoC GTPase compared with parental LNCaP.

Use of Hard Coatings: Molybdenum Disulphide (MoS2): This solid lubricant coating is known for its low friction coefficient and wear resistance, making it suitable for long-term lubrication in dry environments .","Tungsten disulphides (WS <inf>2</inf>), which belong to the family of transition metal dichalcogenides, are well known for their solid lubricating behaviour.

Solid lubricant coatings are attractive because they can reduce friction-generated heat. WS <inf>2</inf> is a common solid lubricant. However, the use of WS <inf>2</inf> can limit excessive wear, as well as the friction coefficient. Several studies on solid lubricant coatings demonstrated success in lubricating dry sliding contacts over very long periods in tribometer tests or reciprocating sliding experiments.

There is also recognition of the need for marine spatial planning (MSP) as a process for informing EBM with regard to the allocation and siting of ocean uses so that ecosystem health is ensured and trade-offs between ecosystem services are appropriately dealt with. Marine spatial planning is both an integrated and an area-based process, and this paper produces a spatial characterisation of the BCLME for achieving a common basis for MSP in the region, focusing on the oceanography, biology and fisheries. Recognising spatial variation in physical driving forces, primary and secondary production, trophic structures and species richness, four different subsystems are characterised: (1) north of the Angola–Benguela Front, (2) from the Angola–Benguela Front to Lüderitz, (3) from Lüderitz to Cape Agulhas, and (4) from Cape Agulhas to Port Alfred on the south-east coast of South Africa. Research and monitoring requirements of relevance for MSP and EBM in the region are identified, focusing on understanding variability and change, including with regard to the boundary areas identified for the system. To this end, 14 cross-shelf monitoring transects are proposed (including seven that are already being monitored) to estimate fluxes of biota, energy and materials within and between the subsystems. The usefulness of models for understanding ecosystem variability and changes is recognised and the need for fine-scale resolution of both sampling and modelling for adequate MSP as input to EBM for the often-conflicting interests of conserving biodiversity, and managing fisheries, recreation, offshore oil and gas exploration and exploitation, offshore mining and shipping routes, is emphasised.",Entity error,"justification: The claim comprises two main parts.

[2]: The prevalence of neural tube defects (NTD) in Europe is around 9 per 10,000 births making it one of the most frequent congential anomalies affecting the central nervous system. NTD encompass all anomalies that are secondary to failure of closure of the neural tube. In this review, we will first summarize the embryology and some epidemiologic aspects related to NTDs. The review focuses on myelomeningocele (MMC), which is the most common distal closure defect. We will describe the secondary pathologic changes in the central and peripheral nervous system that appear later on in pregnancy and contribute to the condition's morbidity. The postnatal impact of MMC mainly depends on the upper level of the lesion. In Europe, the vast majority of parents with a fetus with prenatally diagnosed NTDs, including MMC, opt for termination of pregnancy, as they are apparently perceived as very debilitating conditions. Animal experiments have shown that prenatal surgery can reverse this sequence. This paved the way for clinical fetal surgery resulting in an apparent improvement in outcome. The results of a recent randomized trial confirmed better outcomes after fetal repair compared to postnatal repair; with follow up for 30 months. This should prompt fetal medicine specialists to reconsider their position towards this condition as well as its prenatal repair. The fetal surgery centre in Leuven did not have a clinical programme for fetal NTD repair until the publication of the MOMS trial. In order to offer this procedure safely and effectively, we allied to a high volume centre willing to share its expertise and assist us in the first procedures. Given the maternal side effects of current open fetal surgical techniques, we have intensified our research programmes to explore minimally invasive alternatives. Below we will describe how we are implementing this. © Cambridge University Press 2012.
[3]: BACKGROUND: There has been some increase in the proportion of Neural Tube Defects (NTD) admitted in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital recently. Fora largely preventable birth defect, this increase is both unnecessary and unacceptable. This study was undertaken to describe the admission patterns and outcome of neural tube defects in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study of babies with neural tube defects who were admitted into Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital from 1st May 2002 to 30th April 2005 was carried out. Their case notes were retrieved and information on the sex, maternal drugs during pregnancy, type of defect and associated malformations, prenatal diagnosis, management and outcome were obtained. The admission rate and the incidence were then calculated. RESULTS: There were 2891 total admissions (1691 males and 1200 females) during the study period of which 37 (1.3%) were neonates with NTD. Of those with NTD, 25 were males and 12 female giving a male to female ratio of 2:1 (statistically not significant p = 0.242.) The total hospital delivery at the study period was 7,388 of which 7 had NTD giving an incidence of 0.95/1000 deliveries. The commonest type of NTD was myelomeningocoele in 31 (83.8%), and the commonest site was the thoracolumbar region (93.5%). Frontal encephalocoele was seen in 6 (16.2%). All the babies with myelomeningocoele presented with flaccid paraparesis and were incontinent of both urine and faeces. Seventeen of the babies had only spina bifida while 14 had additional defects including talipes equinovarus (8), hydrocephalus (2), frontal encephalocoele (1), and multiple malformations (3). Ten babies (27%) died, three of them after surgery. All the mothers received folic acid from the second trimester of pregnancy, but none did before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The Incidence of NTD is on the increase in our environment. There is need to formulate/implement the policy of preconceptional folic acid therapy for all woman of childbearing age as a preventive measure
[4]: Incidence: Worldwide, the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) varies from 0.17 to 6.39 per 1,000 live births. The declining prevalence of myelomeningocele, the most common NTD, is secondary to several factors including folic acid fortification, prenatal diagnosis with termination of affected fetuses, and unknown factors. Impact of changes: Of those born with myelomeningocele, survival during infancy and preschool years has improved over the last 25 years (Bowman et al., Pediatr Neurosurg 34:114-120, 4). Fewer newborns today require shunt placement, which will hopefully improve the long-term mortality associated with this disease (Chakraborty et al., J Neurosurg Pediatr 1(5):361-365, 13, unpublished data). Of a cohort born in 1975-1979 and treated at a single US institution, 74% have survived into young adulthood.

i_1986,Entailment,Graduated Density Zoning: Implementation: Encourage voluntary land assembly by allowing higher density on larger sites .,"[3] Waterfronts are a critical site for urban redevelopment in the early 21st century. However many waterfront sites have serious environmental problems, especially the management of contaminated stormwater, which contemporary models of waterfront development do little to remedy. Why? While there is a good understanding of techniques that are viable for the remediation of urban stormwater, they are often ignored or treated as a design novelty. The author suggests that the cause is to be found in the way market forces dominate waterfront development models. Contemporary urban theory such as new urbanism is complicit with these forces, advocating an urban planning model with a high FAR (Floor Area Ratio) and large areas of impervious surface. The author proposes the development of an alternative waterfront development strategy using GIS-based mapping. Focusing on how the remediation of urban stormwater could drive the development of a new model of urban development on the waterfront, the author uses GIS mapping to explore the effect of pervious and impervious surfaces on the production of stormwater in an urban catchment. In a similar way GIS mapping is used to simulate different urban densities. A case study project on the Wynyard Quarter, Auckland, New Zealand is used to explore these techniques. The result is the development of a GIS model that models the consequences of increased density on urban stormwater remediation within a catchment. The model helps planners and developers to conceive an environmental sustainable urban waterfront while ensuring an economically viable return. [4] Due to the steady growth of cities and increased sensitivity to climate change, a rethinking of urban planning is required to manage resources efficiently and increase urban quality. Under current conditions, it is important to expand green and open spaces with all their green infrastructure and to optimize land use in terms of quality and quantity. There is a lack of tools for the specific control of urban green infrastructure at plot level. Furthermore, all previous attempts at green space factors (Berlin, Malmö, Seattle, Helsinki, etc.) have primarily focused on ecological factors. Climatic and especially social aspects provided by ecosystem services are largely ignored. It has also been proven that the existing tools do not adequately respond to different building typologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a new calculation method for a Green and Open Space Factor Vienna and to provide greater detail as regards computation, and to compensate for bias in the assessment. The Green and Open Space Factor Vienna considers selected ecosystem services of relevant green and open space elements, comprehensively integrating the ecosystem service approach into urban planning. Applying the new calculation method to the examples shows that this tool is able to capture changes in building mass. If the greening of building sites is relatively equal, the same values can be achieved. If only the building mass and not the proportion of greenery increases, the value of the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna deteriorates. The consideration of climatic, ecological, and above all social aspects in the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna as an urban development index is a promising approach for controlling the supply of green and open spaces, thereby supporting socially sustainable urban development. [13] Norway has more than 100,000 km of coastline and associated shore zone. The shore zone is an attractive area for development and infrastructure on the one hand, and recreation and protection of biological diversity on the other. The Norwegian Planning and Building Act contains a general ban on any building in the area between the ordinary high water mark and up to 100 m inland from the shoreline. Exemptions can be granted, however, by the competent municipality through land planning and individual decisions. The importance attached to leaving the shore zone untouched varies from region to region. There are large geographical differences in terms of biodiversity, cultural heritage, landscape, development, development pressure, migration and depopulation, and commercial activity, as well as public access to the coastal areas and the ocean. Since 2011, the entire Norwegian shore zone became subject to guidelines that regulate a geographical differentiation of management and a more severe protection of central areas. This article analyses key aspects of the Norwegian shore zone regulation.",Entailment,"justification: The claim asserts that implementing graduated density zoning encourages voluntary land assembly by permitting higher density on larger sites.

Using multiple correspondence analysis and 12 questions and observations on water, sanitation, hygiene behaviours, yard cleanliness and animal proximity, we constructed a 'contaminated environment' index as a proxy of faecal-oral transmission exposure. Analysis was performed using a generalised structural equation model (SEM), adjusting for repeat observations and hierarchical data. Results Stunting (< 2 SD height-for-age) prevalence was 29% among 3121 children (median (IQR) age 36 (25-48) months). Environment contamination was widespread, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, and was associated with stunting (prevalence ratio 1.30; p=0.008), controlling for sex, age, survey year, setting, mother's education, father's occupation, household food security and wealth. This association was significant for children of all ages (1-5 years) and settings. Lower contamination and higher food security had effects of comparable magnitude. Conclusions Environment contamination can be at least as influential as nutritional components in the pathway to stunting. There is a rationale for including interventions to reduce environment contamination in stunting prevention programmes.",Entailment,"justification: The reference shows that contaminated environments—with frequent faecal-oral transmission—are associated with stunting, implying that less contamination (a clean environment) is beneficial. Although the reference emphasizes the association between contamination and stunting rather than directly mentioning nutrient absorption, it supports the idea that lower exposure to pathogens (from infrequent faecal-oral transmission) would likely reduce environmental enteropathy and thus stunting. Therefore, the claim’s reasoning is supported by the evidence in the reference.

Improved Clinical Outcomes: Transfusions have been beneficial in managing recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug-resistant stuttering priapism, and they may also enhance overall quality of life for patients with chronic pain conditions related to sickle cell disease .","Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that automated red cell exchange (a form of transfusion) has been beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug-resistant stuttering priapism. It also provides data showing that many patients experienced a clinical response with reduced emergency hospital attendance for pain management, which supports an improvement in the overall quality of life in patients with chronic pain due to sickle cell disease.

It is crucial to design work management processes that support health, ethics, and safety to mitigate the negative effects of AI on the workforce .","[10] Entering the era of sustainable development and artificial intelligence slowly but surely changes the way we understand the world around us. This state of affairs is met with a lack of acceptance, most often resulting from a lack of knowledge in the area of the latest organizational and technical solutions. In connection with these activities, a new concept of ""technological personality"" appeared, which is also known as ""singularity"", meaning a moment in future development (some say that this moment has already occurred) when technical progress becomes so rapid that it is unpredictable. This may happen at the time of the creation of artificial intelligence that surpasses the intellectual capabilities of man. Such a change also entails changes in the form of interdisciplinary science and creates completely new points of reference. Due to the fact that new organizational and management trends appear in the processes of risk and work safety assessment resulting from the implementation of tasks related to occupational safety and health management, including sustainable development and new areas of supporting these tasks by modern information technologies, research activities should be undertaken in the scope of identifying and identifying these trends and ranges. [16] Society 5.0 as ""super-smart society"" is the key element of the Japanese 5th Science and Technology Basic Plan by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation 2016. It became a political highlight of the Japanese government and was taken over 2017 and 2018 as a vision for the Japanese economy and society, to take over the lead ahead of the world to make people's life more comfortable and sustainable. Smart Systems, i.e. largely deployed and interconnected CPS (cyber-physical system and IoT networks) and integrated intelligence and autonomy are considered the drivers of innovation. In all industrial and social areas highly automated or autonomous intelligent systems are taking over tasks and services - and maybe, one day, control of our lives.

Can technology make a society resilient and sustainable? Will the role of humans change in such a society? What are the trade-offs with respect to human rights, self-determination, independence or will ""Big Brother"" control risks become overwhelming? The keynote will address issues that are already evident now and how resilience, sustainability and ethical issues are now discussed in different context - particularly how can a resilient society manage a crisis like the Climate Crises, and Covid-19 - a situation that has revealed vulnerabilities and will hopefully lead to a rethinking of some economic and societal systemic issues.

It can also have social impacts, such as changing the nature of work and raising concerns about data privacy. Additionally, the governance of IoT raises important ethical and regulatory considerations. In order to ensure that the adoption of IoT contributes positively to ESG outcomes, it is important to carefully consider the potential unintended consequences and to develop and deploy the technology in a responsible and sustainable manner. In this paper, we propose a framework based on SAS and Microsoft Azure technologies to acquire real time data from appliances, define a logic block to determine the range of data and devices to be monitored, and trigger real time alarms when needed.

i_903,Unverifiable,Supplier Evaluation: Delivery Performance: Timely delivery of components and services is crucial in the aerospace sector. Purchasers must ensure that suppliers can meet delivery schedules to avoid project delays .,"The aerospace sector has a demand for high-precision and expensive machine tools that are characterized by a high entry threshold, high risks, and a long payback period. To ensure product quality and the reduction of operating costs, it is imperative that manufacturers in this sector develop an appropriate supplier evaluation and management mechanism for machine tools. Therefore, this study presents a new two-stage supplier evaluation model for the aerospace sector. In the first stage, a hierarchical structure that comprises three evaluation criteria and eleven subcriteria is constructed. In the second stage, suppliers are appraised and selected through the analytic hierarchy process. As exemplified by the purchase of high-precision and expensive machine tools by Taiwan's Aero Win Technology Corporation (listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange), this study conducts a feasibility and sensitivity analysis with respect to the supplier evaluation model. The three criteria are ranked in the order of decreasing importance as follows: quality > cost > delivery. The results of this research have useful implications for the evaluation policy of machine tool suppliers in the aerospace sector.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses a supplier evaluation model in the aerospace sector and includes delivery as one of three criteria (with quality and cost ranked higher).

s_1846,Contradiction,"Canopy Architecture: Canopy structure, including leaf area index (LAI), tree density, crown geometry, and canopy volume, is the sole determinant of the spectral reflectance of forests. Variations in these structural parameters alone can lead to drastic changes in the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) .","Bidirectional reflectance signatures of vegetation are strongly shaped by the shadows cast between objects in a scene, such as tree crowns or leaves. Differences in the shape and spatial density of these objects result in distinct bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) in different biomes. We examined how allometry may constrain the variability of canopy architectural parameters in BRDF models, and consequently alter the attribution of variation in the simulated bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Allometry is the covariation between the size or number of organisms and their component parts. To test the importance of realistic variation and covariation of canopy architecture on BRDF, we incorporated the 3-D radiative transfer model DISORD (which uses the geometric optics (GO) model of Li and Strahler) into a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. The MC algorithm generated an ensemble of tree canopies whose parameters fulfilled the allometry of a set of measured forest plots from Russian forest inventory. The role of view geometry was directly considered using perturbations of the parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of the BRF itself, evaluated at different view angles, and the difference in BRF (ΔBRF) as measured at two view angles representing paired satellite observations. The allometrically constrained forest plots had reduced variation in ΔBRF compared to the uncorrelated plots, but the variation of the BRF itself is dramatically increased by allometry. The variation of the BRF is relatively constant among the view angles examined, whereas the variation in ΔBRF increases dramatically with larger phase angles. The BRF was most sensitive to canopy attributes that were important in radiative transfer, such as LAI and stem area index (SAI), but there were also large (∼ 40% of variance) contributions of geometric components such as tree number, crown size, and ground cover. By contrast, sensitivity of ΔBRF was dominated by ground cover, crown size and tree number, which all play a role in the GO calculations. The mix of sensitive parameters was not dramatically different between gymnosperms and angiosperms, nor between allometric and correlated runs. Together these results indicate that forest structure and leaf area could be usefully inverted together using paired observations with different viewing geometries. Ideal pairs of observations are those with large difference in phase angle, and along the gradient of the BRF peak, which most commonly occur with sequential MODIS/Terra overpasses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

[7]: The concept of canopy spectral invariants expresses the observation that simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral reflectance become wavelength independent and determine two canopy structure specific variables - the recollision and escape probabilities. These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale. They are sensitive to important structural features of the canopy such as forest cover, tree density, leaf area index, crown geometry, forest type and stand age. This paper presents the mathematical basis of the concept which is linked to eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the three-dimensional radiative transfer equation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
[8]: The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that canopy structure is the sole determinant of a forest's spectral reflectance, implying that variations in canopy architectural parameters alone are responsible for changes in the BRF. However, the reference shows that while canopy attributes (such as LAI, tree number, and crown geometry) do significantly affect reflectance, other factors—such as ground cover and potentially leaf biochemical properties—also play substantial roles in influencing the BRF. There is an indication that multiple factors contribute to the observed variability rather than canopy attributes operating in isolation. Thus, the reference does not support the claim that canopy structure is the only, or sole, determinant.

Although these approaches contribute to our scientific understanding of species richness and composition patterns, trait-based metrics may be more useful for detecting responses to land-use change. We compared functional diversity of aquatic insect communities along a gradient of agricultural intensification. Our goal was to compare functional redundancy, functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence among natural ponds, and organic and conventional rice fields. We recorded 15606 aquatic insects distributed across 61 genera. The highest functional redundancy and richness were observed in the natural ponds, followed by organic rice fields and conventional ones. The functional composition varied among natural ponds and rice fields, and differed between organic and conventional rice fields. Organic management favoured the establishment of some pond insect traits, such as predatory taxa, in rice agroecosystems. Our analysis suggests that the conversion of ponds to rice fields results in a shift to less specialised aquatic insect communities with altered functional composition groups. Nevertheless, this result should not be seen as a negative reflection on organic rice fields, because organic rice production affords a better compromise between agricultural production and ecosystem function than conventional agriculture.",Entailment,"justification: The reference clearly reports that natural ponds have higher functional richness and redundancy than both organic and conventional rice fields, which supports the first part of the claim. However, the claim generalizes that “all forms of agricultural practices inevitably lead to a decline in functional traits in aquatic communities.” The study only compared aquatic insect communities in natural ponds versus rice fields (organic and conventional), and it described nuanced differences between these agricultural practices (with organic rice fields being a better compromise).

Multiple water application is a technique use to add the required amount of water during irrigation in multiple equal parts a day instead of one complete set (single water application) during the irrigation event. The multiple water application treatments were the day time (DT), day-night time (DNT) and night time (NT) while the single water application treatments were morning time (MT) and evening time (ET). In multiple water irrigation treatments the water was added to the soil into three equal parts. The supplied irrigation water was the same for all treatments and gradually increased with plant age to cover the crop water requirement during the growing season. The results revealed that multiple water application increased tomato yield by 5% over the highest yield of single water application. The DT treatment increased tomato yield by 5% and 15% compared to ET and MT treatments, respectively. For multiple water application, the DT was the best irrigation timing because it increases the tomato yield by 8% and 12% compared to DNT and NT, respectively. ET irrigation was better than MT irrigation for single water application. Multiple water application led to an increased in soil water content compared to single water application. By applying the same amount of water for all treatments, the DT treatment increased water use efficiency by 5-15% compared to ET and MT treatments of single water application.

s_1923,Entailment,"Disturbance Patterns in Boreal Forests: Impact on Ecosystem: Boreal forests show significant resilience to disturbances, with recovery processes influenced by factors such as soil conditions and species composition .","The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale. Results from our research provided insight into the future forest management and have implications for improving boreal forest sustainability.
[7]: Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events.",Entailment,"justification: The claim notes that boreal forests demonstrate significant resilience to disturbances and that their recovery processes are influenced by factors such as soil conditions and species composition. The reference text provides two supportive layers: the simulation study measures ecological resilience (recovery from disturbances) using indicators including species composition (through mid and late-seral species proportions) and, while focusing mainly on factors like climate change and fire disturbance, it indirectly underlines the importance of ecological conditions. Additionally, the [7] part of the reference explicitly discusses how soil conditions affect the function of northern boreal forest species and their adaptive capacity, which connects directly to the claim’s mention of soil conditions. Thus, the reference overall aligns with and directly supports the elements stated in the claim.

This pilot study provides observational data on the efficacy of local treatment of ulcers with a multivalent silver oxide containing ointment. The silver ointment improved microcirculation and the healing rate of all 78 patients that were treated with multivalent silver ointment and closed twice as many ulcers in 4 weeks compared to the control groups (40.7% silver treatment compared to 19.4% for the control). This study demonstrates the feasibility of this type of treatment and provides evidence of efficacy to plan larger randomized controlled studies. The large number of patients that were helped in this study demonstrates the efficacy of multivalent silver oxide topical ointment and its important role in ulcer therapy.",Entity error,"justification: The claim refers to ""honey ointment"" while the reference describes a treatment using a multivalent silver oxide–containing ointment. Although both mention improvements in microcirculation, healing rates, and reductions in ulcer surface area, the active ingredient is different (honey vs. silver oxide).

Behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as wildcats adapted to urban environments, leading to the domesticated cats we know today .","[6] It is clear from his published works that Charles Darwin considered domestication to be very useful in exploring and explaining mechanisms of evolutionary change. Not only did domestication occupy the introductory chapter of On the Origin of Species, but he revisited the topic in a two-volume treatise less than a decade later. In addition to drawing much of his information about heredity from studies of domesticated animals and plants, Darwin saw important parallels between the process of artificial selection by humans and natural selection by the environment. There was resistance to this analogy even among Darwin's contemporary supporters when it was proposed, and there also has been disagreement among historians and philosophers regarding the role that the analogy with artificial selection actually played in the discovery of natural selection. Regardless of these issues, the analogy between artificial and natural selection remains important in both research and education in evolution. In particular, the present article reviews ten lessons about evolution that can be drawn from the modern understanding of domestication and artificial selection. In the process, a basic overview is provided of current approaches and knowledge in this rapidly advancing field.

This period has seen rapid change in attitudes and practices towards companion animals, with notable advances in medical treatment, nutrition, and understanding of non-human animal behavior, as well as re-evaluations of the position of animals within the home. Based upon in-depth interviews with companion animal caretakers and professionals involved in the companion animal industry, we examined these changes in the United Kingdom. Major themes were identified: Humanization, Commercialization, Medicalization, Responsible Companionship, and Alternative Companionship. These changes have had largely positive effects on companion animal health and welfare, but also bring new expectations of the companion relationship, which humans and nonhuman animals may be unable or unwilling to fulfill. While dominant discourses of responsible companionship prevail, the process of change is ongoing and reflects emerging trends in human society towards diversification and alternative lifestyles.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The provided references, especially [6], discuss domestication and Darwin’s views on natural and artificial selection in general but do not specifically mention cats or their domestication process.

Although this study focuses on elderly patients, the findings are relevant for understanding the risks associated with psychotropic drugs in vulnerable populations, such as those in correctional facilities .","Introduction: Polypharmacy, together with its associated risks for those concerned is a known phenomenon in older patients. Furthermore, it is currently under discussion that the use of psychotropic drugs in residential nursing homes may significantly contribute to freedom-restraining measures (FRM). In this context an interdisciplinary study was conducted to address questions related to this subject. Methods: The study included all residents of old age and nursing homes who died between 2013 and 2015 and were subsequently the subject of an autopsy at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Munich. None of these cases harbored the suspicion of a drug overdose. Records from the state prosecutor's office for each case as well as the macromorphological findings obtained during the autopsies were considered for data analysis. Urine samples were collected during the postmortem examinations and qualitatively analyzed for the presence of a large number of drugs and drugs of abuse by means of liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The statistics software SPSS (IBM, version 23) was applied for a descriptive analysis of the data obtained. Results: Altogether 98 deceased residents of old age and nursing homes were included in the present study. Data obtained from the screening results of 95 of these cases showed that antipsychotic drugs (47.4%), antidepressants (30.5%), opioid analgesics (28.4%) and hypnotics/sedatives (20.0%) were among the ""top ten"" most frequently detected drug classes. The results showed that several deceased from the investigated group simultaneously received a combination of centrally active drugs. So-called PRISCUS substances could be detected in 25% of cases. Discussion: The results obtained during this study provide initial data on the spectrum of drugs that could be detected in deceased residents of old age and nursing homes. The number of substances detected is comparable to the prescription data obtained from health insurances. This retrospective study showed that older individuals simultaneously received a high number of centrally active prescription drugs. This poses an increased risk for both drug interactions and side effects, particularly for this vulnerable patient group. The combinations of drugs detected in the deceased persons in some cases did not appear to correspond to the guidelines of specialist societies. There were indications for the simultaneous prescription of several opioid analgesics or hypnotic drugs. The prescription rate for PRISCUS drugs in the study collective was twice as high as the general German population of the same age living in their own home. Future studies with toxicological results obtained from blood and hair samples from the investigated group as well as the analysis of the available drug regimens are envisaged and will be published at a later stage.",Entailment,"justification: The reference clearly outlines that polypharmacy, especially with centrally active drugs like antipsychotics and antidepressants, poses increased risks of drug interactions and side effects in elderly nursing home residents.

Results show that plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterols became lesser, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol became higher in LA-supplemented groups compared to the control. In addition, a significant reduction occurred in the liver and egg yolk cholesterol by LA supplementation. Moreover, the immunological parameters including antibody titer against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-wattle swelling test, and T-& B-lymphocyte proliferation were enhanced in laying hens supplemented with LA compared to the control hens.

The effects of such exposure are poorly understood. RESULTS: Starch granule size was increased by 5 days' short-term heat stress (35.0 °C) and the increase was higher when the stress was introduced early. Heat stress increased the iodine binding capacity of starches and no difference was observed among the three stages.

OpenPose is utilized as the human pose estimation module to obtain two-dimensional joint point data of the human body. According to the condition of missing data, it can judge whether the human body is in the occlusion state. For non-occlusion cases, a classifier is formulated by the bidirectional LSTM, and the initial two-dimensional joint point information is sent to the classifier for human pose recognition. For the occlusion state, the depth camera internal parameters are used for 3D mapping. The torso vector and joint angle are constructed. The aforementioned high-dimension features are processed using principal component analysis and sent to the classifier for human pose recognition. The KTH dataset and a laboratory dataset containing five human poses are utilized to evaluate the proposed method.

Under occlusion conditions, the accuracy rate is improved by 5.6% compared to the traditional model. Human pose recognition in complex environments is achieved.
[3]: Abstract: Human pose estimation (PE, tracking body pose on-the-go) is a computer vision-based technology that identifies and controls specific points on the human body. These points represent our joints and special points over the body determining the sizes, distances, angle of flexion, and type of the motion. Knowing this in a specific exercise is the basis of work for rehabilitation and physiotherapy, fitness and self-coaching, augmented reality, animation and gaming, robot management, surveillance and human activity analysis. Implementing such capabilities may use special suits or sensor arrays to achieve the best result, but massive use of PE is related to devices that many users own: namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds. The body pose estimation system starts with capturing the initial data. In dealing with motion detection, it is necessary to analyze a sequence of images rather than a still photo. Different software modules are responsible for tracking 2D key points, creating a body representation, and converting it into a 3D space. Action recognition on the other hand is a way to analyze the sequence of estimated pose data with the aim to categorize sequence under the classes. It is widely used various fields. One of the widely known use cases is analysis and detection of potential attacks of illegal action using video from the surveillance cameras. Another use case involves analysis of the sequence of pose with the aim of creating a virtual coaching environment. Specifically, our research will target this challenging issue and aim to create this environment for mobile devices. We will describe some of the solutions that are suitable for effectively pose estimation and action recognition on mobile devices.

However, the risks associated with transfusions, such as iron overload and alloimmunization, require careful management and ongoing research to optimize treatment protocols .","Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.
[2]: The therapeutic management of sickle cell disease is based on several strategies, in which red blood cell transfusion plays an essential role in acute complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome and stroke. However, it is important to weigh the benefit/risk before transfusion in children with sickle cell disease and not to rely solely on the value of hemoglobin. Indeed, it is important to remember that a negative antibody screen as well as a negative serological crossmatch test do not totally eliminate alloimmunisation or the risk of post-transfusion haemolysis. Sickle cell patients demonstrate multiple immuno-haematological features: variant phenotypes (especially in the Rh and MNS systems), rare blood groups, allo- and auto-immunisation favored because of the inflammatory state. The presence of an alloimmunisation can lead to a significant delay to obtain compatible red blood cell units, a supply difficulty or even a genuine blood transfusion deadlock. About 30 % of the requests for rare blood in France concerns sickle cell patients. Any vaso-occlusive crisis occurring within 3 to 15 days after a transfusion should be suspected to be a delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reaction; whenever necessary, the child should be referred to a reference center and any further transfusions should be avoided. The so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome, corresponding to a major delayed haemolysis with concomitant destruction of autologous red blood cells, constitutes a major complication of the transfusion and may be potentially fatal. It is essential to educate patients and physicians on the recognition of the clinical signs of delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reactions, in order to rapidly implement measures to limit their immediate effects and avoid their occurrence in case of future transfusion.
[3]: Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters.
[9]: Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim refers to thalassemia, discussing how blood transfusions improve patient outcomes in thalassemia while posing risks like iron overload and alloimmunization. However, the reference provided focuses exclusively on sickle cell disease (SCD) and does not mention thalassemia.

i_1792,Unverifiable,Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is not an effective method to assess the economic viability of CE strategies .,"Increasing interests of circular economy (CE) principles applied into construction projects has led to the development of assessment methods for their justification. The use of smaller quantities of construction materials, materials of higher quality and durability, and recycling of construction waste are all requirements of today's aspiration for a circular economy, but it is necessary to assess their environmental and economic sustainability. This paper presents a review of the current assessment tools of circular economy projects applied to the construction industry, such as LCA, LCC and CBA. The main objectives of this study were to provide a categorization of CE concepts applied in the construction industry (CI) and to review assessment methods used for evaluating CE projects in CI. This paper selected and reviewed 96 published papers and classified them into one of five aspects of CE highlighted in this study: waste management, reducing the impact on the environment, material & product design, building design, and other. The results showed that the use of assessment methods in CE projects has increased in the recent years as well that an LCA was by far the most used assessment method and waste management the most common aspect of CE in CI.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference only discusses the application of various assessment tools for circular economy projects, including CBA, but it does not provide any evaluation or judgment regarding the effectiveness of CBA. Since the reference does not address whether CBA is effective or ineffective, it does not support the claim that ""CBA is not an effective method"" for assessing economic viability; therefore, the claim is not verified by the reference.

s_1099,Contradiction,"Traditional methods like active contours and deformable models are largely ineffective in addressing these issues, as they fail to produce satisfactory results in most cases .","Segmentation of ultrasound images is a challenging task due to the lower contrast and the speckle noise. Active contour is one of the most widely used techniques for ultrasound image segmentation. This method has drawbacks such as the predefined initial curve position and the number of contour points to be considered. A new active contour segmentation for extracting the intima media layer and plaque in the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) ultrasound images is presented in this paper. This paper has proposed a fuzzy weighted graph based active contour segmentation technique to overcome all these drawbacks. The proposed method is used for segmenting Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) and plaque in common carotid artery B-mode ultrasound images to assess the risk of stroke in the human subject under investigation. Using canny edge detection and connected component analysis methods, the initial contour was determined and applied as input to the proposed active contour segmentation algorithm. The proposed algorithm was compared with five conventional methods. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has produced better results than traditional methods. The overall probability of error achieved by the proposed algorithm was 5.28%, which was very less compared to other conventional methods.
[5]: This paper presents a new deformable model based on level sets for medical image segmentation which plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis. The current popular Image segmentation deformable models such as Snakes, Geometric Active Contours, Gradient Vector Flow, Level sets and Variational Level sets have a limitation that the convergence of the contour towards the object boundary is slow and hence not suitable for real time medical diagnosis. To counter this limitation we present an improved image segmentation algorithm which is computationally efficient and also the proximity of the contour towards the object is higher compared to existing algorithms. A new speed term is introduced in the evolution step of variational level set in order to speed up the convergence process. The variational level sets in images with intensity inhomogeneity, tend to be slower and prone to leakage of contour outside the object boundary. This is due to the selection of gradient information for the termination of convergence process. However, this limitation is overcome in the proposed algorithm by modifying the edge indicator function embedded with the speed term that optimizes the effective distance of the attractive force. Experimental results are provided using real time medical images. Comparative tables and graphs highlighting the performance of various deformable models are also presented.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The references acknowledge that traditional methods, including active contours and deformable models, have some limitations—such as reliance on predefined conditions, slow convergence, or issues with leakage. However, neither reference claims that these methods are “largely ineffective” or fail to produce “satisfactory results in most cases.” In fact, the active contour is described as one of the most widely used techniques, and the deformable models, while imperfect, are still actively used with only certain drawbacks noted. Thus, the claim overstates the ineffectiveness of these methods relative to the information provided.

i_2210,Unverifiable,"Advantages of Sponges in Benthic Ecosystems: Filter Feeding and Water Quality. As active suspension feeders, sponges filter large volumes of water, removing picoplankton and other particles, which helps maintain water quality and clarity .","Benthic-pelagic coupling and the role of bottom-up versus top-down processes are recognized as having a major impact on the structure of marine communities. While the roles of bottom-up processes are better appreciated they are still viewed as principally affecting the outcome of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important members of the benthic community and provide a critically important functional linkage between water-column productivity and the benthos. As active suspension feeders sponges utilize the abundant autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in the water column. As a result sponges across the Caribbean basin exhibit a consistent and significant pattern of greater biomass, tube extension rate, and species numbers with increasing depth. Likewise, the abundance of their food supply also increases along a depth gradient. Using experimental manipulations it has recently been reported that predation is the primary determinant of sponge community structure. Here we provide data showing that the size and growth of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis are significantly affected by food availability. Sponges increased in size and tube extension rate with increasing depth down to 46 m, while simultaneously exposed to the full range of potential spongivores at all depths. Additionally, we point out important flaws in the experimental design used to demonstrate the role of predation and suggest that a resolution of this important question will require well-controlled, multi-factorial experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of predation and food abundance on the ecology of sponges. © 2013 Lesser, Slattery.
[3]: Sponges, porous filter-feeding organisms consisting of vast canal systems, provide unique substrates for diverse symbiotic organisms. The Spongia (Spongia) sp. massive sponge is obligately inhabited by the host-specific endosymbiotic bivalve Vulsella vulsella, which benefits from this symbiosis by receiving protection from predators. However, whether the host sponge gains any benefit from this association is unclear. Considering that the bivalves exhale filtered water into the sponge body rather than the ambient environment, the sponge is hypothesized to utilize water exhaled by the bivalves to circulate water around its body more efficiently. We tested this hypothesis by observing the sponge aquiferous structure and comparing the pumping rates of sponges and bivalves. Observations of water currents and the sponge aquiferous structure revealed that the sponge had a unique canal system enabling it to inhale water exhaled from bivalves, indicating that the host sponge adapted morphologically to receive water from the bivalves. In addition, the volume of water circulating in the sponge body was dramatically increased by the water exhaled from bivalves. Therefore, this spongebivalve association can be regarded as a novel mutualism in which two filter-feeding symbionts promote mutual filtering rates. This symbiotic association should be called a ""filtering mutualism"".",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes sponges as active suspension feeders that utilize abundant picoplankton (both autotrophic and heterotrophic) from the water column, which aligns with the claim’s assertion that sponges filter large volumes of water and remove particles like picoplankton. Although the reference does not explicitly state that this activity directly maintains water quality and clarity, the role of filter feeding in benthic ecosystems implies a positive impact on water quality. Therefore, the reference provides supportive information for the claim.

In the present study, we investigated the endocrine disruption and impact of MTA on fish reproduction. After a pre-exposure period of 14 days, reproductively mature zebrafish (Danio rerio) (F0) were exposed to MTA at environmental concentrations (33, 100, 333, and 666. ng/L) for 21 days.

The exposure significantly decreased the circulating concentrations of estradiol (E2) and testosterone (T) in female fish or 11-keto testosterone (11-KT) in male fish. MTA exposure significantly downregulated the transcription of certain genes along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis.

We investigated the requirements, in terms of materials selection, for the development of a 3D-printed structural bus able to withstand loads during launch and in-orbit operations, with the objectives to be as light as possible and requiring the least amount of heat for demise during atmospheric re-entry. The selection indicated magnesium alloys as the best candidates to improve the reference material, aluminium 6061 T6, resulting in both mass-reduction and improved demisability. We also analysed how the relative importance of these two objectives can modify the selection of materials: if minimizing the heat to disintegration were valued more highly than lightness, for example, the new best candidates would become tin alloys. Our analysis, furthermore, suggested the importance of Liquid Crystal Polymer as the sole plastic material approaching the performance of the best metal choices.

The experiments were performed at two tunnels: Jânio Quadros (TJQ), where 99 % of the vehicles are LDVs, and RodoAnel Mário Covas (TRA), where up to 30 % of the fleet are HDVs. Fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) samples were collected on quartz filters in May and July 2011 at TJQ and TRA, respectively. The samples were analyzed by thermal-desorption proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (TD-PTR-MS) and by thermal-optical transmittance (TOT). Emission factors (EFs) for organic aerosol (OA) and organic carbon (OC) were calculated for the HDV and the LDV fleet. We found that HDVs emitted more PM<inf>2.5</inf> than LDVs, with OC EFs of 108 and 523 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> burned fuel for LDVs and HDVs, respectively. More than 700 ions were identified by TD-PTR-MS and the EF profiles obtained from HDVs and LDVs exhibited distinct features. Unique organic tracers for gasoline, biodiesel, and tire wear have been tentatively identified. nitrogen-containing compounds contributed around 20 % to the EF values for both types of vehicles, possibly associated with incomplete fuel burning or fast secondary production. Additionally, 70 and 65 % of the emitted mass (i.e. the OA) originates from oxygenated compounds from LDVs and HDVs, respectively. This may be a consequence of the high oxygen content of the fuel. On the other hand, additional oxygenation may occur during fuel combustion. The high fractions of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds show that chemical processing close to the engine/tailpipe region is an important factor influencing primary OA emission.

Resistance to FHB is highly complex and quantitative in nature, and is most often classified as resistance to spikelet infection and resistance to spread of pathogen through the rachis. In the present study, a resistant (CI9831) and a susceptible (H106-371) two-row barley genotypes, with contrasting levels of spikelet resistance to FHB, pathogen or mock-inoculated, were profiled for metabolites based on liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry. The key resistance-related (RR) metabolites belonging to fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified. The free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and palmitic acids were among the highest fold change RR induced (RRI) metabolites. These FFAs are deposited as cutin monomers and oligomers to reinforce the cuticle, which acts as a barrier to pathogen entry. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed higher expressions of KAS2, CYP86A2, CYP89A2, LACS2 and WAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) transcription factor in the pathogen-inoculated resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype. Knockdown of HvWIN1 by virus-induced genes silencing (VIGS) in resistant genotype upon pathogen inoculation increased the disease severity and fungal biomass, and decreased the abundance of FFAs like linoleic and palmitic acids. Notably, the expression of CYP86A2, CYP89A2 and LAC2 genes was also suppressed, proving the link of HvWIN1 in regulating these genes in cuticle biosynthesis as a defense response.
[6]: Head blight of wheat in the United States is caused primarily by the deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing chemotype of Fusarium graminearum. However, the discovery of the nivalenol (NIV) chemotype of F. graminearum in Louisiana and Arkansas necessitates having resistance in wheat to both chemotypes. The objectives of this research were to quantify resistance of selected winter wheat lines to initial infection and pathogen spread within spikes, to determine whether wheat lines selected for resistance to the DON chemotype also have resistance to the NIV chemotype, and to improve the methods for quantifying resistance to initial infection. A susceptible check (Coker 9835) and 15 winter wheat lines, which are adapted to the southeastern United States and possess diverse sources of head blight resistance, were evaluated for head blight resistance in a series of greenhouse and growthchamber experiments. Significant levels of resistance to both initial infection and spread within a spike were found among the lines, and lines with resistance to isolates of the DON chemotype had even higher levels of resistance to isolates of the NIV chemotype. Quantifying resistance to initial infection was improved by standardizing the inoculum and environmental conditions.

Five mechanisms were selected for in-depth analysis using the Biofin methodological approach: ecological fiscal transfer, environmental reserve quotas, payments for environmental services, tourism concessions, and forest concessions. They can reduce the current financial gap for biodiversity conservation in the country. Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately US$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also very high, with estimates from US$ 1 to US$ 20 billion up to 2030. Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties, and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges for large-scale implementation of these instruments.
[4]: Over the past 20 years, payments for ecosystem services (PES) has become increasingly popular as a mechanism to promote environmentally sustainable land-use practices, and a burgeoning literature has been produced on this policy approach. The goal of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review of this literature, and to focus on four major aspects of PES: (1) its efficiency in delivering environmental conservation, (2) its impacts on the well-being of local land users, (3) its interaction with local norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship, and (4) its interplay with broader national policies and socio-economic trends. Two major insights are drawn from this review of the literature. First, the conceptualisation of PES according to the neoclassical economic theory of efficient market transactions and utilitarian human behaviour may be unrealistic and counterproductive. In terms of efficient financial transactions, the physical properties of public ecosystem services obstruct the voluntary establishment of PES schemes by direct beneficiaries, practical constraints exist on the enforcement of outcome-based conditionality, and efficiency goals may need to be partly sacrificed to prevent the exacerbation of social inequalities. In terms of human behaviour, land users' actions are shaped not only by personal utility calculations, but also by intrinsic norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship; the interaction of PES with these intrinsic norms can negatively impact on its local legitimacy and even 'crowd out' existing motivations for the conservation of nature. The second insight is that land users' capacity to shift to sustainable land practices, while influenced by the direct payments, remains strongly determined by broader socio-economic trends and by national strategies for rural development and institutional reform. On the basis of these insights, a flexible, participatory, and integrated conceptualisation of PES that can better account for this range of physical, socio-economic, and normative factors is proposed here as more capable of delivering efficient, equitable, and resilient conservation outcomes.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that PES do not involve direct payments to landowners or managers and that the schemes are misaligned with economic incentives and conservation goals. However, the provided reference discusses PES as one of several financial mechanisms for biodiversity conservation, without stating that the payments are indirect. Moreover, the reference (especially in section [4]) describes PES in its classic form and discusses challenges with the theoretical conceptualization, but it does not support the assertion that PES avoid direct payments. Instead, the reference implies that PES typically involve direct financial transactions (even if the theory is questioned), and it does not claim that such schemes are inherently misaligned with economic incentives and conservation goals. Thus, key aspects of the claim are not supported by the reference.

For example, a model combining these parameters achieved up to 90% accuracy in distinguishing good from bad outcomes .","OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to test whether multimodal magnetic resonance imaging can provide a reliable outcome prediction of the clinical status, focusing on consciousness at 1 year after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). DESIGN: Single center prospective cohort with consecutive inclusions. SETTING: Critical Care Neurosurgical Unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-three TBI patients not responding to simple orders after sedation cessation and 15 healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: A multimodal magnetic resonance imaging combining morphologic sequences, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed 24 ± 11 days after severe TBI. The ability of DTI and MRS to predict 1-year outcome was assessed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Robustness of the classification was tested using a bootstrap procedure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) was computed as the mean of values at discrete brain sites in the infratentorial and supratentorial regions. The N-acetyl aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio was measured in the thalamus, lenticular nucleus, insular cortex, occipital periventricular white matter, and pons. After 1 year, 19 (44%) patients had unfavorable outcomes (death, persistent vegetative state, or minimally conscious state) and 24 (56%) favorable outcomes (normal consciousness with or without functional impairments). Analysis of variance was performed to compare FA and NAA/Cr in the two outcome groups and controls. FA and MRS findings showed highly significant differences between the outcome groups, with significant variables by LDA being supratentorial FA, NAA/Cr (pons), NAA/Cr (thalamus), NAA/Cr (insula), and infratentorial FA. LDA of combined FA and MRS data clearly separated the unfavorable outcome, favorable outcome, and control groups, with no overlap. Unfavorable outcome was predicted with up to 86% sensitivity and 97% specificity; these values were better than those obtained with DTI or MRS alone. CONCLUSION: FA and NAA/Cr hold potential as quantitative outcome-prediction tools at the subacute phase of TBI. © 2009 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
[6]: Objective To understand how, biologically, the acute event of traumatic brain injury gives rise to a long-term disease, we address the relationship between evolving cortical and subcortical brain damage and measures of functional outcome and cognitive functioning at 6 months after injury.MethodsFor this longitudinal analysis, clinical and MRI data were collected in a tertiary neurointensive care setting in a continuous sample of 157 patients surviving moderate to severe traumatic brain injury between 2000 and 2018. For each patient, we collected T1- and T2-weighted MRI data acutely and at the 6-month follow-up, as well as acute measures of injury severity (Glasgow Coma Scale), follow-up measures of functional impairment (Glasgow Outcome Scale-extended), and, in a subset of patients, neuropsychological measures of attention, executive functions, and episodic memory.ResultsIn the final cohort of 113 subcortical and 92 cortical datasets that survived (blind) quality control, extensive atrophy was observed over the first 6 months after injury across the brain. However, only atrophy within subcortical regions, particularly in the left thalamus, was associated with functional outcome and neuropsychological measures of attention, executive functions, and episodic memory. Furthermore, when brought together in an analytical model, longitudinal brain measurements could distinguish good from bad outcome with 90% accuracy, whereas acute brain and clinical measurements alone could achieve only 20% accuracy.ConclusionDespite great injury heterogeneity, secondary thalamic pathology is a measurable minimum common denominator mechanism directly relating biology to clinical measures of outcome and cognitive functioning, potentially linking the acute event and the longer-term disease of traumatic brain injury.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that combining imaging biomarkers (FA from DTI and NAA/Cr from MRS) with clinical data (e.g., GCS scores, functional measures) has been shown to enhance predictive accuracy, with one model achieving up to 90% accuracy in distinguishing good from bad outcomes. In contrast, the provided references detail two studies. The first study describes using DTI and MRS (i.e., imaging biomarkers only) to predict outcome—with measures like sensitivity and specificity reported—but does not mention added clinical data. The second study reports that when longitudinal brain (imaging) measurements are integrated in an analytical model, good versus bad outcomes can be distinguished with 90% accuracy; however, the clinical variables (such as acute measures) on their own yielded much poorer performance, and the 90% figure is tied to the imaging data rather than a combined imaging-and-clinical approach. Thus, the claim explicitly mentions combining imaging with clinical data to boost accuracy, whereas the reference supports a high accuracy only in the context of imaging data (or imaging plus longitudinal changes) and indicates that adding acute clinical measures did not yield the same result. Because the reference does not directly support the inclusion of clinical data as described in the claim, there isn’t definitive evidence to confirm the claim’s exact formulation.

Technological and Agricultural Innovations: Improved Crop Varieties: Developing and adopting high-performing crop varieties that are resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses can significantly enhance productivity, suggesting that molecular plant breeding alone is sufficient to improve yield potential and stability without considering other management practices .","The balance between the supply and demand of the major food crops is fragile, fueling concerns for long-term global food security. The rising population, increasing wealth and a proliferation of non-food uses (e.g. bioenergy) has led to growing demands on agriculture, while increased production is limited by greater urbanization, and the degradation of land. Furthermore, global climate change with increasing temperatures and lower, more erratic rainfall is projected to decrease agricultural yields. There is a predicted need to increase food production by at least 70% by 2050 and therefore an urgent need to develop novel and integrated approaches, incorporating high-throughput phenotyping that will both increase production per unit area and simultaneously improve the resource use efficiency of crops. Yield potential, yield stability, nutrient and water use are all complex multigenic traits and while there is genetic variability, their complexity makes such traits difficult to breed for directly. Nevertheless molecular plant breeding has the potential to deliver substantial improvements, once the component traits and the genes underlying these traits have been identified. In addition, interactions between the individual traits must also be taken into account, a demand that is difficult to fulfill with traditional screening approaches. Identified traits will be incorporated into new cultivars using conventional or biotechnological tools. In order to better understand the relationship between genotype, component traits, and environment over time, a multidisciplinary approach must be adopted to both understand the underlying processes and identify candidate genes, QTLs and traits that can be used to develop improved crops. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[3]: Intensification in rice crop production is generally understood as requiring increased use of material inputs: water, inorganic fertilizers, and agrochemicals. However, this is not the only kind of intensification available. More productive crop phenotypes, with traits such as more resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and shorter crop cycles, are possible through modifications in the management of rice plants, soil, water, and nutrients, reducing rather than increasing material inputs. Greater factor productivity can be achieved through the application of new knowledge and more skill, and (initially) more labor, as seen from the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), whose practices are used in various combinations by as many as 10 million farmers on about 4 million hectares in over 50 countries. The highest yields achieved with these management methods have come from hybrids and improved rice varieties, confirming the importance of making genetic improvements. However, unimproved varieties are also responsive to these changes, which induce better growth and functioning of rice root systems and more abundance, diversity, and activity of beneficial soil organisms. Some of these organisms as symbiotic endophytes can affect and enhance the expression of rice plants' genetic potential as well as their phenotypic resilience to multiple stresses, including those of climate change. SRI experience and data suggest that decades of plant breeding have been selecting for the best crop genetic endowments under suboptimal growing conditions, with crowding of plants that impedes their photosynthesis and growth, flooding of rice paddies that causes roots to degenerate and forgoes benefits derived from aerobic soil organisms, and overuse of agrochemicals that adversely affect these organisms as well as soil and human health. This review paper reports evidence from research in India and Indonesia that changes in crop and water management can improve the expression of rice plants' genetic potential, thereby creating more productive and robust phenotypes from given rice genotypes. Data indicate that increased plant density does not necessarily enhance crop yield potential, as classical breeding methods suggest. Developing cultivars that can achieve their higher productivity under a wide range of plant densities—breeding for density-neutral cultivars using alternative selection strategies—will enable more effective exploitation of available crop growth resources. Density-neutral cultivars that achieve high productivity under ample environmental growth resources can also achieve optimal productivity under limited resources, where lower densities can avert crop failure due to overcrowding. This will become more important to the extent that climatic and other factors become more adverse to crop production. Focusing more on which management practices can evoke the most productive and robust phenotypes from given genotypes is important for rice breeding and improvement programs since it is phenotypes that feed our human populations.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that molecular plant breeding by itself is sufficient to improve yield potential and stability, implying that no other management practices are necessary. However, the reference explicitly discusses the complexity of traits like yield potential and stability, emphasizing that they are multigenic and that a multidisciplinary, integrated approach (incorporating both genetic improvement and refined management practices) is required. The reference does acknowledge the potential of molecular plant breeding but underlines the necessity to consider management practices and environmental interactions, directly contradicting the sufficiency implied in the claim.

However there is no consensus in the literature on the occurrence and extent of impact and limited research has examined the effects on aquatic biota in the humid temperate environment examined in the present study. Furthermore, this is one of the first times that research consider the potential for cattle access impacts in streams of varying water quality in Northern Europe. We investigated the effects of cattle access on macroinvertebrate communities and deposited fine sediment levels, in four rivers of high/good and four rivers of moderate water quality status which drain, low gradient, calcareous grassland catchments in Ireland. We assessed the temporal variability in macroinvertebrates communities across two seasons, spring and autumn. Site specific impacts were evident which appeared to be influenced by water quality status and season. All four high/good water status rivers revealed significant downstream changes in community structure and at least two univariate metrics (total richness and EPT richness together with taxon, E and EPT abundance). Two of the four moderate water status rivers showed significant changes in community structure, abundance and richness metrics and functional feeding groups driven in the main by downstream increases in collectors/gatherers, shredders and burrowing taxa. These two moderate water status rivers had high or prolonged livestock activity. In view of these findings, the potential for some of these sites to achieve at least high/good water quality status, as set out in the EU Water Framework Directive, may be compromised. The results presented highlight the need for additional research to further define the site specific factors and livestock management practices, under different discharge conditions, that increase the risk of impact on aquatic ecology due to these cattle-river interactions.",Entailment,"justification: The reference supports that cattle access can lead to increased fine sediment deposition and subsequently influence aquatic communities, implying a potential for degraded water quality. However, the claim also mentions nutrient loading and a reduction in the availability of clean water for downstream users, neither of which is explicitly addressed in the reference. Since the reference does not provide information on nutrient loading or downstream clean water availability, the information is insufficient to fully verify the claim.

s_1048,Contradiction,- **BRCA1**: Involved in the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) .,"Ovarian cancer is a type of gynecological cancer with the highest mortality rate worldwide. Due to a lack of effective screening methods, most cases are diagnosed at later stages where the survival rates are poor. Thus, it is termed a 'silent killer' and is the most lethal of all the malignancies in women. IQ motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the oncogenic functions and mechanisms of IQGAP3 on the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Therefore, the expression levels of IQGAP3 in HGSOC and normal tissue samples were compared, and IQGAP3 knockdown was performed to examine its functional role using various in vitro and in vivo experiments. It was demonstrated that the expression of IQGAP3 was upregulated in HGSOC tissues compared with the healthy tissues; this differential expression was also observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional experimental results suggested that IQGAP3 silencing significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, in vivo experimental findings validated the in vitro results, where the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of IQGAP3-silenced cells were significantly lower in the nude mice compared with the mice implanted with the control cells. Furthermore, knockdown of IQGAP3 resulted in increased apoptosis, and the effects of IQGAP3 expression on various epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were identified, suggesting a possible mechanism associated with the role of IQGAP3 in metastasis. The effect of IQGAP3 silencing on chemosensitivity towards olaparib was also assessed. Collectively, the present results indicated that IQGAP3 is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker, and a putative therapeutic target of HGSOC.",Entity error,"justification: The claim specifically states that BRCA1 is involved in the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer. However, the reference provided only discusses IQGAP3 and its role in the proliferation and metastasis of the same cancer type, without any mention of BRCA1.

Building on economics, strategic management, and information systems research, I suggest that digital platforms make strategic decisions over three distinct types of interrelated boundaries: (1) the scope of the platform firm (what assets are owned, what labor is employed, and what activities are performed by the firm), (2) the configuration and composition of the platform's sides (which distinct groups of customers have access to the platform), and (3) the digital interfaces (that specify the 2-way exchange of data between the platform firm and each of its sides). In this article, I explore the interdependence between these seemingly separate decisions and the role of some important moderating variables.

s_1722,Entailment,Environmental and Social Impacts: Farmers generally perceive wild boars as a threat to their crops and support measures for their control and eradication. This consensus between farmers and wildlife managers can facilitate effective management programs .,"[7] During the last two decades, populations of the wild boar Sus scrofa in Europe have increased considerably and the species has spread into new areas over the entire continent. Because of the animals' impact on agriculture, livestock and biodiversity, and the resulting necessity of realistic management practices, we were interested in the key environmental factors responsible for this remarkable development. The study was based on data from the canton Thurgau, a region in north-eastern Switzerland. We used data on damage and hunting success to calculate a population density index and related it to eight variables describing ecological conditions, demography and hunting pressure (measured by the number of hunters) over a 25-year period. The analysis shows that the population increase correlates with higher than average winter and spring temperatures and improved food supply through more mast years and an increase in the area of maize cultivation. While favourable temperature conditions mainly reduce juvenile mortality, enhanced food availability is likely to boost reproductive success through younger age at first reproduction, larger litter size and earlier onset of oestrus within a season. Given this link between food and reproduction, supplemental feeding, a management practice recommended and very common all over Europe, should be reconsidered. © 2005 The Zoological Society of London. [10] The ecological impacts of feral pigs (Sus scrofa) are of concern in many places around the world. One noticeable impact is soil disturbance, although the causes and consequences are often unclear. We measured the effect of ground disturbance by feral pigs on seedling recruitment and soil ecology over 25 months on a forested riparian terrace at Waitutu, south Fiordland, New Zealand, and assessed the diet of pigs from the area from stomach contents of animals shot by hunters. Foraging by feral pigs for below-ground food disturbed between 7.4% and 12.4% of the soil. Pigs were seven times more likely to redisturb a site than to disturb a new site. Below-ground food items constituted a third of pigs' diet and were dominated by stag beetle larvae. Sites disturbed by feral pigs had shorter seedlings compared with undisturbed sites, but this was due to pigs' choice of sites rather than a consequence of the disturbance. Net temporal changes in density and height of seedlings were similarly slow in both disturbed and undisturbed sites. The basal respiration of microbes in soils recently disturbed by pigs was significantly higher than that for undisturbed soils. There was a suggestion that disturbed soils had higher ratios of fungi to bacteria than undisturbed soils (P = 0.06). This may reflect either disturbance favouring fungi over bacteria or selection of sites with more fungi or more of their main prey, the fungivorous stag beetle Dorcus helmsii. Our results indicate that pigs disturb soil primarily to forage for food and that the consequences of disturbance for seedling regeneration and soil ecology are limited or neutral. The consequences of ground disturbance and predation for populations of animal prey, such as the stag beetles, require further investigation.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that farmers generally perceive wild boars as a threat to their crops and support measures for their control and eradication, and it also mentions a consensus between farmers and wildlife managers that can facilitate management programs. However, the provided reference focuses on the ecological factors contributing to increases in wild boar populations, their impact on agriculture, and the effects of management practices such as supplemental feeding, without providing any specific information about farmers’ perceptions or any agreement with wildlife managers regarding control or eradication measures. Since the key details regarding attitudes or consensus between these groups are missing from the reference, the information provided is insufficient to determine the truth of the claim.

Industrial activities can increase the concentrations of these toxic metals in the soil, water and air where people live, work and play. When exposed to lead, residents face a higher risk of neurological damage, anemia or developmental delays. Urban soil lead levels, for example, are usually higher than the natural background lead levels due to the historical usage of lead paint, leaded gasoline and proximity to industrial activities. We explored a case in southeastern Los Angeles County, where lead contamination in the soil has been a particular concern near a lead-acid battery smelter. In this case study, we investigated soil lead levels across the neighborhoods surrounding the smelter as a mean to support this clean-up decision making. We used a hot spot analysis to identify clusters of high soil lead levels at a neighborhood scale. This case study can be used to teach higher-division undergraduate and graduate students to incorporate spatial thinking and exploratory spatial analysis approaches into the decision-making process for remediation of environmental contamination. Through this case study, the students will develop the knowledge about soil lead contamination and associated health risks, learn how exploratory spatial data analysis can assist examining the distribution of soil lead contamination and discuss potential strategies to improve the environmental remediation process in the urban environment.",Entity error,"justification: The claim asserts that the historical use of leaded gasoline and lead-based paints in urban areas has no significant impact on lead levels in urban soils.

s_1920,Entailment,"Disturbance Patterns in Boreal Forests: Types of Disturbances: Boreal forests are primarily affected by fire, insect outbreaks, and wind. Fire is a dominant disturbance, significantly influencing forest composition and structure .","Predicting the effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on forest aboveground biomass is a central task of studies in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The alteration of temperature, precipitation, and disturbance regimes induced by climate warming will affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. Boreal forest is an important forest type in China, the responses of which to climate warming and fire disturbance are increasingly obvious. In this study, we used a forest landscape model LANDIS PRO to simulate the effects of climate change on aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the Great Xing'an Mountains, and compared direct effects of climate warming and the effects of climate warming-induced fires on forest aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass in this area increased under climate warming scenarios and fire disturbance scenarios with increased intensity. Under the current climate and fire regime scenario, the aboveground biomass in this area was (97.14±5.78) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, and the value would increase up to (97.93±5.83) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> under the B1F2 scenario. Under the A2F3 scenario, aboveground biomass at landscape scale was relatively higher at the simulated periods of year 100-150 and year 150-200, and the value were (100.02±3.76) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> and (110.56±4.08) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, the predicted biomass at landscape scale was increased by (0.56±1.45) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>under the CF2 scenario (fire intensity increased by 30%) at some simulated periods, and the aboveground biomass was reduced by (7.39±1.79) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> in CF3 scenario (fire intensity increased by 230%) at the entire simulation period. There were significantly different responses between coniferous and broadleaved species under future climate warming scenarios, in that the simulated biomass for both Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla showed decreasing trend with climate change, whereas the simulated biomass for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, Picea koraiensis and Populus davidiana showed increasing trend at different degrees during the entire simulation period. There was a time lag for the direct effect of climate warming on biomass for coniferous and broadleaved species. The response time of coniferous species to climate warming was 25-30 years, which was longer than that for broadleaf species. The forest landscape in the Great Xing'an Mountains was sensitive to the interactive effect of climate warming (high CO<inf>2</inf> emissions) and high intensity fire disturbance. Future climate warming and high intensity forest fire disturbance would significantly change the composition and structure of forest ecosystem.
[5]: Question: To what extent do small-scale disturbances in the forest canopy, created by natural disturbance agents, affect stand development? Doubts exist as to whether small canopy openings have any real effect on the understory tree recruitment, especially in boreal forests. Location: Conifer and mixed stands in the Gaspesian region in eastern Québec. The main natural disturbance agents are recurring outbreaks of Choristoneura fumiferana (eastern spruce budworm) and winds. Methods: Linear transects in 27 sites were used to describe the gap (< 0.1 ha) regime parameters, including gap fraction, gap size and change in disturbance severity through time. Three stand types were distinguished, based on a gradient of abundance of tree host species for the eastern spruce budworm. The impact of gaps was evaluated on the basis of changes in the number, the period of recruitment, and the composition of tree saplings present within gap areas. Changes were measured along the gap size gradient, and according to the pattern of recent budworm epidemics. Results: The gap fraction is highly variable ( 18%-64%) and is on average relatively high (42%). Gap sizes have a positively skewed distribution. In most cases the growth rate among gap filling saplings increased sufficiently to date disturbance events. The composition and the structure of understory trees were affected by gap formation. The number of shade-intolerant tree species did increase during or following periods of particularly severe canopy disturbances. However, the establishment or survival of shade intolerant species was not restricted to larger gaps or more intensely disturbed periods. Conclusions: In sub-boreal forests of Eastern Canada, small scale disturbances in the tree canopy influence stand regeneration dynamics, but not to the extent that parameters such as sapling composition and recruitment patterns depend on gap regime characteristics. © IAVS; Opulus Press Uppsala.
[6]: The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale.

The first and third reference sections focus on fire disturbance—its effects on biomass, forest structure, and ecosystem resilience—thereby supporting the assertion regarding fire. Meanwhile, the [5] reference specifically identifies natural disturbance agents in boreal or sub-boreal forests as eastern spruce budworm (an insect outbreak) and winds. Together, these references cover all the stated disturbance agents in the claim and validate that fire is a dominant factor affecting forest composition and structure. Therefore, the reference information collectively directly supports the claim.

Since the introduction of first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1985, many operations for gastrointestinal diseases adopted MIS technique in a relatively short period of time. These MIS operations yielded better outcomes when compared to their open counterparts: less pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and better cosmetics. More complex surgical procedures for benign and malignant diseases of gastrointestinal tract are currently being performed by MIS technique with the improvement in equipment, instrumentation, and surgical skills. At the forefront of MIS, lies robotics. This paper briefly reviews the current status of MIS in the field of gastrointestinal diseases.
[7]: With an annual rate of greater than a quarter of a million hospital admissions and an associated cost of greater than two billion dollars, cholelithiasis and cholecystitis have a tremendous impact on the health care system. Their diagnosis and associated symptoms are one of the most common reasons for clinic visits and the second most common reason for gastrointestinal-related hospital admissions in the United States. Minimally invasive surgery has revolutionized the way these patients are managed. This technique provides a safe and effective therapy that also results in reduced wound-related complications compared with open cholecystectomy. This enhanced recovery has made the laparoscopic cholecystectomy one of the most commonly performed abdominal surgeries in the United States, with more than 500,000 performed each year.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim discusses appendectomy as a common abdominal surgery, particularly emphasizing its laparoscopic approach, effectiveness, and reduced complications.

i_453,Entailment,Concept of Voting Technologies: Voting Technologies refer to the use of various technological means to facilitate the casting and counting of votes in an election. These technologies can range from simple electronic voting machines used at polling stations to complex internet-based voting systems that allow voters to cast their ballots remotely .,"An Internet voting is an electronic voting system that uses electronic ballots to allow voters to transmit their vote to election officials over the Internet. Electronic voting has become a significant research topic in the new century. Many countries use electronic voting devices, but there are still many flaws due to attacks present in the network system or the devices themselves. The aim of a secure voting system over Internet is to provide security attributes to the voting process like authentication and identification of voter, ballot encryption and signing, encrypted ballot transmission over Internet, privacy of the voter, anonymous ballot decryption, and counting of ballots, all in a secure way. A central server model for Internet voting is presented in this paper. With the concept of Public Key Cryptography (PKC), this model satisfies identification and authentication of the voter, confidentiality of the vote, integrity and anonymity of the ballot/vote. The objective of this paper is to present these privacy and security issues for the voter and the vote itself. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Voting by mail is the primary voting method for the State of Oregon, whereas other states only use this method for absentee voting. We believe that it will not be possible to improve voting systems without a complete knowledge of voting requirements.

The preamble is used to signal the network about the UE's intention to connect.,"Random access is the necessary process in the establishment wireless link between the UE and the network, the performance of the random access directly affects the performance the network. According to the analysis of the random access process and the disadvantage of current random access preamble choice and assignment plan of TD-LTE system, this article proposed one kind of preamble assignment algorithm which is based on the users' priority and the user load situation of Base Station. This algorithm increases a preamble part which is based on priority of users, all the preambles are divided into three cases and different cases will trigger according to different user load threshold. This preamble assignment plan compensates the disadvantage of traditional preamble assignment plan; and the simulation result indicates that this algorithm can raise the access success ratio in different situation of user load. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.
[2]: Initial uplink synchronization (IUS) is a random access process in LTE that enables the eNodeB to detect, and uplink synchronize new user equipment. In future networks with huge number of devices, the number of simultaneous IUS users will increase significantly. In addition, it is desirable to serve users moving at high speed. We exploit the structure of the physical random access channel (PRACH) in LTE to reduce the dimension of the underlying data model. This reduction gives a very compact representation of channel impulse response (CIR). We utilize this representation to develop an efficient algorithm which can work in presence of large multiple access interference (MAI) and high carrier frequency offsets (CFO). When compared with the state of the art methods, the proposed method is capable of detecting a significantly higher number of IUS users and can allow high values of CFO. In addition, it produces very reliable estimates of both CIR and CFO of the detected users.

s_1844,Contradiction,"Key Points: Leaf Biochemistry: Leaf pigment content, such as chlorophyll and carotenoids, significantly affects spectral reflectance. For instance, the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) varies with the concentration of xanthophyll cycle pigments, which are universally linked to photosynthetic efficiency and light-use efficiency across all plant species and environments .","Leaf pigment content and spectral reflectance were examined in four conifer species from the Pacific Northwest and Canadian boreal forest. Our goal was to evaluate the causes of within- and between-stand variation in the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), an indicator of xanthophyll cycle activity and carotenoid pigment content that often scales with photosynthetic light-use efficiency. Both the dark-state PRI values and the change in PRI upon dark-light transition (ΔPRI) were measured in situ in leaves from different canopy positions (top vs. bottom) having contrasting light histories (sun vs. shade). PRI varied with species, canopy position, and with the pool sizes of several photoprotective carotenoid pigments (relative to chlorophyll). Upper-canopy leaves had a greater Δ PRI than their shaded counterparts lower in the canopy, reflecting a higher investment of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigments for sun-exposed top-canopy leaves. These results indicate that the relative concentration of different pigment groups and associated PRI responses varied with canopy position and light history over more than one time scale, and included rapidly changing (facultative) and slowly changing (constitutive) components. Most of the PRI variability among the forest trees sampled was due to constitutive pigment pool size variation associated with species and canopy position. We conclude that both facultative and constitutive pigment components should be considered when applying PRI to photosynthetic studies of forest stands with remote sensing. Leaf-level measurements of PRI and ΔPRI provide non-destructive probes of both facultative and constitutive pigment changes within plant canopies that could help interpret variation in PRI signal viewed from remote sensing platforms. © 2012 Science From Israel / LPPltd., Jerusalem.
[2]: The spectral properties of plant leaves reflect the state of their photosynthetic apparatus and the surrounding environment. A well-known mechanism of photosynthetic downregulation, active on the time scale from minutes to hours, is caused by reversible changes in the xanthophyll cycle pigments. These changes affect leaf spectral absorption and are frequently quantified using the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). This index can thus be used to monitor the photosynthetic status of the vegetation canopy, potentially from a large distance, and allows for a global satellite-based monitoring of photosynthesis. Such Earth observation satellites in near-polar orbits usually cover the same geographical location at the same local solar time at regular intervals. To facilitate the interpretation of these instantaneous remote PRI measurements and scale them to longer timescales, we measured the daily course of leaf PRI in two evergreen biomes: European boreal forest and Amazon rainforest. The daily course of PRI was different for the two locations. In Amazon, PRI was driven by incident Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD). In the boreal location, PRI and PPFD were decoupled and PRI indicated downregulation only in the afternoon. This downregulation was confirmed with carbon exchange measurements. The study demonstrates the utility of biome-specific daily PRI curves for scaling instantaneous remote measurements to daily values and comparing data acquired at different times of day.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The core of the claim is that the content of leaf pigments (chlorophyll and carotenoids) significantly affects spectral reflectance and that the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) varies with xanthophyll cycle pigment concentration—a relationship that is closely linked with photosynthetic and light‐use efficiency. The references detail how PRI is an indicator of xanthophyll cycle activity and carotenoid content and discuss its connection with photosynthetic light‐use efficiency. Although the studies focus on particular species and settings (e.g., conifers, boreal forest, Amazon rainforest), the mechanism linking pigment pools to PRI and photosynthetic status is clearly explained. Thus, despite the claim’s broad “universal” phrasing, the information provided in the references directly supports the underlying relationship presented in the claim.

s_1531,Contradiction,"This symbiosis is not important in soils with low phosphate levels, where direct absorption by plant roots is sufficient .","This review highlights the key role that mycorrhizal fungi play in making phosphorus (Pi) more available to plants, including pathways of phosphorus absorption, phosphate transporters and plant-mycorrhizal fungus sym-biosis, especially in conditions where the level of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in the soil is low. Mycorrhizal fungi colonization involves a series of signaling where the plant root exudates strigolactones, while the mycorrhizal fungi release a mixture of chito-oligosaccharides and liposaccharides, that activate the symbiosis process through gene signaling pathways, and contact between the hyphae and the root. Once the symbiosis is established, the extraradical mycelium acts as an extension of the roots and increases the absorption of nutrients, particularly phosphorus by the phosphate transporters. Pi then moves along the hyphae to the plant root/fungus interface. The transfer of Pi occurs in the apoplectic space; in the case of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Pi is discharged from the arbuscular to the plant's root symplasm, in the membrane that surrounds the arbuscule. Pi is then absorbed through the plant periarbuscular membrane by plant phosphate transporters. Furthermore, plants can acquire Pi from soil as a direct absorption pathway. As a result of this review, several genes that codify for high-affinity Pi transporters were identified. In plants, the main family is Pht1 although it is possible to find others such as Pht2, Pht3, Pho1 and Pho2. As in plants, mycorrhizal fungi have genes belonging to the Pht1 sub-family. In arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi we found L1PT1, GiPT, MtPT1, MtPT2, MtPT4, HvPT8, ZmPht1, TaPTH1.2, GmosPT and LYCes. HcPT1, HcPT2 and BePT have been characterized in ectomycorrhizal fungi.

This data can be shared among ships to improve path planning and safety .","Safe marine navigation in the Arctic is becoming more important with a growing interest in the region in recent years. With the summer Arctic sea ice extent having decreased by 50% since 1980, this now opening waterway has given rise to serious interest in commercial activities in the Arctic. There are several navigational challenges that face ships operating in Arctic waters. Sea charts are known to be untrustworthy, navigational equipment can be problematic, and there is the constant danger of multi- year and glacial ice collisions. Here we focus on the threat of ice. Knowledge of its whereabouts is crucial to the safe planning of routes and in the avoidance of sometimes- fatal collisions. With increased traffic and without proper detection systems in place, there is a danger of accidents in the Arctic that may result in loss of life or have severe environmental ramifications. Here we propose a modernized system which offers improvements in the two major components of the current ice mitigation strategy, namely, on the ship-based monitoring side and on the ship-to-ship aiding side. Ship- based monitoring today is a largely manual process which requires a skilled and experienced crew to interpret radar data and scan the area visually to correctly identify dangerous ice. This relies heavily on the use of expert lookouts, as radar is known to fall short of the requirements needed to reliably detect all forms of hazardous ice. Ship-to-ship aiding exists today in the form of organizations such as the North American Ice Service (NAIS) where icebergs and ice conditions are reported in part by passing ships. However, most ice reports are based on visual sightings whose accuracy is likely not high. Here, we propose crowdsourcing ice navigation based on a GNSS data registration system. In this scenario, ice detection and classification is done robustly and automatically based on a redundant multispectral system. This data is then geo-referenced using GNSS, enabling reliable ship-to-ship aiding in systematic way.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder leading to the destruction of pancreatic beta-cells. Type 2 diabetes (T2D), which is much more common, is primarily a problem of progressively impaired glucose regulation due to a combination of dysfunctional pancreatic beta cells and insulin resistance. The purpose of this article is to review the basic science of type 2 diabetes and its complications, and to discuss the most recent treatment guidelines.
[2]: Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a disease characterized by persistent and progressive deterioration of glucose tolerance. Both insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion contribute to development of Type 2 diabetes. However, whilst insulin resistance is fully apparent in the pre-diabetic condition, impairment of insulin secretion worsens over the time, being paralleled by a progressive decline in both pancreatic B-cell function and B-cell mass. Intense research has identified a number of genetic variants that may predispose to impaired B-cell function, but such predisposition can be precipitated and worsened by toxic effects of hyperglycaemia (glucotoxicity) and elevated levels of free fatty acids (lipotoxicity). All these aspects of the pathogenesis of Type 2 diabetes are discussed in this review.

s_1963,Contradiction,"Variable Importance: RF cannot effectively determine the importance of different variables in the prediction process, making it difficult to understand the contribution of each input data type to the model's predictions. This limitation is particularly detrimental in ecological studies, as it fails to identify key environmental factors influencing vegetation presence .","Watershed management decisions need robust methods, which allow an accurate predictive modeling of pollutant occurrences. Random Forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning data driven method that is rarely used in water resources studies, and thus has not been evaluated thoroughly in this field, when compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques key advantages of RF include: its non-parametric nature; high predictive accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. This last characteristic can be used to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to a pollutant.In this paper, the performance of the RF regression for predictive modeling of nitrate pollution is explored, based on intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment of the Vega de Granada aquifer. The applicability of this new machine learning technique is demonstrated in an agriculture-dominated area where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can exceed the trigger value of 50. mg/L, at many locations. A comprehensive GIS database of twenty-four parameters related to intrinsic hydrogeologic proprieties, driving forces, remotely sensed variables and physical-chemical variables measured in ""situ"", were used as inputs to build different predictive models of nitrate pollution. RF measures of importance were also used to define the most significant predictors of nitrate pollution in groundwater, allowing the establishment of the pollution sources (pressures).The potential of RF for generating a vulnerability map to nitrate pollution is assessed considering multiple criteria related to variations in the algorithm parameters and the accuracy of the maps. The performance of the RF is also evaluated in comparison to the logistic regression (LR) method using different efficiency measures to ensure their generalization ability. Prediction results show the ability of RF to build accurate models with strong predictive capabilities. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.
[6]: Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set of 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70% of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65% and 43%, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3 g kg<sup>-1</sup> and 26.6 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.
[8]: Random forest (RF) methodology is a nonparametric methodology for prediction problems. A standard way to use RFs includes generating a global RF to predict all test cases of interest. In this article, we propose growing different RFs specific to different test cases, namely case-specific random forests (CSRFs). In contrast to the bagging procedure in the building of standard RFs, the CSRF algorithm takes weighted bootstrap resamples to create individual trees, where we assign large weights to the training cases in close proximity to the test case of interest a priori. Tuning methods are discussed to avoid overfitting issues. Both simulation and real data examples show that the weighted bootstrap resampling used in CSRF construction can improve predictions for specific cases. We also propose a new case-specific variable importance (CSVI) measure as a way to compare the relative predictor variable importance for predicting a particular case. It is possible that the idea of building a predictor case-specifically can be generalized in other areas.",Entity error,"justification: The claim states that Random Forest (RF) cannot effectively determine the importance of variables, implying that it fails to clarify the individual contribution of input features, especially in ecological contexts. However, the reference explicitly highlights that among RF's key advantages is its ""capability to determine variable importance."" It goes on to explain how RF measures of importance were used to identify significant predictors in nitrate pollution modeling and, in other sections, emphasizes the method’s effectiveness in assigning high importance to vegetation-related variables. This directly contradicts the claim's assertion that RF fails to identify key environmental factors and that its variable importance assessment is ineffective.

i_1980,Entailment,"GIS-Based Mapping for Stormwater Management: Implementation: Use GIS mapping to simulate the effects of different urban densities and the impact of pervious and impervious surfaces on stormwater management, which will undoubtedly solve all environmental issues related to urban waterfronts .","Waterfronts are a critical site for urban redevelopment in the early 21st century. However many waterfront sites have serious environmental problems, especially the management of contaminated stormwater, which contemporary models of waterfront development do little to remedy. Why? While there is a good understanding of techniques that are viable for the remediation of urban stormwater, they are often ignored or treated as a design novelty. The author suggests that the cause is to be found in the way market forces dominate waterfront development models. Contemporary urban theory such as new urbanism is complicit with these forces, advocating an urban planning model with a high FAR (Floor Area Ratio) and large areas of impervious surface. The author proposes the development of an alternative waterfront development strategy using GIS-based mapping. Focusing on how the remediation of urban stormwater could drive the development of a new model of urban development on the waterfront, the author uses GIS mapping to explore the effect of pervious and impervious surfaces on the production of stormwater in an urban catchment. In a similar way GIS mapping is used to simulate different urban densities. A case study project on the Wynyard Quarter, Auckland, New Zealand is used to explore these techniques. The result is the development of a GIS model that models the consequences of increased density on urban stormwater remediation within a catchment. The model helps planners and developers to conceive an environmental sustainable urban waterfront while ensuring an economically viable return.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes using GIS mapping to simulate urban densities and the impact of pervious and impervious surfaces on stormwater production, and it explains that this model aids planners in developing more sustainable urban waterfronts. However, the claim asserts that such GIS mapping will ""undoubtedly solve all environmental issues related to urban waterfronts,"" which is a much broader and definitive guarantee not supported by the reference.

Methods: After IRB approval, we searched our pathology database from January 2013 to January 2017 for patients with positive pleural effusions (PEs). Patients' demographics and clinical histories were noted. Results: 474 patients were identified (288 females [61%] and 186 males [39%]), ranging in age from 19 to 64 years old. Ethnicity was distributed as follows: Caucasian (n = 330, 70%), African American (n = 114, 24%) and Asian (n = 30, 6%). The most common primary sites were the lung (n = 180, 37%), followed by the breast (n = 81, 17%), and the gynecologic system (67, 13%). The lung was the most common primary for all ethnicities (n = 190, 40%). The second-most common primary site was the breast in African Americans and Caucasians and upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract in Asians. In 5 cases (1%), the primary tumor could not be determined. Conclusion: Cytology examination is a useful method to diagnose primary sites of PE. Pulmonary primary is the most common cause of effusion in all ethnicities. In African American and Caucasian patients, the breast was the second-most common site of MPE, while in Asian patients it was the upper GI tract.
[4]: Context.-The incidence and types of malignancies in effusion cytology are largely limited to studies performed in the 1970s through the 1990s. Objective.-To examine how the incidence of different types of malignancies in effusions has changed with time. Design.-A computerized search for fluid cytology from 2000 through 2016 (database included age, gender, cytologic diagnosis, and type of malignancy) was performed, and all cases were reviewed. Results.-Of 30 085 effusion specimens, 3285 (11%) were positive for malignancy (2175 pleural, 955 peritoneal, and 155 pericardial). Of those, 1023 (31%) had known primary sites (648 pleural, 267 peritoneal, and 108 pericardial). Malignancy was more common in females than males in both pleural (15% versus 9%) and peritoneal (14% versus 5%) effusions (P,.001). The most common metastatic tumors in pleural fluid were lung for males and breast for females; in peritoneal fluid, hematolymphoid for males and Müllerian tumors for females; in pericardial fluid, lung for both genders. Among invasive mammary carcinomas, lobular carcinoma tended to metastasize to peritoneal fluid, whereas ductal carcinoma tended to metastasize to pleural fluid (P,.001). Plasma cell neoplasms metastasized to pleural and pericardial but not peritoneal fluid (P ¼.002). Conclusions.-Although pulmonary and Müllerian tumors continue to be the most common origin of metastasis in pleural and peritoneal fluid for males and females, respectively, the frequencies for other malignancies have changed. Familiarity with the more common sites of metastasis in effusion cytology is important, especially in patients with unknown primary, as this will be valuable in judicious triaging of specimens for ancillary studies.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that metastasis to the pleura is particularly common in females and that, among women, breast cancer is the most frequent primary source of metastasis. The second reference provides clear data supporting this by stating that “the most common metastatic tumors in pleural fluid were lung for males and breast for females” and also notes that malignancy was more common in females than in males in pleural effusions.

However, despite the application of the current gold-standard pharmacologic and endoscopic treatment, failure to control bleeding or early rebleed within 5 days still occurs in 15% to 20% of patients with AVB. In case of treatment failure of the acute bleeding episode, if bleeding is mild and the patient is hemodynamically stable, a second endoscopic therapy may be attempted. If this fails, or if bleeding is severe, it is usually controlled temporarily with balloon tamponade until a definitive derivative treatment is applied. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt is highly effective in this situation; however, despite the control of bleeding, a high proportion of these patients die of liver and multiorgan failure. Strategies intended to improve the prognosis of these patients should focus on identifying those high-risk patients in whom standard therapy is likely to fail, and who are therefore candidates for more aggressive therapies early after the development of AVB. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

[2]: Among therapeutic endoscopic options for esophageal varices (EV), endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) has proven more effectiveness and safety compared with endoscopic sclerotherapy and is currently considered as the first choice. In acute EV bleeding, vasoactive therapy (either with terlipressin or somatostatin) prior to endoscopy improves outcomes; moreover, antibiotic prophylaxis has to be generally adopted. Variceal glue injection (cyanoacrylates) seems to be effective in the treatment of esophageal as well as in gastric varices. Prevention of rebleeding can be provided both by EVL alone or combined with non-selective β-blockers. Moreover, EVL can be adopted for primary prophylaxis, with no differences in mortality compared with drugs, in subjects with large varices and unfit for a β-blocker regimen.
[3]: Esophageal variceal bleeding remains the most feared complication of portal hypertension and is associated with a significant mortality; thus, endoscopic screening of these patients is recommended. To date, neither medical nor interventional therapy can prevent the development of varices. However, the risk of variceal bleeding can be reduced using nonselective beta-blockers. Endoscopic prophylaxis is only recommended for patients with large varices that do not tolerate sufficient beta-blocker therapy. Endoscopic variceal ligation in combination with antibiotic prophylaxis as well as vasoactive agents, such as terlipressin, are the treatment of choice in acute variceal hemorrhage. If these measures fail to stop variceal bleeding, alternatives that include local compression of varices using special self-expanding stents or by reducing portal venous pressure with transjugular portosystemic shunts should be evaluated. Secondary prophylaxis consists of endoscopic variceal ligation and medical reduction of portal venous pressure. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference supports the combination of treatments (hemodynamic stabilization, antibiotic prophylaxis, pharmacologic agents, and endoscopic treatment) used in acute variceal bleeding, which aligns with the first part of the claim.

The study aimed to investigate the effect of dietary supplementation with Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract (GUE), Lactobacillus acidophilus (Lac) and their combination (GL) on growth performance and intestinal health in broilers in an 84-day feeding experiment. Supplementary 0.1% GUE and 4.5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/g Lac significantly increased average daily gain (ADG), and GL (0.1% GUE and 4.5×10<sup>7</sup> CFU/g Lac) increased ADG and average daily feed intake (ADFI), and decreased feed conversion rate (FCR) in broilers aged 29 to 84 d and 1 to 84 d. Dietary GUE, Lac and GL increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-PX) activity and decreased Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the jejunum mucosa of broilers, and increased secretory IgA (sIgA) content in broilers at 84 d. Moreover, GUE, Lac and GL increased cecal microbial richness and diversity, and modulated microbial community composition. Both GUE and Lac reduced the harmful bacteria Epsilonbacteraeota, Helicobacter, and H. pullorum at 28 d and Proteobacteria, Escherichia, and E. coli at 84 d, while Lac and GL increased beneficial bacteria Lactobacillus and L. gallinarum at 28 d. Compared with individual supplementation, GL markedly increased the SOD activity and the sIgA content, and reduced Helicobacter and Helicobacter pullorum. In conclusion, GUE and Lactobacillus acidophilus as feed additives benefit growth performance and intestinal health, and their combined use shows an even more positive effect in broilers.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that supplementing with Lactobacillus acidophilus alone significantly increases average daily feed intake (ADFI), average daily gain (ADG), and improves feed conversion rate (FCR) in broilers.

i_961,Entailment,"Integration of Technology: While integrating robots into assembly lines can enhance productivity, it also presents challenges in task distribution and ensuring safety. Effective collaboration between humans and robots requires careful planning and optimization .","[6] Multi-tasking is now ubiquitous component of our lives; despite the fact that we all can cite an incident where multi-tasking put us in a difficult situation. The reason'so many of us do multi-task is that most of the time we are capable of effective dual task performance. Hart and Wickens (2008) have defined the point where one traverses safe and effective multi-tasking to dangerous and ineffective multi-tasking as the ""red-line"" of workload. In this panel, we will discuss this ""red-line"" of workload from the theoretical, em pirical, and practical viewpoints. To that end, we first examine what theories of attention can help guide empiric search for this red line and where these theories must be expanded with further research. The great est need is research that will allow human factors practitioners to identify the red line of workload before a system has been developed. One approach to achieving this research is to leverage the approach of indus trial ergonomics, which has successfully defined physical workload limits by using data from safety inci dents. Another avenue of research to be discussed is that which will lead to refinement of our theories and understanding of cognitive function to improve our ability to predict the red line. Next we move to the problem of evaluating systems to ensure that the red line of workload is not crossed. In particular, we will discuss the possibility of using task analysis, specifically, CPM-GOMS to predict if a system design will lead to excessive workload. Finally, we present two system design strategies for maintaining a cognitive workload that is below the red-line. The first of these is an adaptive automation using eye-tracking to re duce screen clutter when it appears workload has become so high an error may occur. The second design strategy presents four research based design principles for reducing workload to acceptable levels. [14] In this paper we present aspects that should be considered when designing a co-operative robot control for assembling and handling of heavy parts. In cooperative assembly a human operator and a collaborative robot - cobot - share the work place and carry out assembly tasks. A generic assembly model is described for collaborative assembly tasks where two heavy parts are joined together. A cobot control concept was developed with a software architecture considering functional, safety and quality aspects. ©2009 IEEE. [20] Performance of robot-assisted endovascular surgery (ES) remains highly dependent on an individual surgeon's skills, due to common adoption of master-slave robotic structure. Surgeons' skill modeling and unstructured surgical state perception pose prohibitive challenges for an autonomous ES robot. In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based framework is proposed to address these challenges for navigation of an ES robot based on surgeons' skill learning. An operating action probability estimator is proposed by integrating a two-dimensional CNN, with which the features of a surgical state image are extracted and then directly mapped to the action probability. A one-dimensional CNN with multi-input is developed to recognize the guide wire operating force condition. An eye-hand collaborative servoing algorithm is proposed to combine the outputs of these two networks and to control the robot under a closed-loop architecture. A real-world ES robot is employed for data collection and task performance evaluation in laboratory condition. Compared with the state of the art, the CNN-based method shows its capability of adapting to different situations and achieves similar success rate and average operating time. Robotic operation performs similar operating trajectory and maintains similar level of operating force with manual operation. The CNN-based method can be easily extended to many other surgical robots. [Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Entailment,"justification: The claim asserts that integrating robots into assembly lines enhances productivity but also brings challenges in task distribution and safety, necessitating careful planning for human‐robot collaboration. The reference, however, primarily discusses topics like multi-tasking and workload in human factors, along with a section ([14]) that details cooperative robot control for assembling heavy parts with attention to functional, safety, and quality aspects.

Design/methodology/approach: The papers reviewed were selected based on the following key descriptors such as caffeine, sources, trends of consumption, utilization, benefits and adverse effects, regulation and labelling. Findings: There are many physiological effects of caffeine on respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive and central nervous system. It has a positive effect in reducing the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and liver injury and, at the same time, in improving mood, psychomotor performance and immune response. On the other hand, the negative effects of caffeine include addiction, cancer, heart diseases, insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and intoxication. As caffeine, when taken in large amount, is harmful, therefore as per the regulatory bodies, its concentration should not exceed the set limit, and its presence needs to be listed on the label of that particular food product. In a nutshell, it can be said that caffeine acts as a boon as well as bane because it possesses both beneficial and adverse effects. Originality/value: This is a unique and comprehensive review that will provide a brief overview of sources, utilization, healthful as well as harmful effect of caffeine to the readers.",Entailment,"justification: The reference clearly lists insomnia and gastrointestinal disturbances as adverse effects of caffeine, which aligns with two parts of the claim.

i_1760,Contradiction,"Social and Economic Impacts: The success of biodiversity credits is largely guaranteed by their acceptance by local communities and their seamless integration with broader socio-economic policies. While there can be conflicts between conservation goals and local livelihoods, these are often minor and easily managed .","Over the past 20 years, payments for ecosystem services (PES) has become increasingly popular as a mechanism to promote environmentally sustainable land-use practices, and a burgeoning literature has been produced on this policy approach. The goal of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review of this literature, and to focus on four major aspects of PES: (1) its efficiency in delivering environmental conservation, (2) its impacts on the well-being of local land users, (3) its interaction with local norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship, and (4) its interplay with broader national policies and socio-economic trends. Two major insights are drawn from this review of the literature. First, the conceptualisation of PES according to the neoclassical economic theory of efficient market transactions and utilitarian human behaviour may be unrealistic and counterproductive. In terms of efficient financial transactions, the physical properties of public ecosystem services obstruct the voluntary establishment of PES schemes by direct beneficiaries, practical constraints exist on the enforcement of outcome-based conditionality, and efficiency goals may need to be partly sacrificed to prevent the exacerbation of social inequalities. In terms of human behaviour, land users' actions are shaped not only by personal utility calculations, but also by intrinsic norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship; the interaction of PES with these intrinsic norms can negatively impact on its local legitimacy and even 'crowd out' existing motivations for the conservation of nature. The second insight is that land users' capacity to shift to sustainable land practices, while influenced by the direct payments, remains strongly determined by broader socio-economic trends and by national strategies for rural development and institutional reform. On the basis of these insights, a flexible, participatory, and integrated conceptualisation of PES that can better account for this range of physical, socio-economic, and normative factors is proposed here as more capable of delivering efficient, equitable, and resilient conservation outcomes.
[5]: Researchers are documenting a wide diversity of conflicts that emerge among stakeholders about biodiversity conservation (Redpath et al., 2013). This body of evidence challenges the often stated assumption that all biodiversity has positive benefits towards human well-being (Maier, 2013) as different stakeholders may have very different views on the costs and benefits of different situations. The reality is that while much biodiversity conservation (hereafter 'conservation') benefits many humans, there can be real economic or social costs for conservation. The extent to which a given biodiversity component or conservation action represents a service or a disservice can vary with scale. For example, species that represent 'public goods' in general may represent 'public bads' locally (Bostedt, 1999). Large carnivores are a classic example. Because the costs of economic and social conflicts resulting from their presence are felt locally, attitudes to these species are often significantly less positive in the areas where they occur than in distant areas and cities (Karlsson and Sjostrom, 2007; Box 15). However, the opposite situation may also occur. For example, in the harvest of wild ungulate populations the benefits (recreational opportunities, sale of licences and meat) of harvesting a 'public good' often fall to the local landownerwhile the costs (e.g. compensation for forest damage, vehicle collisions and infrastructure to mitigate vehicle collisions) usually fall on society as a whole (Kenward and Putman, 2011; Langbein et al., 2011; Reimoser and Putman, 2011).",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that the success of biodiversity credits is largely guaranteed by their acceptance among local communities with only minor conflicts between conservation goals and local livelihoods. However, the reference discusses a broader PES framework and includes evidence showing that conflicts and economic/social costs can be significant, with stakeholder disagreements and uneven distribution of benefits and costs. The reference does not support the claim's guarantee of success or the notion that conflicts are minor and easily managed.

Studies show that use of micronutrient fortified supplementary foods, especially those containing milk and/or essential fatty acids during pregnancy, increase mean birthweight by around 60-73g. A few studies have also shown that fortified supplementary foods have impacts on increasing birth length and reducing preterm delivery. Fortification levels have ranged generally from 50% to 100% of the recommended nutrient intake (RNI). Iron, zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, vitamins A, D, E, C, B1, B2, B6, and B12, folic acid, niacin and pantothenic acid are important nutrients that have been included in fortified beverages and supplemental foods for pregnant and lactating women. While calcium has been shown to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia and maternal mortality, calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and manganese can have negative impacts on organoleptic properties, so many products tested have not included these nutrients or have done so in a limited way. Fortified food supplements containing milk and essential fatty acids offer benefits to improving maternal status and pregnancy outcome. Fortified beverages containing only multiple micronutrients have been shown to reduce micronutrient deficiencies such as anaemia and iron deficiency. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.
[8]: Pregnancy represents a challenge from a nutritional perspective, because micronutrient intake during the periconceptional period and in pregnancy affects fetal organ development and the mother's health. Inappropriate diet/nutrition in pregnancy can lead to numerous deficiencies including iron deficiency and may impair placental function and play a role in miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. This article reviews the risks associated with nutrient deficiencies in pregnant women and presents an overview of recommendations for dietary supplementation in pregnancy, focusing on oral iron supplementation. Risk factor detection, including dietary patterns and comorbidities, is paramount in optimal pregnancy management. Dietary habits, which can lead to deficiencies (e.g., iron, folate, vitamin D, and calcium) and result in negative health consequences for the mother and fetus/newborn, need to be investigated. Prenatal care should be personalized, accounting for ethnicity, culture, education, information level about pregnancy, and dietary and physical habits. Clinicians should make a plan for appropriate supplementation and prophylaxis/treatment of nutritional and other needs, and consider adequate intake of calcium, iodine, vitamin D, folate, and iron.

i_2246,Unverifiable,"Bird Communities in North America: Grassland specialist birds are declining due to habitat conversion, while generalists are more adaptable .","Habitat specialists are declining worldwide, often paralleling rapid loss of habitat. Grassland habitats across North America are declining precipitously, due in part to intense conversion of grasslands to agriculture and rangelands, and specialist communities reliant upon this landscape are at particular risk of decline and collapse. We explored the relationship between grassland habitat specialism in birds and species population trends using several different grassland specialism indices (GSIs). Our data sources for these indices included (1) a regional bird dataset employing a spatially stratified sampling design (Integrated Monitoring of Bird Conservation Regions) of bird surveys in the Northern Great Plains of North America, and (2) geospatial data of species ranges (BirdLife Int'l) and grassland habitat (CEC North American Land Cover). We found a negative relationship between degree of habitat specialism and species population trends for all specialism metrics. We also found some evidence to support that specialism to grasslands on the wintering grounds partially explains population trends during the breeding season, giving added weight to the consideration of habitat conservation across the full annual cycle of a species to reverse or lessen population decline. Our work is the first to use quantitative methods to confirm the precarious state of grassland specialist songbirds in North America as well as demonstrate multiple methods for quantifying habitat specialism across different types of datasets.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference clearly shows that grassland specialist birds are declining, linking this decline to the rapid loss of grassland habitat due to conversion to agriculture and rangelands.

For instance, higher urbanization levels are associated with increased land surface temperatures and pollution, contributing to health issues such as respiratory diseases and heat-related illnesses .","Quantifying the relationship between urbanization and public health is essential to understanding the impact of the urbanization process on environment and public health. However, there are few data linking features of cities to the public health. We apply a statistical frame to explore the feature of urbanization that affects public and environment health. Then the night light data are adopted to reveal the urbanization process in China from 1992 to 2012. The development of small cities dominated the process of urbanization in China from 1992 to 2002, and large, middle and small cities develop dominantly from 2002 to 2012. There is negative relation between the proportion of night light value above 5 and the birthrate and natural increase rates. The intensity of night light has a positive relation with health index for the elder population (age >60), cancer rate and land surface temperature, but urbanization reduces the positive relation between night light and cancer rate. There is no relation between night light intensity and mortality. The important factors of urbanization affect public health can be considered from social policy (inequality? economy, education, medical resources and insurance system) and the physical environment (air, water, soil, green space, waste, food safety and urban planning).
[2]: The promoting effect of urban planning on public health has attracted attention of western scholars at an early stage. Up to now, a large number of achievements have been accumulated in theory and practice, and the research perspectives and methods are diversified. Based on the Web of Science(WOS), this paper analyzes the literature of public health and urban planning in foreign countries in the past two decades by using CiteSpace knowledge map software, combs the literature publishing trend, publishing source and highly cited literature, and summarizes the research hotspots and evolution trends in this field. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary research on urban planning and public health has developed from slow exploration to rapid development in the past two decades; publications are mainly public health, environmental science, urban and landscape planning journals; it can be seen from the keyword map that the effects of physical activity, built environment and ecological environment on health have always been the focus of attention; the trend of high-frequency words changes from the original built environment to the current multidimensional and multidisciplinary research of ""ecology-society-space-human""; the research content focuses on the three aspects:built environment and physical activity, environmental pollution and public health, social environment and health inequality, with emphasis on multi-disciplinary and micro-scale case studies.

Utilizing anaerobic digestion, CHP systems, and advanced membrane technologies can significantly enhance the plant's sustainability and self-sufficiency. Additionally, innovative design approaches and dynamic modelling can optimize the overall performance and reduce operational costs .","This study discusses efforts being made to realize energy self-sufficiency in a sewage treatment plant, and to achieve both energy conservation with low-load water treatment based on thorough, intensive solid-liquid separation and 'energy production' by using sludge treatment capable of converting recovered biomass into energy with maximum efficiency. Intensive solid-liquid separation resulted in higher suspended solids and Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD) removal rates than those achieved with conventional primary settling tanks. Using thermophilic digestion of raw sludge, recovered by intensive solid-liquid separation, and garbage as substrates, the Volatile Solids (VS) decomposition rate was 70% and generated digestion gas was 759 Nm<sup>3</sup>/t-loaded VS on average under conditions of Hydraulic Retention Time (HRT) 5 days and a VS load of 6.0 kg-VS/m<sup>3</sup>/day. The generated digestion gas was totally used to generate power with phosphoric acid fuel cells.
[2]: Wastewater treatment industry aims to transform from being an energy consumer to an energy producer by recovering energy embedded in wastewater. There are several ways to achieve energy self-sufficiency or energy-positive status in wastewater treatment plants. This paper presents an energy performance analysis of wastewater treatment considering both energy efficiency and energy recovery mechanisms. Various treatment scenarios based on wastewater characteristics, plant capacity, primary treatment efficiency, and supplemental feedstock are considered to evaluate the potential for energy recovery in wastewater treatment. Energy efficiency (process equipment upgrades), carbon capture enhancement through sludge removal in primary treatment unit and biogas production through the addition of supplemental feedstock are considered in the analysis. Codigestion and combined heat and power system integration is considered to enhance biogas production and in turn electricity and heat production from wastewater treatment. Case studies highlighting the progress of codigestion and CHP integration are discussed in detail to understand the impact of various feedstock and technology combinations. The study confirms that carbon capture in the primary treatment unit can contribute to downstream energy conservation as well as enhanced biogas production. The energy recovery potential in wastewater treatment also increased with organic strength of the wastewater and the treatment capacity. Further, the type of CHP unit, number and size are critical factors in optimizing the energy losses in the conversion process. Despite the codigestion challenges and the capital costs required for both CHP and codigestion systems, their integration still leads the way forward for energy-positive and cost-effective wastewater treatment plants.
[3]: The Olburgen sewage treatment plant has been upgraded to improve the effluent quality by implementing a separate and dedicated treatment for industrial (potato) wastewater and reject water. The separate industrial treatment has been realized within a beneficial public-private partnership. The separate treatment of the concentrated flows of industrial wastewater and sludge treatment effluent proved to be more cost-efficient and area and energy efficient than a combined traditional treatment process. The industrial wastewater was first treated in a UASB reactor for biogas production. The UASB reactor effluent was combined with the reject water and treated in a struvite reactor (Phospaq process) followed by a one stage granular sludge nitritation/anammox process. For the first time both reactors where demonstrated on full scale and have been operated stable over a period of 3 years. The recovered struvite has been tested as a suitable substitute for commercial fertilizers. Prolonged exposure of granular anammox biomass to nitrite levels up to 30 mg/l did not result in inhibition of the anammox bacteria in this reactor configuration. The chosen option required a 17 times smaller reactorvolume (20,000m3 less volume) and saves electric power by approximately 1.5GWh per year. © IWA Publishing 2010.
[4]: The application of membrane technologies for wastewater treatment to recover water and nutrients from different types of wastewater can be an effective strategy to mitigate the water shortage and provide resource recovery for sustainable development of industrialisation and urbanisation. Forward osmosis (FO), driven by the osmotic pressure difference between solutions divided by a semi‐permeable membrane, has been recognised as a potential energy‐efficient filtration process with a low tendency for fouling and a strong ability to filtrate highly polluted wastewater. The application of FO for wastewater treatment has received significant attention in research and attracted technological effort in recent years. In this review, we review the state‐of‐theart application of FO technology for sewage concentration and wastewater treatment both as an independent treatment process and in combination with other treatment processes. We also provide an outlook of the future prospects and recommendations for the improvement of membrane performance, fouling control and system optimisation from the perspectives of membrane materials, operating condition optimisation, draw solution selection, and multiple technologies combination.
[5]: A paradigm shift is underway in wastewater treatment from pollution removal to resource or energy recovery. However, conventional activated sludge (CAS) as the core technology of wastewater treatment is confronted with severe challenges on high energy consumption, sludge disposal and inevitable greenhouse gas emission, which are posing a serious impact on the current wastewater industry. It is urgent to find new alternative methods to remedy these defects. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) have flexible metabolic modes and high tolerance, which enhance the removal of nutrients, heavy metals and organic contaminants efficiency in different wastewater. The unique phototrophic growth of PSB breaks the restriction of nutrient metabolism in the CAS system. Recent studies have shown that PSB-based technologies can not only achieve the recovery of nutrient and energy, but also improve the degradation efficiency of refractory substances. If the application parameters can be determined, there will be great prospects and economic effects. This review summarizes the research breakthroughs and application promotion of PSB-based wastewater treatment technology in recent years. Comparing discussed the superiority and inferiority from the perspective of application range, performance differences and recovery possibility. Pathways involved in the nutrient substance and the corresponding influencing parameters are also described in detail. The mode of PSB biodegradation processes presented a promising alternative for new wastewater treatment scheme. In the future, more mechanical and model studies, deterministic operating parameters, revolutionary process design is need for large-scale industrial promotion of PSB-based wastewater treatment.
[6]: This paper presents the outcomes of the first of four phases of a research project which aims to investigate the optimal integration of novel, yet largely already demonstrated technologies, in water recycling process train options. The research project has a particular focus on the minimisation of environmental and economic costs in the implementation and operation of the overall recycling process. In the Phase 1 desktop study, novel carbon and nitrogen removal technologies were selected through multi-criteria analysis and incorporated into two concept stage integrated treatment train options. The first treatment train option includes a main-stream anaerobic membrane bioreactor, followed by soluble methane stripping. Nitrogen removal is then achieved with a nitritation/Anammox moving bed biofilm reactor. The second alternative treatment train utilises a high rate/solids contact activated sludge system, with the separated excess biomass treated in a two-stage highrate anaerobic sludge digester. The digested biosolids stream is treated separately to recover nutrients (as struvite) and to remove nitrogen with a nitritation/Anammox process. Further mainstream nitrogen removal is achieved with a nitrification/denitrification process in a sequencing batch reactor configuration. The two alternative treatment trains were compared to a typical existing treatment train for economics and environmental footprint under Australian conditions at two scales; 10 and 100 ML/d average flow. Engineering analysis included high-level concept design and sizing, estimates of performance, assessment of environmental footprint and whole-of-life cost estimates (including capital and operating expenses). The results of the study indicated that the new treatment trains have the potential to significantly decrease the economic costs of wastewater treatment by between 10 and 46% (based on Net Present Value estimates), and have a lower environmental impact. In Phases 2 and 3, lab-scale and pilot studies are currently underway to further evaluate the performance and confirm the design/operating parameters of the core processes.",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses multiple techniques and strategies that align with the claim’s components.

This approach considers geographical position, technology level, and interaction range .","[9] A number of environmental and sustainability rating systems have been developed and used around the world. This trend has been most notable in the building industry, where evolution of construction practices and concerns about environmental impact have led to the development of different environmental and sustainability assessment approaches, strategies, models, appraisals, and methodologies. The implementation of green technology and practices has brought economic, social, and environmental benefits with respect to improving sustainable development performance with an accompanying certification process. The framework for developing rating systems for building systems can be extended and applied in other industrial contexts. As global demand for energy continues to rise, unconventional petroleum extraction and production of petroleum substitutes are both becoming more necessary. Development and operation of unconventional oil projects can have considerable social, economic, and environmental impacts. For example, one the largest unconventional oil deposits in the world is the Athabasca oil sands in northern Canada. Government policy makers, industrial developers, and other stakeholders generally work together to develop oil sands projects in an environmentally responsible manner; however, the projects lack of an effective sustainable development measurement tool. The WA-PA-SU project sustainability rating system is a proposed framework for measuring - in a consistent manner - the sustainability of development of unconventional petroleum projects in oil sands and heavy oil. The intent of the rating system is to have a tool that can be used by companies, stakeholders, and policy makers to measure and understand the range of impacts that projects may have over time. This assessment framework includes - but is not limited to - regulatory requirements, as well as approaches for measuring sustainability on social, economic, and environmental grounds. This paper presents a brief history of oil sands development, and the structure of the rating system. This structure comprises a description of the different areas included in the rating system, and the rationale for the first tool, which is intended to assist practitioners and stakeholders in general to measure sustainable development of the oil sands and heavy oil projects. © 2012 WIT Press. [13] Sustainability assessments are an increasingly common tool for measuring progress towards sustainable development. Despite their popularity, sustainability assessments and the indicators that compose them are said to have had little impact on the policy arena. In this paper we discuss four attributes that we contend will improve the use of sustainability assessments to guide decision making: non-compartmentalization, site specificity, built-in guidance for target setting, and ability to measure active sustainability. We present a novel assessment tool for wastewater treatment infrastructure that illustrates these attributes. The assessment is composed of two-dimensional indicators we call ""burden to capacity"" ratios, that reveal and quantify the local value of resources embodied in wastewater and treatment byproducts, and the tradeoffs between designing systems for disposal versus reuse. We apply the sustainability assessment framework to an existing treatment plant in Chengdu, China and discuss the results. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [14] Rating systems for sustainability (R.S.), started to be largely used in the assessment of built environment since the early '90s,. The diffusion of these tools led to several benefits but also underlined some critical issues. One of the main hitches is the difficulty in comparing methods and results of different assessments, which have been developed at different times and places, following specific approaches. This paper aims at proposing a method to compare different R.S. and their outcomes, by mapping what and how much they have in common, to identify a shared core of elements that could be considered the most representative in assessing the sustainability of the built environment, focusing particularly on residential buildings. The predictable loss of accuracy due to the reduction of the considered indicators is analyzed, to define an acceptable level of reliability of the resulting concise R.S., whose simplification can, however, help to facilitate its wider application.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim specifically mentions Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodologies used to evaluate cleaner production and sustainability by comparing indicators to target values and taking into account factors such as geographical position, technology level, and interaction range.

i_2198,Unverifiable,"Key Components of Ecosystem-Based Aquaculture: Management and Policy: Sustainable Practices: Promoting sustainable practices such as the use of natural antioxidants in feed, reducing the use of harmful chemicals, and implementing integrated pest management can help mitigate the environmental impacts of aquaculture .","Aquaculture is set to grow amidst threats of new stressors and diseases. The increasing awareness on nutrition and feeding has led a paradigm shift towards therapeutic nutrition, an alternative aquaculture management strategy that can create a balance between productivity and long-term sustainability. The core objective behind this approach was to minimize the impact of stressors via neutralization of free radicals, repair of oxidative damage to biomolecules and membrane systems, immune augmentation and maintenance of normal physiological homoeostasis. The eventual shift of balance between oxidants and antioxidants leads to oxidative stress and subsequently immune suppression, pathological symptoms and slow growth. Therefore, in aquaculture the use of supplemental antioxidants and augmentation of endogenous cellular antioxidants becomes essential. Lipid rancidity is the major concern, which determines feed stability and storage time, besides the cellular antioxidant homoeostasis. As observed, ethoxyquin (EQ), the widely used synthetic antioxidant in animal feed industry, has growing human health hazard concerns. Efficient and cost-effective natural antioxidants are a real need of time. The most diverse marine ecosystem opens a new horizon for extraction and development of natural antioxidants from sea. The antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C, peptides, amino acids, chitooligosaccharide derivatives (COS), astaxanthin, carotenoids, sulphated polysaccharides (SPs), phlorotannins, phenolic compound and flavones had shown a great potential to be used in feed formulation, as an additive for feed quality maintenance and shelf life. Therefore, new industrial perspectives and novel approaches are required for isolation and development of bioactive substances with antioxidative property for cost-effective feed.
[8]: Aquaculture is the keeping, breeding, hatching or culturing of fish. Fish used for aquaculture include nonpearl oysters, mussels, yabbies, marron, crayfish, abalone, prawns, freshwater and marine finfish, trochus and algae for beta carotene (ie any marine organism other than reptiles, birds and mammals). Aquaculture has an important role in the development of many national economies and plays a key role in world development. As the expansion of aquaculture product, there is a growing concern over the impacts of aquaculture on the environmental sustainability and also over the requirements on quality and food safety by consumers and regulators. Global wild fisheries are in decline, with valuable habitat such as estuaries in critical condition. The aquaculture or farming of piscivorous fish, like salmon, does not help the problem because they need to eat products from other fish, such as fish meal and fish oil. Apart from fish and shrimp, some aquaculture undertakings, such as seaweed and filterfeeding bivalve mollusks like oysters, clams, mussels and scallops, are relatively benign and even environmentally restorative. Filter-feeders filter pollutants as well as nutrients from the water, improving water quality. Some profitable aquaculture cooperatives promote sustainable practices. New methods lessen the risk of biological and chemical pollution through minimizing fish stress, fallowing netpens, and applying Integrated Pest Management. Vaccines are being used more and more to reduce antibiotic use for disease control. Onshore recirculating aquaculture systems, facilities using polyculture techniques, and properly sited facilities (e.g. offshore areas with strong currents) are examples of ways to manage negative environmental effects. It is a need to improve aquaculture technology and management system to address the need for eco-friendly production process and food safety concerns in the sustainability of national aquaculture. Fisheries Management should be done for job opportunity, and for fisher, farmer and related community welfare, and also for fisheries resources and environmental sustainability. In addition, it is mentioned also that the product from both capture and aquaculture fisheries should meet quality standard and product safety.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses the use and development of natural antioxidants in feed formulations as well as approaches that reduce harmful chemicals (e.g., minimizing biological and chemical pollution) and mentions Integrated Pest Management as a method to lessen environmental impacts.

Food Safety and Quality: Ensuring food safety is a critical aspect of food technology, which can be fully achieved by merely implementing food safety management tools like risk analysis and monitoring systems, without considering the complexities of food supply chains and emerging threats .","Global food security and safety are threatened by a number of fast-occurring changes, even in the absence of natural disasters or terrorist attacks: overpopulation and urbanisation, environmental pollution, climate changes, intensive animal breeding, international trade and travel, emerging water- and food-borne diseases, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, increasing food costs, complexity of food supply chains, malnutrition and risky food behaviour. Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to ""expect the unexpected"" and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, ""fresher"" quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in -production-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers' ""right to informed choice"" explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various ""-artificial"" food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers' needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), ""naturalness"", respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers' acceptance of innovative food technologies and products.

These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale. They are sensitive to important structural features of the canopy such as forest cover, tree density, leaf area index, crown geometry, forest type and stand age.

[9]: The concept of canopy spectral invariants expresses the observation that simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral reflectances become wavelength independent and determine two canopy structure specific variables - the recollision and escape probabilities. The recollision probability (probability that a photon scattered from a phytoelement will interact within the canopy again) is a measure of the multi-level hierarchical structure in a vegetated pixel and can be obtained from hyperspectral data. The escape probability (probability that a scattered photon will escape the vegetation in a given direction) is sensitive to canopy geometrical properties and can be derived from multi-angle spectral data. The escape and recollision probabilities have the potential to separate forest types based on crown shape and the number of hierarchical levels within the landscape. This paper introduces the concept and demonstrates how this approach can be used to monitor forest structural parameters with multi-angle and hyperspectral data. © 2009 IEEE.",Entailment,"justification: The reference supports that canopy spectral invariants (recollision and escape probabilities) are sensitive to key canopy features and can be used to monitor forest structural parameters. However, the reference does not mention, imply, or provide evidence that these invariants may offer insights into the ecological health of the forest ecosystem over time. Since a significant part of the claim is not directly supported by the reference, the claim is unverifiable.

i_1763,Contradiction,"Global Warming Potential (GWP) is a definitive metric that accurately compares the relative impact of different greenhouse gases (GHGs) on global warming, measuring the exact amount of heat trapped by a specific mass of a gas over a given time period compared to the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO₂) .","Purpose: The common practice of summing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and applying global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO<inf>2</inf> equivalents misrepresents the global warming effects of emissions that occur over a product or system's life cycle at a particular time in the future. The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim states that GWP is a definitive and accurate metric for comparing how different GHGs trap heat relative to CO₂. In contrast, the reference discusses limitations of using GWPs as currently practiced, highlighting that the common method misrepresents global warming effects by not accounting for the timing of emissions. The reference explicitly indicates that current GWP methods distort the actual effects, which implies that GWP is not as definitive and accurate as the claim suggests.

Few studies have examined differences in tobacco treatment response between smokers with and without chronic lower respiratory disease. Objective: We examined the effectiveness of a proactive outreach program for cessation among smokers with and without chronic lower respiratory disease. Methods: Subgroup analysis of the Veterans Victory over Tobacco Study, a pragmatic randomized controlled trial that demonstrated the effectiveness of proactive outreach and the choice of tobacco treatments compared with usual care. Smokers identified via the electronic medical record were proactively offered phone-based counseling and care coordination to receive medication from their Veterans Affairs providers or in-person care. We compared the response among thosewith andwithout an InternationalClassification of Diseases, 9th Revision diagnosis of a chronic lower respiratorydisease (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, asthma). We used stratification by propensity scores to adjust for imbalanced covariates between groups with and without chronic lower respiratory disease within each treatment arm, using complete case analysis accounting for the stratified sampling by site. Results: The study participants were predominantly older, white, male smokers. Overall, 19.6% had chronic lower respiratory disease. A total of 3,307 had outcome data with the following assignments to the intervention: proactive care: n = 1,272 without chronic lower respiratory disease, n = 301 with chronic lower respiratory disease; usual care: n = 1,387 without chronic lower respiratory disease, n = 347 with chronic lower respiratory disease.

UHT milk samples (skim, 1%, 2%, and whole) were analyzed for total nitrogen (Kjeldahl) and fat (Babcock) contents. The coupons were manually soiled with serially diluted milk samples resulting in soils ranging from 0.1 to 428.1 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> for protein and 0.1 to 374.17 μg/cm<sup>2</sup> for fat, and then autoclaved to simulate a heated equipment surface.

[19] Statement of problem: The clinical performance of implant-retained overdentures (IODs) with plastic bar clips made of different materials in the same design and dimensions may vary according to the patient's daily home care procedures. However, information about the effects of denture cleaning solutions on the retention of Hader bar clips is lacking. Purpose: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the retention of Hader bar clips made of different polymers after being soaked in denture cleaning solutions. Material and methods: Ninety Hader bar clips made of polyamide (PA, n=30), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, n=30), and polyetherketoneketone (PEKK, n=30) materials were tested. Two multiunit abutments were screwed onto the implant analogs and embedded into an acrylic resin block in a standardized position. The digital scanning of the abutments was acquired, and the bar patrix of each material system milled from a cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloy disk by using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM). After the milled bar patrices were screwed onto abutments and the metal housings of the bar clips were embedded into acrylic resin blocks, they were connected passively at the same angulation to a universal testing machine. The initial retention values of all Hader bar clips were measured, and each material system was divided into 3 subgroups (n=10) before soaking in the cleaning solutions: distilled water (DW), 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), or sodium bicarbonate-sodium perborate (SBSP). Each material was soaked for the equivalent of 3 months of clinical use. The final retention values of each Hader bar clip were measured. The data were statistically analyzed by using a 2-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), the Tukey honestly significant difference (HSD) test, and the paired sample t test (α=.05). Results: The 2-way ANOVA showed that the denture cleaning solution, the clip material, and their interactions led to significantly different retention values (P<.001). A decrease was observed for the retention values of all test groups after soaking in the cleaning solutions (P<.05). No retention was observed for the PTFE clips after soaking in the 5% NaOCI solution. Conclusions: The denture cleaning solutions negatively affected the retention of Hader bar clips, regardless of the type of solution and clip material. The 5% NaOCI solution not only decreased the retention of PTFE clips but also completely degraded it.

Radiofrequency (RF), non-contact, selective-field device Vanquish® has been developed to selectively induce deep fat tissue heating to reduce waist circumference. Our analysis evaluates immediate and sustained effects of this treatment on cardiovascular autonomic function and on selected metabolic parameters. Study design/ patients and methods: A retrospective proof-of-concept analysis of RF treatment effects was conducted in 20 individuals with metabolic syndrome, to reduce the subcutaneous abdominal fat. Four 30-minutes treatment sessions (manufacturers standard protocol) were performed in 1-week intervals. Vital signs, ECG, lab screening, body composition, subcutaneous fat thickness and spectral analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) have been examined before, after the 1 st and 4 th treatment, and at follow-up visits 1 month and 3 months after the treatment. Results: The RF treatment led to a significant reduction of abdominal circumference after the 4 th session (p&<0.001), and during follow-up after 1 and 3 months (p&<0.001 and p&<0.02, resp.). There was a significant correlation (r=-0.58, p=0.007) between reduction of abdominal circumference and initial very-low frequency (VLF) spectral power at 1 month follow-up. A significant increase of cumulative spectral power in low frequency (p=0.02) and reduction in high frequency (p=0.05) band have been observed immediately (20 +14 minutes) after the treatment. On the contrary, no sustained impact on autonomic balance has been recorded 39 +18 days after the treatment. A significant correlation between the initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to one treatment was observed in VLF and total spectral bands (r&>0.59, p&<0.04). Conclusions: Our analysis shows that the selective-field RF treatment is safe and efficient for reduction of subcutaneous abdominal fat. While the treatment increases the immediate sympathetic response of the body to deep tissue heating, no sustained change in autonomic function could be recorded at 1 month follow-up. The observed correlation between initial VLF spectral power and waist circumference reduction at follow-up, as well as the association of initial adiponectin values and immediate autonomic response to the treatment might be instrumental for decisions on body contouring strategies.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a study using the Vanquish® RF device, which reports a significant reduction in abdominal circumference after the fourth treatment session and at both 1- and 3-month follow-ups.

We also propose very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, our circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors through resistors. Since the circuits calculate multiple weighted-sums by charging a capacitance, they can be operated with extremely low energy consumption. However, because a relatively long time constant is required to guarantee calculation resolution in the time domain, they have to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed, fabricated, and tested a proof-of-concept complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) VLSI chip using a 250-nm fabrication technology to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model with binary weights and PWM input signals, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip, memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors, unlike in the ordinary in-memory-computing circuits. We evaluated the energy efficiency and temperature characteristics by measurement using the fabricated chip, where the highest energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300 TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per Second per Watt). The effects by a temperature change can be compensated for by adjusting the bias voltage.

[2]: The Moroccan phosphate industry releases large amounts of heavy metals in the Atlantic Ocean in the surroundings of two places: Safi and Jorf Lasfar. The major waste, called phosphogypsum and composed of calcium sulphate and other additional salts, is introduced into sea water in particulate form. After dissolution of the particles, heavy metal concentrations can be influenced near the release point. Two multi-element analytical techniques were used to measure 47 element concentrations in various materials involved in the study of the phosphate pollution: Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICPMS) and instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). At first, phosphate and phosphogypsum were characterized in order to recognize the overall features of the heavy metal pollution source. From the yearly amount of phosphogypsum produced by the Moroccan industry and the element concentrations in phosphogypsum, it has been possible to estimate a yearly flux of heavy metals introduced in the Atlantic Ocean. Algae were used as bio-accumulator materials of heavy metals in the marine environment, in the region of Jorf Lasfar, in order to significantly reveal the signal of the heavy metal pollution. Ulva lactuca Linnaeus was selected to assess heavy metal pollution around the waste release point. Accumulation factors were determined for 47 elements in U. lactuca, by comparing mean concentrations obtained in algae collected in non-polluted sites (background sites) and an average sea water concentration given in the literature. The ratio between the concentration in U. lactuca, collected in a polluted site to the background concentration in U. lactuca, was determined, giving an estimate of the pollution factor for the same elements by the phosphate industry. The decrease of the pollution due to the dilution in the sea water was observed as far as 6 km southward of the release point. A specific variation was observed for lead and its isotopic composition, denoting that the phosphate industry is not the only pollution source in this region. Natural processes were likely involved to induce the lead concentrations variations along the littoral. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.
[3]: The concentrations and chemical distributions of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, U, and V) in the Al-Jiza phosphate ores were investigated. Typically, the mean concentration values of Cd, Cr, Ni, U, and Zn are 15 ± 8, 109 ± 21, 34 ± 6, 211 ± 55, 142 ± 55, and 161 ± 57 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. On the other hand, the encountered average concentration values of Cd, Cr, Ni, Zn, U, and V in the phosphate dust particles (<0.053) were found to be 22 ± 5, 179 ± 5, 67 ± 11, 441 ± 14, 225 ± 58, and 311 ± 9 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The contamination factors of U and Cr are greater than 1, indicating that these heavy metals could be potentially hazardous, if released to the environment. Multivariate statistical analysis allowed the identification of three main factors controlling the distribution of these heavy metals and the other chemical constituents. The extracted factors are as follows: francolite mineral factor, clay minerals factor, and diagenesis factor. Health risk assessments of non-cancerous effects in finer-grained size fraction that might be caused by contamination with the heavy elements have been calculated for both children and adults. The risk assessments in case of children for non-cancerous effects showed that U has values greater than the safe level of hazard index (HI = 1). In case of adults, the value of risk for U is also higher as compared to those of Cd, Ni, Cr, and Zn where it lies within the safe range of hazard index (HI < 1). Child health risk assessment indicates that children are more vulnerable to contaminants from phosphate mining than adults. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The references collectively provide evidence that industrial wastewater contains many of these metals (e.g., cadmium, chromium, nickel, zinc, lead, copper, mercury), that phosphate industry by-products contribute heavy metals including uranium and vanadium, and that wastewater used in agriculture exhibits the presence of arsenic, manganese, and iron. In addition, one reference demonstrates a correlation between phosphorus accumulation and several heavy metals (Pb, Cr, Zn, Ni, Cu) in water systems. Thus, when taken together, the references support the claim’s list (even though different sources emphasize different metals) and the stated origins and potential risks.

s_1222,Entailment,Key Findings: Desire for Better Information and Support: Women express a strong desire for better information and support from healthcare providers. They value social support and the opportunity to learn about menopause alongside other women experiencing similar changes . This indicates a need for more comprehensive and supportive healthcare approaches.,"[12] Perimenopause, or the menopausal transition, represents a period of time during which newly arising symptoms can present complex management decisions for providers. Many women present to care with complaints of hot flashes, vaginal and sexual changes, altered mood and sleep, and changing bleeding patterns. The effect of these symptoms on quality of life, even before a woman enters menopause, can be significant. The appropriate evaluation and evidence-based management of women in this transition is reviewed in this article. Two case vignettes are used to highlight certain evaluation and treatment challenges. [14] Background and purpose: Quality of life (QOL) is believed to be influenced by sexual function during menopause. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sexual function and QOL among post-menopausal women. Materials and methods: We performed a community-based, descriptive-analytical study of 405 post-menopausal women, aged 40 to 65 years. A multi-stage, randomized sampling was conducted. Data was obtained through interviews using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BRIEF)WHOQOL-BREF(, and a researcher-made questionnaire. Data was then analyzed using t-test and multiple linear regression. Results: The mean age and mean duration of menopause were 52.84±3.7 years and 19.8±14.4 months, respectively. Among the subjects 324 (80%) were housewives and 369 (91.2%) had diploma or lower levels of education. The mean total score of QOL was 54.53±7.18. The highest and lowest scores were associated with physical health and psychological health domains, respectively. Overall, 61% had female sexual dysfunction (FSD). The total scores for FSFI were in a positive correlation with the total scores for WHOQOL-BREF (r=0.285, P<0.001) and the scores for all domains of QOL. The scores in all domains of FSFI, except in the domain of pain, had a positive correlation with the total score of QOL (P<0.001). Satisfaction with marital relationship in post-menopausal women was associated with an increase in QOL (P<0.001, r=0.258). Conclusion: Sexual dysfunction could have a negative impact on the quality of life in post-menopausal women. Therefore, to enhance the quality of life in this population sexual dysfunction requires more attention when implementing women's health initiatives. [16] Early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency is associated with negative health impacts, unmet information needs, delayed diagnosis, and variation in management. Co-designed digital resources for women with early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency and health practitioners were developed to address information needs and support management. A five-phase mixed methods multidisciplinary research, co-design and translation process comprised: (1) survey/interviews with women and health practitioners to explore early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency needs, experiences, and management; (2) appraisal of clinical guidelines to develop management algorithms; (3) digital resource development (https://healthtalkaustralia.org/early-menopause-experiences-and-perspectives-of-women-and-health-professionals/; (4) evaluation; and (5) dissemination/implementation. The digital resources included audio/video clips of women with early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency and health practitioners providing early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency care, a question prompt list, health practitioner algorithms, information links, and a list of services for women, achieving high satisfaction ratings from women and health practitioners. Engaging our stakeholder partners, multimodal dissemination has included community and conference presentations, social media, lay and professional publications, and webinars. This project provides a model for successful interdisciplinary co-design research translation to improve women's health.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that women express a strong desire for better information and support from healthcare providers, valuing social support and opportunities to learn about menopause with peers, which suggests a need for a more comprehensive, supportive approach in their care. The provided reference [16] discusses early menopause/premature ovarian insufficiency, noting unmet information needs, negative health impacts, and the development of co-designed digital resources to address these needs and improve support. While the reference does not explicitly describe women’s expressed desire for group learning or social support, it emphasizes that there are significant information gaps and a need for enhanced supporting structures. This alignment between the unmet information needs described in the reference and the claim’s focus on better information and support indicates that the reference supports (or entails) the claim.

Therefore, the purpose of the paper is the quantitative assessment of the circular economy in the OECD countries based on the indicators assembled by the authors. The goal set was achieved through both a theoretical and empirical objective. The theoretical objective is to combine and group indicators referring to the circular economy, as they are present in the literature. The empirical objective is to develop a model of causal analysis with significance for circular economy practice, based on indicators that measure economic growth, research-development, education, recycling. To achieve the empirical objective, cluster analysis, correlation analysis and path analysis were applied. The authors' contribution consists of adapting circular economy indicators to the 5 newly created classes and applying the statistical methods mentioned in the OECD circular economy analysis. The results of empirical research reflect, on the one hand, the classification of countries for a set of indicators of the circular economy and the significant links and dependencies between the indicators analysed on the other.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that cluster and path analysis can be used to universally classify countries or regions based on circular economy (CE) indicators without considering local contexts. However, the reference only describes an application of cluster analysis (along with other statistical methods) specifically to OECD countries and does not suggest that such methods are universally applicable or that local contexts are irrelevant.

Public opinion may be influenced by broader environmental awareness and the perceived risks associated with geoengineering solutions.","Ocean acidification (OA) is rapidly emerging as a significant problem for organisms, ecosystems, and human societies. Globally, addressing OA and its impacts requires international agreements to reduce rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. However, the complex suite of drivers of changing carbonate chemistry in coastal environments also requires regional policy analysis, mitigation, and adaptation responses. In order to fundamentally address the threat of OA, environmental managers need to know where, when, and by how much changes in coastal ocean carbonate chemistry will influence human livelihoods and what they can reasonably do about these effects. Here, we synthesize available biogeochemical and ecological information on the problem of coastal acidification and review actions managers have undertaken thus far. We then describe nine opportunities ripe for decisionmakers to mitigate - and, where necessary, to adapt to - ocean acidification at the spatial scales relevant to their authority. © 2014 The Author(s) 2014.
[15]: The ocean has been shielding the earth from the worst effects of rapid climate change by absorbing excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This absorption of CO<inf>2</inf> is driving the ocean along the pH gradient towards more acidic conditions. At the same time ocean warming is having pronounced impacts on the composition, structure and functions of marine ecosystems. Warming, freshening (in some areas) and associated stratification are driving a trend in ocean deoxygenation, which is being enhanced in parts of the coastal zone by upwelling of hypoxic deep water. The combined impact of warming, acidification and deoxygenation are already having a dramatic effect on the flora and fauna of the oceans with significant changes in distribution of populations, and decline of sensitive species. In many cases, the impacts of warming, acidification and deoxygenation are increased by the effects of other human impacts, such as pollution, eutrophication and overfishing.The interactive effects of this deadly trio mirrors similar events in the Earth's past, which were often coupled with extinctions of major species' groups. Here we review the observed impacts and, using past episodes in the Earth's history, set out what the future may hold if carbon emissions and climate change are not significantly reduced with more or less immediate effect. © 2013 .",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference exclusively discusses ocean acidification and its ecological impacts, along with the broader environmental challenges that result from increases in atmospheric CO₂, warming, and deoxygenation.

The impact of wild cattle on these ecosystems can be significant, primarily through grazing activities.","Ecuadorian páramo ecosystems (EPEs) function as water sources, contain large soil carbon stores and high levels of biodiversity, and support human populations. The EPEs are mainly herbaceous páramo (HP). To inform policy and management and help drive ecological science toward a better understanding of the HP ecosystem, and the relationships among its multiple ecosystem services, we asked: (1) What is the state of the HP regarding its land use/land cover (LULC)?; and (2) Is the HP being pushed away from its natural state or it is regenerating? To answer these questions, we assessed the LULC in central EPEs using Landsat 8 imagery, Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and a Classification and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm. Results show that two-fifths of the paramo ecosystem remain as native HP (NHP) and two-fifths as anthropogenic HP (AHP). Although the anthropic alteration of the pedogenesis of young paramo soil leads to the establishment of AHP, we found evidence of regeneration and resilience of the NHP.

Infected plants produce fruits that ripen prematurely, which is a significant concern for export markets .","Sigatoka disease (SD) of bananas is caused by the pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella musicola Leach. This disease provokes necrotic lesions on leaves and serious infestations can lead to a substantial reduction in the leaf area of infected plants and thus to yield losses. In addition to these effects on yield, SD was found to have an impact on fruit quality, especially because exported bananas ripen prematurely. In the present work, a plantation survey and experiments have been conducted in Guadeloupe (FWI) to assess the effect of this disease on the greenlife of bananas harvested at a constant physiological age, as measured in degree-days (dd). Our results revealed that bananas harvested at 900 dd from plants with high Sigatoka disease severity had normal diameter growth, but a shorter greenlife (GL) than bananas harvested from uninfected plants. These results indicate that SD is directly responsible for the reduction of banana greenlife since the reduction of GL could not be attributed to the harvest of fruits at a more advanced physiological age (dd). Furthermore, a correlation was noted between SD severity and GL. The potential physiological mechanisms involved are also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We previously reported improved healing following topical infiltration of DpH in a healthy animal wound model. This study evaluates its effect on an incisional wound model in diabetic animals. METHOD: Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Two caudal and two cephalad wounds were made on the dorsal surface. A polyvinyl alcohol sponge was placed in a subcutaneous pocket created proximal to both cephalad wounds. Each wound was either treated topically with 10mg DpH in a 200microl carrier or an equal volume of the saline vehicle (control) on the day of wounding and days 3 and 6 post-incision. The animals were sacrificed on day 10. The breaking strength of fresh and fixed wounds was determined by tensiometry, and the hydroxyproline content was determined spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: There was a significant overall increase in both fresh (24%) and fixed (18%) wound-breaking strength of the DpH-treated wounds when compared with the controls (p<0.05). This was associated with an increase in collagen synthesis as indicated by the increased hydroxyproline content in the DpH-infiltrated sponges when compared with the controls.

The special engineered aquatic environment could be an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Fifteen ARGs corresponding to three groups of antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides and quinolones) were determined in surface water, soil and sediment in this study. Total concentrations of antibiotics ranged from 21.55 to 536.86 ng/L, 3.69 to 438.76 ng/g, 15.78 to 213.84 ng/g in water, soil and sediment, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ARGs revealed the presence of two sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2), five tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetB, tetM, tetQ, tetG) and class 1 integron gene (intI1) in all samples. And the relative abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes was generally higher than tetracycline resistance genes in three matrices. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found between the concentrations of intI1 and ARGs (tetA, tetB, tetM, tetQ, tetG, sul1, sul2), indicating intI1 may facilitate the proliferation and propagation of these genes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed distribution of ARGs was related to the certain antibiotics residues, which may exert selective pressure on bacteria and thus enrich the abundance of ARGs. The results of this study could provide useful information for both better understanding and management of the contamination caused by ARGs and related antibiotics in engineered aquatic environments.
[3]: Benin's waterways are affected by several forms of pollution that are linked in particular to anthropic activities. This study aims to detect the presence of antibiotic residues, the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the levels of heavy metals in Benin's waterways. 160 surface water samples from streams in Benin were collected. They were filtered by the membrane filtration method, then incubated on different media. The isolated bacterial species were identified by API 20E gallery and specific biochemical tests. After detection of the resistance profile of the latter, the antibiotic residues were quantified in the samples by the ELISA technique on plate and the physicochemical analyses were performed by Multi 3630 IDS SET KS2 multimeter. Finally, heavy metal levels were detected by the MERCK test kit method specific to each metal. The bacterial species mostly identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.59%), Klebsiella spp. (18.68%), Enterobacter spp. (12.63%). The most abundant resistance of bacterial strains was to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (92%), followed by metronidazole (86%). Metronidazole was the antibiotic with the highest residue concentration in the samples (6.578 to 6.829 μg/L), followed by ciprofloxacin (2.142 to 9.299 μg/L). Benin streams contain heavy metals such as mercury (0.454±0.129 μg/L), lead (0.040±0.50 mg/L), zinc (6.120±16.017 mg/L), nickel (0.155±0.233 mg/L) and cadmium (0.154±0.132 mg/L). The analysis of the physico-chemical parameters showed that, apart from electrical conductivity, all parameters comply with Beninese and World Health Organization standards. Actions must be taken to clean up these rivers to preserve the integrity of aquatic ecosystems in Benin.
[4]: In view of antibiotics being detected in surface waters, experiments were conducted to determine the impacts of tetracycline on planktonic bacteria in wetland and river waters. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method is often used to measure for resistance or susceptibility of microbes to antibiotics with typical concentrations of antibiotics being mg L<sup>-1</sup>. Moreover, there is the belief that antibiotics in the lower μg L<sup>-1</sup> range are unlikely to affect bacteria. We examined this assumption by measuring the effects of a broad range of tetracycline concentrations on bacterial protein production by the incorporation of l-[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H]leucine method. Tetracycline significantly (P∈<∈0.05) inhibited production in river water bacteria at a ""free"" concentration of 5 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, but the inhibition was significant only at 1000 μg L<sup>-1</sup> in wetland water.

i_1527,Contradiction,"Key Factors Influencing Community Involvement: Education and Awareness: It is likely that higher education levels alone are sufficient for better waste management practices and increased community participation, despite other influencing factors being present .","It is crucial to achieve effective solid waste management involving not only formal/ government agencies, but also individual/informal/voluntary actions in order to create a healthy environment. This study conducted to unveil the factors that increase individuals' community participation in solid waste management policy. The data were matched with a literature review on existing waste policies to identify gaps in knowledge, which could provide beneficial policy recommendations for the Jakarta Provincial Government. The ordinary least squares regression and Indonesian family life survey data were used. The respondents' waste handling and participation scores with potentially affected variables were calculated and regressed. Out of 1.791 respondents, the regression revealed that the participation of individuals from Jakarta is influenced by 1) the frequency of their involvement in social community activities, 2) their education level, and 3) per capita expenditure. The solid waste management score increased by 0.233 if the respondents were more socially active, with a participation score of 1. Empowerment had a 0.06 coefficient correlation relative to the waste handling score. According to the broader sample of 28.967 respondents from large cities in Indonesia. It was concluded that individuals' participation could be enhanced by hosting various social activities at the grassroots level. The study's gaps show that the Jakarta Provincial Government has a high propensity towards increasing individuals' participation in solid waste management by maximizing control of the factors mentioned above (especially empowerment), as well as by raising the frequency of citizens' involvement in social community activities at the grassroots level.
[2]: Numerous health issues can arise from improper domestic waste management. Uncollected wastes provide food and breeding sites for insect, bird and rodent which can expose the community to vector borne disease. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the community awareness towards domestic waste management. This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia. The questionnaire consists of five sections with a total of 57 questions. The questionnaire consists of four parts: Socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude and practice. The data were analysed using SPSS version 22.0. T-test, ANOVA test, Chi-squared test were used according to the type of variables and significance level will be taken at 95% or p-value of less than 0.05. A total of 355 respondents participated in this study. The mean age was 40.52 ±14.94. The majority of them were male (52.1%), Malay (71.0%), married (71.3%), with secondary educational (81%) and employed (41.1%). The majority of respondents mentioned that inappropriate waste management can cause dengue fever and leptospirosis (98.0%, 97.2%; respectively). Property type, education, occupation, ethnicity, religions and household income were significant influenced the knowledge of the participants towards domestic waste management. For attitude, gender, education, ethnicity, religion and income significantly influenced the attitude of the participants towards domestic waste management. For practice, ethnicity, religion and occupation were significantly influenced the practice of the participants towards domestic waste management. In conclusion, the community has moderate awareness of domestic waste management. Awareness of waste management should also be taught in school so that the next generation of people will have a better understanding and eventually have better practice in domestic waste management. It is also hoped that a carefully thought-out strategy can be developed to further improve the community awareness towards domestic waste management which will shed a new light on tackling this issue.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that higher education levels alone are sufficient for improved waste management practices and increased community participation. However, the reference indicates that participation in waste management is influenced by multiple factors—not solely education. The regression analysis highlights that factors such as involvement in social community activities and per capita expenditure also play significant roles. Therefore, the claim's focus on higher education alone is not supported and conflicts with the evidence in the reference.

The circular economy aims to keep resources in use for as long as possible and recover and regenerate products and materials at the end of their service life .","The concept of circular economy (CE) is to a growing extent treated as an alternative to the currently dominating open and linear model of economic activities. It represents a new and increasingly popular solution to environmental problems associated with too extensive use of existing natural resources, increasing pollution emission levels and too short product life-cycles. Based on a comprehensive review of the state-of-The-Art research, an integrated circular economy conceptual model applying two basic research perspectives (top-down and bottom-up approaches) was developed. The author emphasizes the need for simultaneous consideration of four main aspects: (1) CE main objectives; (2) key challenges underlying this concept; (3) essential political and social activities, and (4) sustainable practices implemented by companies. The analysis allows to conclude that an effective implementation of the concept of circular economy calls for the consideration of different motivations existing among its stakeholders while economic and social benefits need to be aligned and balanced with ecological benefits.
[2]: A recent sustainability-based economic model, the Circular Economy, is examined as a catalyst for a potential new retail model focused on an integrated sustainable system providing residential building and renovation products sales. The premise of the Circular Economy is the argument of utilizing resources continuously by extracting the maximum value from them, then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life. The research presents a qualitative study of the Circular Economy concept as an innovation outgrowth for the built environment and retailing facilities. The work proves the Circular Economy theory's necessity as applied to the retail industry, providing a new programmatic retail-based concept with a practical development as an architectural design demonstration project. This project demonstrates how through new retail programmatic synergies, the Circular Economy would be the basis for a new retail model. The application is shown through an urban redevelopment proposal of a former industrial building in a declining North American city that demonstrates Circular Economy issues in the site selection and building design.
[3]: Circular economy, i.e. a closed-loop economy, is an idea in which the value of products and materials is retained as long as possible. A concept that minimizes the environmental impact of the products created, through such choice of components and design that will allow them to be reused. Speaking of circular economy, it is impossible not to mention the role of alternative fuels. According to the EN-15359: 2005 standard - Solid recovered fuels. Specification and classes, alternative fuels are flammable wastes, defragmented, homogeneous mixtures, produced by mixing non-hazardous waste, with or without solid fuel, liquid fuel or biomass, and which, as a result of thermal transformation, do not cause emissions to exceed the limits set out in Ordinance of the Minister of the Environment on the standards of emission from the installations dealing with the process of co-incineration of waste. [3] Development of the alternative fuels market, regardless of technology, should be seen as desirable. The preparation of individual technologies for entering the fuel market is, however, most varied. In addition, a series of studies need be conducted to answer questions on the suitability and potential for using alternative fuels as a source of energy. The article presents the issues of the circular economy package and alternative fuels.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference clearly states that the circular economy (CE) is considered an alternative to the traditional linear model of economic activity, which is described as an open, linear system. Furthermore, the reference elaborates on the CE’s objectives, such as keeping resources continuously in use and recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of their service life. These details directly support the claim's description of the circular economy.

The idea is to decen-tralize the production systems and allow to reach monitoring, adaptation and optimization to be made in real time, based on the large amount of data available at shop floor that feed the use of machine learning techniques. This technological revolution will bring significant productivity gains, resources savings and reduced maintenance costs, as machines will have information to operate more efficiently, adaptable and following demand fluctuations. This paper discusses the application of supervised Machine Learning techniques allied with artificial vision, to implement an intelligent, collaborative and adaptive robotic inspection station, which carries out the quality control of Human Machine Interface (HMI) consoles, equipped with pressure buttons and LCD displays. Machine learning techniques were applied for the recognition of the operator's face, to classify the type of HMI console to be inspected, to classify the state condition of the pressure buttons and detect anomalies in the LCD displays. The developed solution reaches promising results, with almost 100% accuracy in the correct classification of the consoles and anomalies in the pressure buttons, and also high values in the detection of defects in the LCD displays. [7] There is a lot of emphasis right now on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on different sectors, especially financial services, and on jobs. This chapter discusses some examples relating to key factors in prosperity: natural catastrophe, capital markets and diversity and inclusion. Many countries lack broad and deep capital markets, and this is becoming more of an issue as governments try to encourage long term saving and develop private pension schemes. Currently, humans are investigating suspicious-looking entities, but it is likely that over time AI and machine learning can take over a lot of this activity and also help prevent fraud. One particularly interesting and wide-reaching focus in AI is natural language processing. This has the potential to improve interactions and customer service in a lot of areas, including financial services, travel and health. [8] Artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully made its way into contemporary industrial sectors such as automobiles, defense, industrial automation 4.0, healthcare technologies, agriculture, and many other domains because of its ability to act autonomously without continuous human interventions. However, this capability requires processing huge amounts of learning data to extract useful information in real time. The buzz around AI is not new, as this term has been widely known for the past half century. In the 1960s, scientists began to think about machines acting more like humans, which resulted in the development of the first natural language processing computers. It laid the foundation of AI, but there were only a handful of applications until the 1990s due to limitations in processing speed, memory, and computational power available. Since the 1990s, advancements in computer architecture and memory organization have enabled microprocessors to deliver much higher performance. Simultaneously, improvements in the understanding and mathematical representation of AI gave birth to its subset, referred to as machine learning (ML). ML includes different algorithms for independent learning, and the most promising ones are based on brain-inspired techniques classified as artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs have subsequently evolved to have deeper and larger structures and are often characterized as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolution neural networks (CNN). In tandem with the emergence of multicore processors, ML techniques started to be embedded in a range of scenarios and applications. Recently, application-specific instruction-set architecture for AI applications has also been supported in different microprocessors. Thus, continuous improvement in microprocessor capabilities has reached a stage where it is now possible to implement complex real-time intelligent applications like computer vision, object identification, speech recognition, data security, spectrum sensing, etc. This paper presents an overview on the evolution of AI and how the increasing capabilities of microprocessors have fueled the adoption of AI in a plethora of application domains. The paper also discusses the upcoming trends in microprocessor architectures and how they will further propel the assimilation of AI in our daily lives.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes Industry 4.0 applications of emerging technologies, including the use of machine learning techniques in a quality control (inspection) application, and it discusses real‐time monitoring, adaptation, and optimization on the shop floor.

Regulatory services are defined by the Millennium Assessment as ecosystem processes ""that affect climate, floods, disease, wastes, and water quality"". Cumulatively, these regulatory ser- vices are essential to moderate climate, hazards, hydrology, and pests and to purify air, land, and water resources. Wetlands are particularly significant in moderating water-vectored services such as floods and storm surges. However, many of these services are not valued by market economics, leaving them vulnerable to degradation in favor of more narrowly framed services.

Thus, a holistic integration of these technologies in existing processes structures is essential to ensure future competitiveness of companies. Current research mostly focuses on some aspects of the lifecycle and not on the whole process. Furthermore, mostly specific tools are developed to create AR and VR contents instead of using already existing and widespread programs for example the 3D CAD software Inventor [1] or game engines like Unity [2]. The tools are used to create VR content providing a user-friendly environment with limited options for content creation. On one side the use of these programs decreases the required knowledge to create Mixed Reality applications, however they are associated with high implementation and running costs. This increases the entry barrier for small and medium sized enterprises (SME) to adopt AR and VR into their value chains significantly. The presented work discusses concepts and proposes information models for adding VR-specific information directly in CAD environments.

The present study was undertaken to study the individual and interactive effects of heavy metal nickel (NiCl<inf>2</inf>·6H<inf>2</inf>O; 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 mM) and UV-B exposure (0.4 W m<sup>-2</sup>; 45 min corresponds to 1.08 KJ m<sup>-2</sup>) on growth performance and photosynthetic activity of pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings. Ni treatment at high doses (0.1 and 1.0 mM Ni) and UV-B alone reduced chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity (oxygen yield, carbon fixation, photorespiration, and PSI, PSII, and whole chain electron transport activities), and declining trends continued with combined doses. In contrast to this, Ni at 0.01 mM appeared to be stimulatory for photosynthetic pigments and photosynthetic activity, thereby enhanced biomass was observed at this concentration. However, combined dose (UV-B + 0.01 mM Ni) caused inhibitory effects. Carotenoids showed different responses to each stress. Nickel at high doses strongly inhibited PSII activity and the inhibition was further intensified when chloroplasts were simultaneously exposed to UV-B radiation. PSI activity appeared to be more resistant to each stress. High doses of Ni (0.1and 1.0 mM) and UV-B alone interrupted electron flow at the oxygen evolving complex. Similar damaging effects were caused by 0.01 and 0.1 mM Ni together with UV-B, but the damage extended to PSII reaction center in case of 1.0 mM Ni in combination with UV-B. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that low dose of Ni stimulated the growth performance of pea seedlings in contrast to its inhibitory role at high doses. However, UV-B alone and together with low as well as high doses of Ni proved to be toxic for P. sativum L. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that heavy metals enhance photosynthetic activity, particularly at low doses of Ni and under reduced UV-B stress. However, the reference reveals that although a low dose of Ni (0.01 mM) can stimulate photosynthetic pigments and activity when applied alone, UV-B exposure (even at the tested level) on its own or combined with low-dose Ni causes inhibitory effects. Additionally, the claim’s emphasis on “reduced stress from UV-B radiation” is not supported by the reference, which shows UV-B as toxic and detrimental to photosynthetic performance. Therefore, the reference provides conflicting evidence relative to the claim.

This is particularly evident in families with a strong history of diabetes, where proactive lifestyle consultations are recommended .","Background: We assessed the impact of a family history of diabetes on type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and behavioral traits in young Korean adults. Methods: Subjects aged 25-44 years were included, and the presence of a family history of diabetes was obtained by a self-reported questionnaire (the Korea National Health and Nutrition Survey 2010). We compared the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, and other metabolic parameters, including blood pressure and lipid profile. Results: Of 2059 participants, those with a family history of diabetes involving first-degree relatives (n = 489, 23.7%) had a significantly higher prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (14.3 vs. 11.7%) and type 2 diabetes (6.7 vs. 1.8%), compared to those without a family history (P < 0.001). The prevalence of metabolic syndrome (21.3 vs. 12.1%, P < 0.001) and its components (except for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were greater in subjects with a family history of diabetes. Among subjects exhibiting normal glucose tolerance (n = 1704), those with a family history of diabetes had higher fasting glucose (89.0 vs. 87.8 mg/dL, P < 0.001) and triglyceride (100.5 vs. 89.0 mg/dL, P < 0.001), and lower beta cell function by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-β; 134.2 vs. 137.5, P = 0.020). The obesity indices (body mass index, waist circumference, and triglyceride) were significantly correlated with those of both parents (P < 0.01 for all variables). Risk-reducing behavior, including regular exercise (18.2 vs. 19.7%, P = 0.469) and calorie intake (2174.8 vs. 2149.1 kcal/day, P = 0.636), did not markedly differ according to a family history of diabetes. Conclusions: Young adults with a family history of diabetes had an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome, even though they currently exhibited a normal glycemic profile. Proactive lifestyle consultation is requested especially among healthy young population with a family history of diabetes.
[6]: Background. A strong family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) confers increased DM risk. This survey analysis determined whether patients who were informed by their doctors of familial DM risk acknowledged that risk and took steps to reduce it. Methods. We conducted an analysis of the National Health Styles 2004 mail survey. All non-diabetic participants who responded to the question of whether their doctor had or had not informed them of their familial DM risk (n = 3,323) were compared for their risk-reducing behaviour and attitude to DM risk. Results. Forty-one percent (n = 616) of the question responders that had DM family histories were informed by their doctors of their familial risk; the chance of being informed increased with the number of relatives that had the disease. Members of the informed group were more likely than those in the non-informed group to report lifestyle changes to prevent DM (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.5-5.2) and being tested for DM (OR 2.9, 95% CI 2.4-3.6), although no significant improvement occurred in their U.S.-recommended exercise activity (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7-1.1). Overall, informed responders recognised both their familial and personal DM risk; most discussed diabetes with their family (69%), though less so with friends (42%); however, 44% of them still did not consider themselves to be at risk. Conclusion. Responders who were informed by their doctors of being at familial DM risk reported greater incidences of lifestyle changes, DM screening, and awareness of risk than non-informed responders. Doctors were more likely to inform patients with stronger DM family histories. Identifying this higher risk group, either in isolation or in combination with other recognised risk factors, offers doctors the opportunity to target limited health promotion resources efficiently for primary DM prevention. © 2008 Qureshi and Kai; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that family members of individuals with diabetes show higher metabolic risks and behavioral traits that increase their susceptibility to diabetes, and it recommends proactive lifestyle consultations, particularly in families with a strong history of diabetes. The provided references support that a family history of diabetes is associated with increased metabolic risks—evidenced by higher prevalence of impaired fasting glucose, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome among young adults—as well as the recommendation of proactive lifestyle consultations. Although one study noted that risk-reducing behaviors (e.g., exercise and calorie intake) did not differ significantly, the overall message that family history is linked to higher diabetes risk and the need for preventative consultation is clearly supported.

s_2074,Contradiction,"Negative Impacts: Vegetation and Soil Degradation: Grazing by cattle can lead to the degradation of vegetation and soil structure. This includes reductions in plant height, cover, and biomass, which can impair ecosystem functions such as water retention and carbon storage . In the paramo, this could translate to reduced resilience and increased vulnerability to erosion and other environmental stresses.","The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.
[3]: Unrestricted cattle access to rivers and streams represent a potentially significant localised pressure on freshwater systems. However there is no consensus in the literature on the occurrence and extent of impact and limited research has examined the effects on aquatic biota in the humid temperate environment examined in the present study. Furthermore, this is one of the first times that research consider the potential for cattle access impacts in streams of varying water quality in Northern Europe. We investigated the effects of cattle access on macroinvertebrate communities and deposited fine sediment levels, in four rivers of high/good and four rivers of moderate water quality status which drain, low gradient, calcareous grassland catchments in Ireland. We assessed the temporal variability in macroinvertebrates communities across two seasons, spring and autumn. Site specific impacts were evident which appeared to be influenced by water quality status and season. All four high/good water status rivers revealed significant downstream changes in community structure and at least two univariate metrics (total richness and EPT richness together with taxon, E and EPT abundance). Two of the four moderate water status rivers showed significant changes in community structure, abundance and richness metrics and functional feeding groups driven in the main by downstream increases in collectors/gatherers, shredders and burrowing taxa. These two moderate water status rivers had high or prolonged livestock activity. In view of these findings, the potential for some of these sites to achieve at least high/good water quality status, as set out in the EU Water Framework Directive, may be compromised. The results presented highlight the need for additional research to further define the site specific factors and livestock management practices, under different discharge conditions, that increase the risk of impact on aquatic ecology due to these cattle-river interactions.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim refers to cattle grazing degrading vegetation and soil structure specifically in the paramo ecosystem, leading to reduced plant height, cover, biomass, and impaired ecosystem functions.

i_696,Unverifiable,"Noise Reduction Strategies: Vibration Isolation: Techniques such as using springs, rubber pads, and pneumatic cushions to minimize the impact of vibrations .","[3] This paper presents computational methods that are used by rolling stock manufacturers to predict noise inside vehicles. For airborne transmission, which dominates in the medium-high frequency range, a four-step procedure is applied: source description by their emitted sound power level, propagation of noise to the train's exterior surface, panel transmission loss and acoustic response of the interior cavity. Reasonable agreement between computations and measurements is usually obtained, and the method makes it possible to rank the different source contributions and airborne transmission paths. Structure borne noise dominates in low frequencies. Finite Element models are used to improve car body design (dynamic stiffness at input points and carbody vibroacoustic transfers), but they do not cover the whole problem since the modelling of excitation from the bogie is not included. Recent research allowing the computation of blocked forces at car body input points and starting with wheel/rail interaction is briefly presented. Concerning source modelling, a focus is made on traction noise, including electromagnetic excitations in electric motors and mechanical excitations due to the meshing process inside gearboxes. Efficient computational methods and validation examples are presented. The coupling of these methods with optimization methods has great potential for improvement of motor noise and vibration design. [14] The noise of domestic machines including lawnmowers becomes an urgent issue. As the technology matures, designers need better tools to predict performance and efficiency of these machines across a wide range of operating conditions and find optimal ways to reduce noise. Computational fluid dynamics is an increasingly powerful tool which enables designer to better understand all features of unsteady flow in these machines and to find optimal designs providing higher energetic characteristics, better cutting quality and lower pressure pulsation, vibration and noise. Cutting quality linked with evacuation of grass is a key lawnmower characteristic. Due to this fact application of two-phase (air-grass) lawnmower flow model is inevitable in a prediction procedure. The modeling procedure comprises determination of lawnmower average aerodynamic characteristics and CFD-CAA analysis by acoustic-vortex method to predict sound power data. This method is based on splitting the equations of compressible fluid dynamics into two modes - vortex and acoustic Computational approach applied for the vortex mode flow is a ""moving body""- technique: the problem is solved in the absolute frame of coordinates and computational grid changes during the blade passing. Computations can be made in 4 stages: 1) Computation of the incompressible medium with getting average values of energetic parameters; 2) Computation of the incompressible medium for definition the source function of inhomogeneous acoustic-vortex wave equation; 3) Solution of the acoustic-vortex wave equation; 4) Computation of 2-phase flow. In the 3rd stage the pressure pulsation field can be represented like a sum of acoustic and vortex oscillation. Wave equation is solved relatively to pressure oscillation using an explicit numerical procedure. Zero pulsatory pressure is an initial condition for solution of the wave equation. The local complex specific acoustic impedance is used to define boundary conditions for the acoustical part of the pressure field. Thus the numerical procedure gives pressure pulsations field and sound power data on blade passing frequencies (BPF). For the 4th stage computations effective grass particle parameters are determined with accounting the stubble effect on flow parameters and particularities of grass particle interaction with rigid surfaces. Results of a lawnmower air-grass flow (grass particle trajectories and concentration) and corresponding BPF sound power data prediction are presented as an example of modeling procedure application.

Mutations in the estrogen receptor gene (ESR1) can lead to endocrine resistance and increased proliferative activity in metastatic cells .","Activating mutations of estrogen receptor α gene (ESR1) in breast cancer can cause endocrine resistance of metastatic tumor cells. The skeleton belongs to the metastatic sides frequently affected by breast cancer. The prevalence of ESR1 mutation in bone metastasis and the corresponding phenotype are not known. In this study bone metastases from breast cancer (n=231) were analyzed for ESR1 mutation. In 27 patients (12%) (median age 73 years, range: 55-82 years) activating mutations of ESR1 were detected. The most frequent mutation was p.D538G (53%), no mutations in exon 4 (K303) or 7 (S463) were found. Lobular breast cancer was present in 52% of mutated cases (n=14) and in 49% of all samples (n=231), respectively. Mutated cancers constantly displayed strong estrogen receptor expression. Progesterone receptor was positive in 78% of the mutated cases (n=21). From 194 estrogen receptor-positive samples, 14% had ESR1 mutated. Except for one mutated case, no concurrent HER2 overexpression was noted. Metastatic breast cancer with activating mutations of ESR1 had a higher Ki67 labeling index than primary luminal cancers (median 30%, ranging from 5 to 60% with 85% of cases revealing ≥20% Ki67-positive cells). From those patients from whom information on endocrine therapy was available (n=7), two had received tamoxifen only, 4 tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitors and one patient had been treated with aromatase inhibitors only.

s_1023,Contradiction,"Comparison with Surgeon Palpation: Surgeon Palpation: Advantages in Minimally Invasive Surgery: In minimally invasive procedures, the presence of advanced imaging techniques can enhance the surgeon's ability to accurately assess tissue properties, compensating for the lack of direct tactile feedback .","In traditional open surgery, surgeons use their fingertip palpation to investigate the hidden anatomical structures of tissue. However, in the current commercially available minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) systems, while surgical instruments interact with tissues, surgeons do not sense any tactile information. Therefore, tactile sensors are required to be integrated into the tips of surgical instruments to mimic the perception of the surgeon's fingertips. The electrically based tactile sensors that exist at present cannot usually operate under static loading conditions. In addition, they are not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. Therefore, this research was aimed at restoring tactile information by developing an MRI compatible optical fiber tactile sensor. The sensor consists of only one single moving part. Thanks to this novel design, the sensor does not require the use of an array of sensors to measure the distributed tactile information. This capability simplifies the integration of the sensor into any suitable space available at the tips of surgical instruments. In addition, the sensor performs under both static and dynamic loading conditions. A theoretical model of the sensor and a finite-element model of the sensor-tissue interaction were developed. To validate the sensor, a prototype of the sensor was fabricated and tested. © 2006 IEEE.

Therefore, many researchers have focused on recovering this information through sensing systems and estimation algorithms.

However, it is likely that these same factors will have a similar level of influence in the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Sea, despite the differences in environmental conditions.","Skipjack tuna habitat in the western North Pacific was studied from satellite remotely sensed environment and catch data, using generalized additive models and geographic information systems. Weekly resolved remotely sensed sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy data were used for the year 2004. Fifteen generalized additive models were constructed with skipjack catch per unit effort as a response variable, and sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy as model covariates to assess the effect of environment on catch per unit effort (skipjack tuna abundance).

i_2292,Unverifiable,"Soil Organic Matter and Microbial Communities: Microbial Interactions: AM fungi interact with other beneficial soil microorganisms, such as rhizosphere bacteria, to promote plant growth and enhance soil health. These interactions can mobilize nutrients and degrade organic pollutants, further improving soil quality .","[1] Ecological and biological engineering contribute indirectly to the fitness of the soil environment and promote plant growth and protection. This engineering modifies soil physical, chemical, and biological attributes to enhance nutrient cycling, increase soil organic matter, and improve soil quality. Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, under most conditions, improve plant growth directly by providing greater and more efficient access via fungal hyphae for absorption of nutrients, especially P, and delivery of these nutrients to the plant. The AM symbiosis also augments disease resistance in host plants and suppresses the growth of non-mycorrhizal weeds. When plants moved from an aquatic to a terrestrial environment, mycorrhizal fungi were an integral part of their success by providing efficient nutrient absorption from the low organic matter mineral soil. In addition, AM fungi stabilize soil aggregates and promote the growth of other soil organisms by exuding photosynthetically-derived carbon into the mycorrhizosphere. Glomalin is a glycoprotein produced by AM fungi which probably originated as a protective coating on fungal hyphae to keep water and nutrients from being lost prior to reaching the plant host and to protect hyphae from decomposition and microbial attack. This substance also helps in stabilizing soil aggregates by forming a protective polymer-like lattice on the aggregate surface. AM fungal growth and biomolecules engineer well-structured soil where the distribution of water-stable aggregates and pore spaces provides resistance to wind and water erosion, greater air and water infiltration rates favorable for plant and microbial growth, nutrients in protect micro-sites near the plant roots, and protection to aggregate-occluded organic matter. © 2008 Springer Netherlands. [5] Although plants are known to have a strong influence on soil biota, the effect of groundcover vegetation in perennial cropping systems on soil fungi has been little explored. We surveyed extensively managed vineyards to determine how plant community functional characteristics, soil factors, and irrigation management related to the abundance of two guilds of soil fungi that may play a role in plant-soil feedback (entomopathogenic fungi represented by Beauveria bassiana, and the pathogenic species complex, Ilyonectria spp.). We found that plant community characteristics were related to fungal abundance for both fungi assayed. Beauveria bassiana increased with native species, annual plants, and legumes consistently across sampling periods. Ilyonectria spp. increased with the abundance of forbs and exotic species, though only the relationship with forbs was consistent across sampling periods. Both fungal guilds increased with increasing soil organic matter. The use of dual or sprinkler irrigation systems also increased B. bassiana and Ilyonectria spp. in vineyard soils. Overall, groundcover vegetation played a significant role in driving abundance of these important groups of soil fungi. Groundcover management may therefore be a viable tool to manipulate soil fungi with the potential for improving ecosystem services such as conservation biological control of soil dwelling insect pests and deterring pathogens in perennial cropping systems. [10] Background: Exotic species often do no harm for many generations and then become invasive. The science of invasion ecology seeks to determine the nature or causes of this change. Among the possibilities is that soil-borne fungi play a significant role in reducing the potential for invasiveness in the introduced range. Predictions: The seed survival of invasive species in the soil exceeds that of non-invasives. Seed survival, both in invasives and non-invasives, is higher in the presence of fungicide, but fungicide improves the seed survival of non-invasives more than that of invasives. Methods: A common garden experiment under field conditions to compare seed survival in the soil between invasive and non-invasive exotic plant species. We contrasted seven congeneric pairs of invasive and non-invasive species. The species in each pair originated from the same donor continent, shared similar growth form, habitat occurrence, and residence times in Australia. The addition of fungicide was used as an experimental treatment. Results: Seed survival was significantly higher in invasive species. The addition of fungicide improved seed survival. However, there was also a significant interaction: the fungicide treatment had a significantly stronger effect on the seed survival of non-invasive species. Seed mass differences between congeners did not provide a consistent, significant explanation of seed survival differences. Conclusion: The seeds of invasive species are better equipped to survive in the soil than those of non-invasive species. Moreover, soil-borne fungi play a key role in the lower seed survival of non-invasive species. © 2012 Megan L.

After 15 years, herbaceous plus woody control increased pine merchantable volume per acre by an average of 23 to 121 percent compared to no competition control. Increment cores, 12 mm in diameter, were collected from 36 trees in each of the 4 treatments from each of the 13 locations. X-ray densitometry was used to determine annual growth, proportion of latewood, and specific gravity (SG) of earlywood, latewood, and annual rings. Woody plus herbaceous competition control significantly increased growth at all locations, did not significantly reduce ring SG of earlywood or latewood, and did not significantly affect proportion of latewood in the annual ring. Woody plus herbaceous competition control did significantly increase growth during juvenile wood formation in years 1 to 5 and thus increased the diameter of the juvenile wood core by an average of 19 percent.

Trees were injected once in the spring of 2005 (Mississippi) or 2006 (Alabama) and then were baited with species-specific bark beetle lures several weeks later. The southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis Zimmermann, was the target species but was changed to Ips spp. in Mississippi (but not Alabama) the second year because of few southern pine beetle attacks on baited trees. Single injections of emamectin benzoate were effective in reducing tree mortality caused by bark beetles compared with untreated checks. Although less effective overall, fipronil also significantly reduced tree mortality from southern pine beetle compared with the checks during the second year in Alabama. Tree mortality continued well after the lures had been removed. Evaluations of bolts taken from experimental trees killed in 2006 indicated that emamectin benzoate effectively prevented parent bark beetle gallery construction and that fipronil significantly reduced lengths of galleries constructed by adult beetles, brood development, and emergence, compared with checks.

i_1175,Unverifiable,Key Factors Contributing to TB Prevalence in Asia: Healthcare System and Policy Issues: Drug Resistance: The emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is a significant challenge in Asia. Factors such as inadequate treatment adherence and the presence of drug-resistant strains contribute to the high prevalence of MDR-TB .,"Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. What is perhaps less appreciated is that the caseload of tuberculosis patients in South Asia is staggering. South Asia has almost 40% of the global TB burden with 4,028,165 cases in 2015. This region also has a disproportionate share of TB deaths (681,975 deaths, 38% of the global burden). Worldwide just 12.5% of TB cases are in HIV positive individuals, but much research and investment has focused on HIV-associated TB. Only 3.5% of patients with tuberculosis in South Asia have HIV co-infection. Not surprisingly with such a huge burden of disease, this region has an estimated 184,336 multi drug resistant (MDR) cases among notified TB cases which accounts for a third of global MDR burden. Crucially, at least 70% of the estimated MDR cases remain untreated in this region and MDR treatment success ranged from only 46% for India to 88% for Sri Lanka in the 2012 cohort that received treatment. This region represents many of the drivers of the modern TB epidemic: rapid urbanization and high density populations with dramatically rising incidence of diabetes, a burgeoning and largely unregulated private sector with escalating drug resistance and high air pollution both outdoor and household. Conclusion: From bacterial biochemistry to policy implementation, we suggest ways in which South Asia can seize the opportunity lead global TB elimination by demonstrating feasibility in some of the world's most densely populated cities and remotest reaches of the Himalayas. Clearly political will is essential, but we cannot defeat TB without understanding how to eliminate it in South Asia.
[11]: Information on drug resistance and transmission patterns of tuberculosis (TB) in foreign-born patients is lacking in Asia where immigration is increasing. We examined the drug-resistance profiles of 288 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from foreign-born patients in South Korea, and assessed for potential transmission in the host country by analysing their IS6110 genotypes, as well as those of 4780 strains from native Korean TB patients. The prevalence of multidrugresistant (MDR) TB was 9.7% and 42% among new and previously treated patients, respectively. Chinese nationality was associated with MDR TB (OR <inf>China</inf>=3.0, 95% CI 1.1-9.3). Of the 288 strains, 51 (17.7%) formed 31 clusters, of which 22 were identical to strains from native Koreans. A number of strains belonged to the K family, subtypes known to occur endemically in Korea. MDR TB was common, and clustering patterns showed potential cross-cultural transmission among foreign-born TB patients. Further molecular epidemiological studies of all isolates in the area are needed to determine the extent of international TB transmission in Asia. © 2011 SGM.
[12]: Background: Sudan is a large country with a diverse population and history of civil conflict. Poverty levels are high with a gross national income per capita of less than two thousand dollars. The country has a high burden of tuberculosis (TB) with an estimated 50,000 incident cases during 2009, when the estimated prevalence was 209 cases per 100,000 of the population. Few studies have been undertaken on TB in Sudan and the prevalence of drug resistant disease is not known.Methods: In this study Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from 235 patients attending three treatment centers in Sudan were screened for susceptibility to isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin by the proportion method on Lowenstein Jensen media. 232 isolates were also genotyped by spoligotyping. Demographic details of patients were recorded using a structured questionnaire. Statistical analyses were conducted to examine the associations between drug resistance with risk ratios computed for a set of risk factors (gender, age, case status - new or relapse, geographic origin of the patient, spoligotype, number of people per room, marital status and type of housing).Results: Multi drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), being resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, was found in 5% (95% CI: 2,8) of new cases and 24% (95% CI: 14,34) of previously treated patients. Drug resistance was associated with previous treatment with risk ratios of 3.51 (95% CI: 2.69-4.60; p < 0.001) for resistance to any drug and 5.23 (95% CI: 2.30-11.90; p < 0.001) for MDR-TB. Resistance was also associated with the geographic region of origin of the patient, being most frequently observed in patients from the Northern region and least in the Eastern region with risk ratios of 7.43 (95%CI:3.42,16.18; p: < 0.001) and 14.09 (95%CI:1.80,110.53; p:0.026) for resistance to any drug and MDR-TB. The major genotype observed was of the Central Asia spoligotype family (CAS1_Delhi), representing 49% of the 232 isolates examined.Conclusions: We conclude that emergence of drug resistant tuberculosis has the potential to be a serious public health problem in Sudan and that strengthened tuberculosis control and improved monitoring of therapy is needed. Further surveillance is required to fully ascertain the extent of the problem. © 2011 Sharaf Eldin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that multidrug‐resistant TB (MDR-TB) is a significant challenge in Asia and attributes its high prevalence to factors such as inadequate treatment adherence and the presence of drug-resistant strains. While the reference provides substantial data on the high burden of TB in South Asia, the prevalence and challenges associated with MDR-TB, and even touches on issues such as an unregulated private sector and untreated cases, it does not explicitly mention inadequate treatment adherence as a contributing factor. Without a clear reference to treatment adherence, one key part of the claim lacks direct support.

i_2150,Entailment,"Nutrient Uptake and Soil Interaction: Soil pH and Nutrient Availability: Heavy metals can alter soil pH, which in turn affects the availability of essential nutrients. For instance, Cu and Pb exposure can lead to soil acidification, impacting soil nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities and nutrient uptake .","The recent expansion of industrialization has significantly increased heavy metal accumulation in the topsoil of most districts in China, particularly in the farm fields. Heavy metal concentration in the soil determines its chemical properties – especially the pH and nitrogen (N) content. Since plants are dependent on soil N-fixing bacterial communities (SNB) for the availability of this nutrient, it is essential to assess the impact of heavy metals on SNB composition. This study aims to evaluate the effect of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb), both individually and in combination, on the physiological properties of the soil and the SNB composition in the wheat rhizosphere. The number of SNB species and species richness decreased significantly following heavy metal exposure, likely due to considerable soil acidification, which further increased heavy metal accumulation and dissolution. Pb exerted greater toxic effects on SNB composition compared to Cu due to higher acidification. However, alpha diversity of SNB was not significantly affected by either heavy metal, even when combined, indicating that heavy metals do not always synergistically act on soil bacterial communities. Some SNB taxa, mainly c__Alphaproteobacteria, o__Sphingomonadales, f__Desulfarculaceae, o__Micrococcales and f__Clostridiales Family XVII Incertae Sedis, showed significant alterations under high concentrations of Cu and/or Pb. This is likely due to the selective pressure exerted by the heavy metals on different SNB which increases the abundance of some and decreases that of others. Taken together, soil pH is an important indicator of heavy metal-induced shift in SNB composition due to the altered uptake and utilization of nutrients. The findings offer new insights into the synergistic effects of Cu and Pb in the soil, which can have long-term effects on crop yield.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that heavy metals (specifically Cu and Pb) can alter soil pH, leading to impacts on nutrient uptake by affecting soil nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities. The reference indicates that heavy metal contamination (from industrialization) significantly increases heavy metal accumulation, alters soil chemical properties (notably pH and nitrogen content), and causes soil acidification. It further explains that this acidification decreases the number and richness of the SNB (soil nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities), thereby impacting nutrient uptake. Since the reference directly supports the chain of effects mentioned in the claim, the information provided logically leads to the claim being correct.

i_268,Entailment,"Applications: ResUNet has been effectively used in various medical imaging tasks, such as the segmentation of organs at risk in thoracic CT images and the segmentation of the glottal area in laryngeal images . Its ability to handle complex segmentation tasks with high accuracy makes it a valuable tool in computer-aided diagnosis systems.","The glottis's morphology not only reflects vocal and respiratory information, but also plays an important role in the diagnosis of laryngeal diseases. The glottis segmentation is a primary step in computer-aided diagnostic system, however is challenging due to various shapes of glottis, low contrast with surrounding tissues, the existence of laryngeal diseases and so on. In this paper, a deep attention network based on U-Net with color normalization operation (CN-DA-Unet) is proposed to achieve an end-to-end segmentation of the glottal area for the first time. The original images are first processed by color normalization to reduce the adverse effects of low contrast and large differences in colors between different images. The normalized images are then sent to the proposed DA-Unet for feature extraction. In this network, residual structure is incorporated to extract rich features from deep neural networks. After extracting features, a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module is applied to enhance the semantic information of the glottal area. These features are up-sampled and added to the features from the corresponding encoding layer for several times to obtain the final segmented image. The proposed approach is tested on laryngeal images of an in–house dataset including images from healthy subjects and pathologic subjects. Its performance is evaluated by several reliable and popular evaluation metrics, achieving the dice coefficient of 92.9%, sensitivity of 93.5% and precision of 92.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the better performance comparing with several popular networks.
[3]: Computed Tomography (CT) has been widely used in the planning of radiation therapy, which is one of the most effective clinical lung cancer treatment options. Accurate segmentation of organs at risk (OARs) in thoracic CT images is a key step for radiotherapy planning to prevent healthy organs from getting over irradiation. However, known automatic image segmentation methods can hardly yield desired OAR delineation results, while manual delineation tends to take long time and tedious effort. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning network, called cascaded SE-ResUnet, for automatic segmentation of thoracic organs including left lung, right lung, heart, esophagus, trachea, and spinal cord. Specifically, we first use a coarse segmentation network to identify the regions of interest (ROIs), and then a fine segmentation network is applied to achieve refined segmentation results, organ by organ. Finally, different configured models are ensembled to obtain the final segmentation results. In the StructSeg 2019 Challenge, we showed the capability of our new framework and won the 1st place at the test phase. Our code is available open-source at https://github.com/zjuybh/StructSeg2019.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that ResUNet has been effectively used for medical imaging tasks, specifically for segmenting organs at risk in thoracic CT images and the glottal area in laryngeal images, and highlights its value in computer-aided diagnosis systems. The reference provides two pieces of evidence: one section details a deep network incorporating a residual structure (comparable to ResUNet) for glottal area segmentation in laryngeal images, and another section presents cascaded SE-ResUnet for automatic segmentation of thoracic organs at risk. Both parts support the claim that similar ResUNet variants have been effectively applied to these tasks, thereby indirectly affirming the claim's validity.

s_493,Contradiction,"Waterfall Methodology: Challenges: Inflexibility: While waterfall is often seen as less adaptable to changes once the project is underway, it is actually more reliable in delivering the initially expected scope, which can be a significant advantage in dynamic environments .","This paper proposes a method for deciding whether to insert an agile process as part of a waterfall project. Recently, many software projects adopt an agile software methodology. Still, some software is developed with traditional waterfall methodologies. Agile methods claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree. In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is demonstrated using a simple shopping web site. As a case study, the effects on rework by adoption of agile can be evaluated using the developed simulator. With comparison of predicted rework costs given a balance of waterfall or agile methods for a specific case, the project can be designed more effectively.
[2]: Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes. © 2010 by the authors.
[3]: The modern software industry is expected to provide fast software delivery and because of dynamic environment the customer requirements changes very rapidly, which has lead to inclination towards agile development approaches over other traditional approaches. It has the advantages like fast release and simplified documents which eventually lead to maximizing profit and productivity. However, it is a mammoth task to make a calculative decision about whether to use an agile approach for a given project or not because of the lack of any empirical decision making process. This paper provides a roadmap for making decision using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Agility Indicator and if selected, it further suggests which Agile Development method is better suited for among popular methods like Feature-driven Development (FDD), Lean development, Scrum, Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (XP) and Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM). It also addresses the major concern about security requirements to enhance the security features by integrating security activities from security engineering processes without degrading the agility of the agile process.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference confirms that while the waterfall methodology may be less flexible (and potentially has risks like schedule violations), it is noted for reliably delivering the initially expected scope. However, the reference does not specifically state that this reliability is a ""significant advantage in dynamic environments,"" as the discussion in the reference is more focused on comparing waterfall with agile methods and evaluating risks and rework costs rather than claiming waterfall’s reliability as beneficial in dynamic settings. Consequently, the claim’s emphasis on an advantage in dynamic environments isn’t directly supported by the reference.

i_631,Entailment,"Considerations for Site Selection and Design: Proximity to Fault Lines and Water Bodies: Avoid sites near fault lines and water bodies, as these areas are more susceptible to landslides due to seismic activity and erosion .","This paper applies, for the first time in offshore deepwater, a method based on geographic information systems for seafloor susceptibility assessment as a first approach to marine geohazard mapping in fluid leakage areas (slope instabilities, gas escapes, seabed collapses, pockmarks, etc.). The assessment was carried out in a known seabed fluid-flow province located on the Iberian margin of the Gulf of Cádiz, Spain. The method (based on statistical bivariate analysis) creates a susceptibility map that defines the likelihood of occurrence of seafloor features related to fluid flow: crater-like depressions and submarine landslides. It is based on the statistical index (Wi) method (Van Westen in Statistical landslide hazard analysis. ILWIS 2. 1 for Windows application guide. ITC Publication, Enschede, pp 73-84, 1997), in which Wi is a function of the cartographic density of seafloor features on ""factor maps"". The factors selected monitor the seafloor's capability to store and transfer hydrocarbon gases and gravitational instability triggers: geology-lithology, gas hydrate stability zone thickness (temperature, pressure-water depth and geothermal gradient), occurrence of diapirs, proximity to faults or lineaments, and slope angle of the seafloor. Results show that the occurrence of seafloor features related to fluid flow is highest where the factors ""gas source and storage"" and ""pathways of fluid escape"" converge. This means that they are particularly abundant over diapirs in contourite deposits, in the vicinity of faults, and inside theoretical gas hydrate stability fields thinned by warm undercurrents. Furthermore, the submarine landslides located on the Palaeozoic-Toarcian basement are not related to fluid leakage. This methodology provides helpful information for hazard mitigation in regional selection of potential drill sites, deep-water construction sites or pipeline routes. It is an easily applied and useful tool for taking the first step in risk assessment on a regional scale for vast areas where fluid leakage may be present, the geological model is known, and the geologically hazardous features have already been mapped. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.
[16]: Soil mechanical and submarine mass-movement initiation studies often use static and quasi-static approaches to determine the strength of soils against external mechanical stresses. However, many natural processes pose time variant stresses on soils, and hence exert key roles for submarine slope stability and submarine mass-movement initiation. Prominent examples are earthquake-, wind-, wave- and current-forces and alternating man-made loading on offshore constructions. Most soils show a weaker response to periodic loading - making dynamic and cyclic loading experiments mandatory for offshore natural hazard and risk assessment. Dynamic and cyclic triaxial testing are essential in liquefaction studies of granular soils and creep investigations of cohesive and granular sediments. So far, competing setups are used with mechanical spindles, pneumatic actuators or full hydraulic drives. The new MARUM dynamic triaxial testing device (DTTD) unit is addressing this increasing demand by enabling a wide range of test configurations. At its core it contains an ultra fast, hydraulically-driven ±20 kN cylinder and a 5 kHz real-time controller. This enables up to ±0.5 mm strokes at up to 50 Hz. Advantages to commercial systems are (1) the high flexibility in test setup, (2) the possibility to feed arbitrary signals derived from in situ measurements, and (3) full system access to all controls to expand and adjust the system abilities on the hard and software level. Applications so far include cyclic creep studies for offshore wind farms, liquefaction experiments on artificial sand-clay mixtures and studies on the behavior of submerged soils under dynamic stress conditions to evaluate slope stability and submarine landslide initiation. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2010.",Entailment,"justification: The claim advises avoiding sites near both fault lines and water bodies due to increased landslide susceptibility from seismic activity and erosion. The reference, however, is focused on marine geohazard mapping in offshore deepwater areas and discusses factors such as proximity to faults in relation to fluid-flow related seafloor features and submarine landslides. It does not address water bodies or provide evidence that areas near water bodies are more susceptible to landslides due to seismic activity and erosion. Thus, while there is partial overlap regarding faults, the reference does not offer sufficient support for the full claim.

VR use is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) at pediatric hospitals. The primary aim of this study was to retrospectively review the safety of VR by analyzing adverse events after the utilization of VR under CCLS supervision. Secondary objectives were to characterize the efficacy of VR in enhancing patient cooperation, describe the integration of VR into Child Life services, and identify interventions that accompanied VR. Methods: The Stanford Chariot Program developed VR applications, customized VR interfaces, and patient head straps, and distributed these to CCLS. Chart review analyzed VR utilization through CCLS patient notes. Inclusion criteria were all patients ages 6 to 18-years-old who received a Child Life intervention. Results: From June 2017 to July 2018, 31 CCLS saw 8,098 patients, 3,696 of which met age criteria with pre- and post-intervention cooperation data. Two hundred thirteen patients received VR with an accompanying intervention, while 34 patients received only VR. Adverse events were rare, and included increased anxiety (3.8%, n=8), dizziness (0.5%, n=1), and nausea (0.5%, n=1). Patients were more likely to be cooperative after receiving VR (99.5%, n=212) compared to pre-intervention (96.7%, n=206, p=0.041). VR use was most common in the perioperative setting (60%, n=128), followed by outpatient clinics (15%, n=32). Conclusion: VR is safe in pediatric patients with appropriate hardware, software, and patient selection. Side effects were rare and self-limited. VR appears to be associated with improvements in cooperation.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim specifically refers to the use of Augmented Reality (AR) to reduce anxiety and improve cooperation, while the reference discusses the use of Virtual Reality (VR) for similar goals. Although both technologies share overlapping objectives in pediatric care, they are distinct modalities with different implementations. Additionally, the claim extends the application to creating a supportive environment in crisis situations, which is not explicitly covered in the reference.

This highlights how the structure and function of the respiratory system are so intricately linked. The respiratory system under stress is then assessed; the five most common causes of hypoxia are explained in detail. In order to move air from the atmosphere into the lung, the mechanics of the lung and chest wall must alter throughout the ventilatory cycle.

i_2237,Contradiction,Higher Population Density: Specialists often have higher population densities and are less vulnerable to extinction due to their adaptable habitat requirements .,"Generalist species are usually widespread and abundant, and thrive in heterogeneous environments. Specialists, in turn, are generally more restricted in their range, and benefit from more stable conditions. Therefore, increasing human-induced disturbance can have more negative effects on specialist than generalist species. We assessed the specialization of 77 wood-inhabiting fungal species across seven boreal forest types and different substratum qualities. A significantly higher number of specialist species was associated with herb-rich forests and afforested fields than with managed coniferous forests and wood pastures, the number of specialists associated with natural coniferous forests being intermediate. Also, forest type specialists were indicated to be specialists for their substratum tree species as well, but specialization in substratum diameter was not connected with other kinds of specialization. Species with restricted resource or habitat preferences can less readily respond to environmental change, and therefore are more vulnerable to extinction.
[5]: Habitat specialists are declining worldwide, often paralleling rapid loss of habitat. Grassland habitats across North America are declining precipitously, due in part to intense conversion of grasslands to agriculture and rangelands, and specialist communities reliant upon this landscape are at particular risk of decline and collapse. We explored the relationship between grassland habitat specialism in birds and species population trends using several different grassland specialism indices (GSIs). Our data sources for these indices included (1) a regional bird dataset employing a spatially stratified sampling design (Integrated Monitoring of Bird Conservation Regions) of bird surveys in the Northern Great Plains of North America, and (2) geospatial data of species ranges (BirdLife Int'l) and grassland habitat (CEC North American Land Cover). We found a negative relationship between degree of habitat specialism and species population trends for all specialism metrics. We also found some evidence to support that specialism to grasslands on the wintering grounds partially explains population trends during the breeding season, giving added weight to the consideration of habitat conservation across the full annual cycle of a species to reverse or lessen population decline. Our work is the first to use quantitative methods to confirm the precarious state of grassland specialist songbirds in North America as well as demonstrate multiple methods for quantifying habitat specialism across different types of datasets.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that specialists often exhibit higher population densities and are less vulnerable to extinction because of their adaptable habitat requirements. However, the reference states that specialists are more restricted in their range, are associated with stable conditions, and, due to their limited resource or habitat preferences, are more vulnerable to extinction. This directly contradicts the claim on both counts (population density and extinction vulnerability).

This study was designed to investigate the effect of nutrition education based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) on calories, iron and folic acid intake for pregnant women. Methods: This quasi-experimental study was performed on 76 pregnant women referring to four urban health centres of Khuzestan at 2015. Two education sessions were held covering items on nutrition during pregnancy. Data were collected through a demographic questionnaire, HBM questionnaire (CVI= 0.89, CVI = 0.83 and Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and 3-day food record form. Data collection tool was valid and reliable self-administered questionnaire based on the HBM. Data analysis was done applying Chi-squared t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test using SPSS 15. Results: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean of calories, iron and folic acid intake in both groups. But after intervention, it was significant (P <0.05). Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of health belief model constructs (P > 0.05), but the difference was significant after intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Educational intervention strategies based on HBM can improve dietary iron and folic acid intake in pregnant women in primary health care setting. Since anaemia is one of the leading indirect causes of maternal mortality and it is easily preventable, our findings have critical public health implications and perhaps might be used in evidence-based decision making by authority bodies.
[8]: Pregnancy represents a challenge from a nutritional perspective, because micronutrient intake during the periconceptional period and in pregnancy affects fetal organ development and the mother's health. Inappropriate diet/nutrition in pregnancy can lead to numerous deficiencies including iron deficiency and may impair placental function and play a role in miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. This article reviews the risks associated with nutrient deficiencies in pregnant women and presents an overview of recommendations for dietary supplementation in pregnancy, focusing on oral iron supplementation. Risk factor detection, including dietary patterns and comorbidities, is paramount in optimal pregnancy management. Dietary habits, which can lead to deficiencies (e.g., iron, folate, vitamin D, and calcium) and result in negative health consequences for the mother and fetus/newborn, need to be investigated. Prenatal care should be personalized, accounting for ethnicity, culture, education, information level about pregnancy, and dietary and physical habits. Clinicians should make a plan for appropriate supplementation and prophylaxis/treatment of nutritional and other needs, and consider adequate intake of calcium, iodine, vitamin D, folate, and iron. Among the available oral iron supplements, prolonged-released ferrous sulfate (ferrous sulfate–polymeric complex) presents the lowest incidence of overall and gastrointestinal adverse events, with positive implications for compliance.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that supplementation is unnecessary because deficiencies are rarely a concern. However, the reference focuses on the importance of ensuring adequate iron (and other micronutrient) intake in pregnant women, highlighting that deficiencies are a significant risk and that appropriate supplementation or improved dietary intake is beneficial. In particular, reference [8] emphasizes the risk of iron deficiency and its negative outcomes during pregnancy, thus suggesting that supplementation is important if at risk. Therefore, the reference contradicts the claim.

i_1705,Contradiction,"Long-term studies in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary suggest that salinity, influenced by climate variability, is the primary factor determining benthic macrofaunal abundance, implying that other environmental factors are largely irrelevant to these communities .","Long-term trends in the response of benthic macrofauna to hydrological conditions were examined in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary, Texas. Four stations representing a range of salinities in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary were sampled quarterly for benthic macrofauna and hydrography from April 1988 to October 2008. The relationship between climate variability and local salinity patterns and benthic populations was investigated using the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and North Pacific Index (NPI). Mean salinity declined during the 20 yr study period. Observed changes in salinity were related to river discharge and the ONI because there were more El Niño events in the first half of the study period relative to the second half. Benthic macrofaunal abundance was significantly correlated with salinity, the ONI and the NAO, indicating that global climate variability and the resulting effects on local salinity patterns are important factors shaping benthic macrofaunal communities. There was no significant linear trend in temperature over time, and negative correlations between individual taxa and temperature were likely due to seasonality. While drivers other than physical hydrological factors can obviously affect benthic macrofaunal communities, strong connections between global climate signals, precipitation, and local salinity patterns provided the most plausible mechanistic connection between climatic variability and benthic macrofaunal response in the estuary. An increasingly unstable climate may lead to potentially strong effects in estuarine ecosystems because stability is known to affect diversity and productivity. The vulnerability of estuarine ecosystems to the effects of climate variability will be exacerbated as human population growth and water resource development continues to increase the demand for and stress on coastal and marine resources. © 2011 Inter-Research.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference shows that benthic macrofaunal abundance was significantly correlated with salinity, as well as with global climate indices (ONI and NAO), emphasizing the linkage between climate variability and local salinity patterns. It identifies physical hydrological factors as critical but also acknowledges that “drivers other than physical hydrological factors can obviously affect benthic macrofaunal communities.” This contradicts the claim’s implication that salinity is the sole or overwhelmingly dominant factor and that other environmental factors are largely irrelevant.

i_879,Unverifiable,"-  ** Broken Bubble Tunneling Effect (BBTE) ** : Bubbles can create localized areas of high current density, leading to the formation of pits or dents on the surface .","As a popular application of electrochemical anodic dissolution, electropolishing is extensively adopted in the surface finishing industries of metals. Anodic dissolution is a complex reaction with many process parameters and chemical properties involved. A simple explanation of the mechanism of morphology formation during the EP reaction is still lacking. This study examines the morphology formation of stainless steel 304 at the same location on the specimen as the process evolves. Based on these observations, the basic mechanisms of morphology formation in EP process are proposed. The bubble shielding effect (BSE) and the broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explain the raised and dented morphologies, respectively. The broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explains the formation mechanism of pitting holes and the bubbleshielding effect (BSE) explains the limitation of surface roughness of electropolishing process.

s_2040,Entailment,Taxonomic Diversity Spatial Scale Effects: The impact of land use on taxonomic diversity can vary with spatial scale. Localized changes in land use can affect species richness and composition differently than regional changes .,"Measures of functional diversity are expected to predict community responses to land use and environmental change because, in contrast to taxonomic diversity, it is based on species traits rather than their identity. Here, we investigated the impact of landscape homogenisation on plants, butterflies and birds in terms of the proportion of arable field cover in southern Finland at local (0.25 km<sup>2</sup>) and regional (> 10 000 km<sup>2</sup>) scales using four functional diversity indices: functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence and functional dispersion. No uniform response in functional diversity across taxa or scales was found. However, in all cases where we found a relationship between increasing arable field cover and any index of functional diversity, this relationship was negative. Butterfly functional richness decreased with increasing arable field cover, as did butterfly and bird functional evenness. For butterfly functional evenness, this was only evident in the most homogeneous regions. Butterfly and bird functional dispersion decreased in homogeneous regions regardless of the proportion of arable field cover locally. No effect of landscape heterogeneity on plant functional diversity was found at any spatial scale, but plant species richness decreased locally with increasing arable field cover. Overall, species richness responded more consistently to landscape homogenisation than did the functional diversity indices, with both positive and negative effects across species groups. Functional diversity indices are in theory valuable instruments for assessing effects of land use scenarios on ecosystem functioning. However, the applicability of empirical data requires deeper understanding of which traits reliably capture species' vulnerability to environmental factors and of the ecological interpretation of the functional diversity indices. Our study provides novel insights into how the functional diversity of communities changes in response to agriculturally derived landscape homogenisation; however, the low explanatory power of the functional diversity indices hampers the ability to reliably anticipate impacts on ecosystem functioning.
[5]: Aim: Changes in land use and cover (hereafter land use) affect freshwater ecosystems at different spatial scales. We tested the effects of land use on the dispersal capacity of stream macroinvertebrates through local and regional processes. Location: In all, 183 Brazilian headwater stream sites, located in the Neotropical Savanna with variable land use and covering a total area of 46,394 km<sup>2</sup>. Taxon: Stream macroinvertebrates. Methods: We used multiple regression models for distance matrices to identify the relative importance of environmental and landscape characteristics to explain community dissimilarity of stream macroinvertebrates with different mobility traits. As predictors, we calculated four distance metrics: environmental distance describing the dissimilarity in local conditions, the network distance accounting for distances across the drainage system and two distances measuring landscape resistance to dispersal (topographic and land use). We classified macroinvertebrates in dispersal groups according to their dispersal abilities (flying and drifting) and life story traits (voltinism, adult life span and body size). We tested the effects of these distances on all taxa and on the different dispersal groups, to explore whether biological traits would result in different metacommunity patterns. Results: Our hierarchical clustering analysis identified five macroinvertebrate dispersal groups. The dispersal group 1 was mainly composed by aquatic obligate taxa, dispersal group 2 by taxa with low drift propensity, dispersal group 3 represented taxa with high directional flight capacity, dispersal group 4 included taxa with medium drift propensity and dispersal group 5 represented taxa with high drift propensity. We found that environmental distance and land use distance were the most important predictors explaining community dissimilarity for most of the dispersal groups. Main conclusion: The metacommunity patterns found in this study suggest that environmental filtering was the most important community assembly mechanism at a local scale, whereas land use could constrain dispersal at the regional scale. Understanding these processes is crucial to meet conservation and restoration goals, especially in biodiversity hotspots. Our results reinforce the importance of considering entire catchments for preserving stream health and aquatic biodiversity and indicate the need for a much more integrative research between terrestrial and aquatic ecology.",Entailment,"justification: The claim focuses specifically on taxonomic diversity—its species richness and composition—and how the effects of land use differ at local versus regional scales. The reference, however, largely assesses functional diversity measures (although it does mention species richness for some taxa) rather than directly addressing taxonomic diversity itself. Moreover, the information on scale effects in the reference is derived from analyses of functional traits and, in one part, species richness, but it does not clearly differentiate or compare the impacts on localized versus regional taxonomic diversity as stated in the claim. Therefore, there is not enough directly relevant evidence in the reference to fully support the claim.

s_466,Entailment,Statistical Testing: Various testing methods are used to validate hypotheses within the space .,"The structural information in high-dimensional transposable data allows us to write the data recorded for each subject in a matrix such that both the rows and the columns correspond to variables of interest. One important problem is to test the null hypothesis that the mean matrix has a particular structure without ignoring the dependence structure among and/or between the row and column variables. To address this, we develop a generic and computationally inexpensive nonparametric testing procedure to assess the hypothesis that, in each predefined subset of columns (rows), the column (row) mean vector remains constant. In simulation studies, the proposed testing procedure seems to have good performance and, unlike simple practical approaches, it preserves the nominal size and remains powerful even if the row and/or column variables are not independent. Finally, we illustrate the use of the proposed methodology via two empirical examples from gene expression microarrays.
[4]: Biomechanical processes are often manifested as one-dimensional (1D) trajectories. It has been shown that 1D confidence intervals (CIs) are biased when based on 0D statistical procedures, and the non-parametric 1D bootstrap CI has emerged in the Biomechanics literature as a viable solution. The primary purpose of this paper was to clarify that, for 1D biomechanics datasets, the distinction between 0D and 1D methods is much more important than the distinction between parametric and non-parametric procedures. A secondary purpose was to demonstrate that a parametric equivalent to the 1D bootstrap exists in the form of a random field theory (RFT) correction for multiple comparisons. To emphasize these points we analyzed six datasets consisting of force and kinematic trajectories in one-sample, paired, two-sample and regression designs. Results showed, first, that the 1D bootstrap and other 1D non-parametric CIs were qualitatively identical to RFT CIs, and all were very different from 0D CIs. Second, 1D parametric and 1D non-parametric hypothesis testing results were qualitatively identical for all six datasets. Last, we highlight the limitations of 1D CIs by demonstrating that they are complex, design-dependent, and thus non-generalizable. These results suggest that (i) analyses of 1D data based on 0D models of randomness are generally biased unless one explicitly identifies 0D variables before the experiment, and (ii) parametric and non-parametric 1D hypothesis testing provide an unambiguous framework for analysis when one[U+05F3]s hypothesis explicitly or implicitly pertains to whole 1D trajectories.",Entailment,"justification: The reference provides detailed descriptions of different statistical testing methods in two contexts—one involving a nonparametric testing procedure for high-dimensional matrix data and another comparing 1D bootstrap-based procedures with parametric alternatives in biomechanics. Although the claim is very general, stating that various testing methods are used to validate hypotheses, the reference explicitly discusses multiple approaches for hypothesis testing in distinct settings. This information directly supports the claim.

Rural Electrification: Challenges: Issues such as staff rotation, overlapping competences, and lack of local engagement have led to project failures, which suggests that simply implementing a systems approach will likely resolve all these issues and guarantee project success and sustainability .","Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems.",Misrepresentation,"justification: While the reference acknowledges the challenges of staff rotation, overlapping competences, and lack of local engagement leading to project failures, it does not support the claim's assertion that simply implementing a systems approach will resolve all these issues and guarantee project success and sustainability.

Material and methods: The study group consisted of 210 women aged 45 to 65, not using hormone replacement therapy, staying at healthcare centers for rehabilitation treatment. The study was carried out in 2013-2014 in the Silesian, Podlaskie and Lesser Poland voivodeships. The set of tools consisted of the authors' own survey questionnaire and the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS). Results: The most commonly occurring symptom in the group of studied women was a depressive mood, from the group of psychological symptoms, followed by physical and mental fatigue, and discomfort connected with muscle and joint pain. The greatest intensity of symptoms was observed in the group of women with the lowest level of education, reporting an average or bad material situation, and unemployed women. Conclusions: An alarmingly high number of reported psychological symptoms in the group of menopausal women was observed, and in particular among the group of low socio-economic status. Career seems to be a factor reducing the risk of occurrence of psychological symptoms. There is an urgent need for health promotion and prophylaxis in the group of menopausal women, and in many cases for implementation of specialist psychological assistance.
[8]: Objectives Previous studies have found that women with premature menopause often report fertility problems, menopause symptoms and negative experiences of medical services. This study aims to measure the prevalence of these problems and explore whether they have negative impacts on psychosocial adjustment (symptom experience and quality of life). Methods A cross-sectional survey was mailed to women who had been diagnosed with premature menopause, recruited from hospital clinics in West London and from a patient support website (the Daisy Network). The survey measured participant characteristics, fertility problems, hot flushes and night sweats, experience of diagnosis, patient satisfaction with medical services, the Women's Health Questionnaire and the General Health Survey SF-36. Responses were described and multiple linear regressions were used to explore predictors of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Results A total of 136 women were included in the analysis. Psychosocial functioning was relatively poor compared to typical aged menopausal women. Fertility concerns were prevalent (reported by 71% of the sample), 35% reported experiencing hot flushes and/or nights sweats, and, on average, women were neither satisfied nor unsatisfied with medical services (mean = 3.00, standard deviation = 0.98). Age, experiencing hot flushes and/or night sweats and patient satisfaction predicted psychosocial functioning, but only explained a small amount of the variance (311%). Conclusions Women with premature menopause would benefit from interventions that improve psychosocial functioning and quality of life, including improving patient experience and effective treatment of menopause symptoms.

Rapid weight loss with very-low-calorie diet (VLCD) is known to improve insulin sensitivity and decrease adipose tissue masses.

Sixteen healthy obese (body mass index 33±1.1 kg/m2) subjects underwent VLCD for 6 weeks. RGU and perfusion were measured using [18F]-fluoro-deoxy-glucose, [15O]H2O and positron emission tomography. Results. Blood-flow and rGU expressed per gram of adipose tissue were higher in visceral fat compared to abdominal subcutaneous fat (P<0.01 for both). Dieting decreased weight by 11±0.9 kg (P<0.0001). Visceral adipose fat decreased by 25% (P<0.001) and abdominal subcutaneous fat by 16% (P<0.001).

The impellers are made from difficult-to-cut titanium or nickel alloys, and the blades must be machined within tight tolerances. As a consequence, deflections of the tool and flexible workpiece can jeopardize the precision of the impellers during milling. This work is the first of a two part paper on cutting force prediction and feed optimization for the five-axis flank milling of an impeller. In Part I, a mathematical model for predicting cutting forces is presented for five-axis machining with tapered, helical, ball-end mills with variable pitch and serrated flutes. The cutter is divided axially into a number of differential elements, each with its own feed coordinate system due to five-axis motion. At each element, the total velocity due to translation and rotation is split into horizontal and vertical feed components, which are used to calculate total chip thickness along the cutting edge. The cutting forces for each element are calculated by transforming friction angle, shear stress and shear angle from an orthogonal cutting database to the oblique cutting plane. The distributed cutting load is digitally summed to obtain the total forces acting on the cutter and blade.

An association with oral moxifloxacin is reported in some articles. We describe one case of bilateral acute iris transillumination, following the use of systemic moxifloxacin.
[2]: Antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are commonly used to treat ocular infections but are also known to cause dermal melanocyte toxicity. The release of dispersed pigments from the iris into the aqueous humor has been considered a possible ocular side effect of the systemic administration of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin, and this condition is known as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT). Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris (BADI) is a similar condition, with iris pigment released into the aqueous, but it has not been reported as a side effect of FQL. Iris pigments are synthesized by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) and can be detected but not quantified by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The correlation between dispersed pigments in the aqueous and the extent of melanocyte toxicity due to topical antibiotics in vivo is not well studied. Here, we aimed to study the effect of topical FQLs on iris tissue, the pigment release in the aqueous humor and the development of clinically evident iris atrophic changes. We evaluated this process by measuring the activity of TYR in the aqueous humor of 82 healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery following topical application of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin (27 eyes, preservative-free) or Ciprofloxacin (29 eyes, with preservative) or the application of non-FQL Tobramycin (26 eyes, with preservative) as a control. In addition, the patients were questioned and examined for ocular side effects in pre- and post-operative periods. Our data showed a significantly higher mean TYR activity in the aqueous humor of Ciprofloxacin-treated eyes compared to Moxifloxacin- (preservative free, p < 0.0001) or Tobramycin-treated eyes (p < 0.0001), which indicated that few quinolones under certain conditions are toxic to the iris melanocytes. However, the reduced TYR activity in the aqueous of Moxifloxacin-treated eyes was possibly due to the presence of a higher drug concentration, which inhibits TYR activity. Consistently, immunoblotting analysis of the aqueous humor from both Ciprofloxacin- and Moxifloxacin-treated eyes showed the presence of soluble TYR enzyme, thus reflecting its toxicity to iris melanocytes and corresponding to its activity in the aqueous humor. Intriguingly, none of these patients developed any clinically appreciable ocular side effects characteristic of BAIT or BADI. Overall, our results suggest that topical antibiotics cause different levels of iris melanocyte toxicity, releasing dispersed pigments into the aqueous humor, which can be measured through TYR enzyme activity. Hence, we conclude that topical FQLs may cause subclinical toxicity to the iris melanocytes but may not be the sole cause of the development of BAIT or BADI.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that systemic ciprofloxacin is associated with BAIT, while the reference clearly reports an association with systemic moxifloxacin, not ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the experimental data in the reference regarding ciprofloxacin pertains to a topical application that did not result in clinically evident BAIT.

i_1778,Contradiction,Key Components of Sustainable Environmental Management: Resilience and Adaptive Governance: Resilience: Suggests that social-ecological systems can always adapt and thrive without considering the potential limitations or failures in their capacity to do so .,"Since the late 1980s, the idea of sustainable development has been gaining widespread recognition as a guiding framework for policies on development and the environment. However, the concept of sustainable development has received a number of criticisms, including its over-emphasis on meeting human needs through economic growth, as well as its failure to recognize dynamic human–environment interactions. In response to these shortfalls, the concepts of resilience and adaptive governance have emerged as alternative perspectives for pursuing sustainable development. Resilience in social-ecological systems emphasizes the capacity of coupled human–environment systems to deal with change, while continuing to develop. Adaptive governance relies on diverse and nested institutional mechanisms for connecting actors across multiple scales to manage conflicts and uncertainties in ecosystem management processes. However, the ethical dimensions of resilience and adaptive governance have not received enough attention. A promising ethical perspective for guiding policies on human–environment interactions is the philosophy of deep ecology, which highlights the need for recognition of the intrinsic values of all living things, as well as the nurturing of ecological and cultural diversity. In this paper, I argue that an integration of the principles of deep ecology and adaptive governance provides a complementary set of ethical principles and institutional attributes that offers better prospects for pursuing sustainable development in the era of the Anthropocene.

Distributing applications on multiple clouds has a number of benefits, but absence of a common multi-cloud management platform that would allow ASPs dynamic and real time control over resources across multiple clouds and interconnecting networks makes this task arduous. Open application delivery network (OpenADN), a multi-cloud management and control platform, fills this gap. However, performance issues of such a complex, distributed and multi-threaded platform, not tackled appropriately, may neutralise some of the gains accruable to the ASPs.

Optimization of VLSI Design: Swarm Intelligence (SI) Algorithms: SI-based algorithms like the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm have shown effectiveness in optimizing VLSI design parameters such as interconnect wirelength, which is crucial for reducing transmission delays within chips .","Swarm Intelligence (SI), modelled upon the behaviours of various swarms of animals and insects such as ants, termites, bees, birds, fishes, fireflies, etc. is an emerging area in the field of optimization. SI based algorithms are proclaimed to be robust and efficient optimization tools. This fact is corroborated by a number of practical engineering problems where these algorithms give very satisfactory results. Nowadays VLSI Design has become one of the most intriguing and fervent research field for engineers. Efficient development of a system of a billion chips and blocks on a printed circuit board requires extensive use of optimization in various areas of design such as chip size, separation among components, interconnect length etc. One of the most significant among these is the interconnect wirelength, which determines the overall delay in transmission within the chip. The routing phase in the VLSI Physical Design strives to optimize the interconnect length. Several studies have been and are being conducted to improve the performance of VLSI chips by optimally interconnecting the various components. Various SI based algorithms have already proved their efficiency in this field of routing optimization. In this paper we have proposed a global routing scheme based on contemporary SI algorithms: Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and have compared the performance of the two. FA produces superior optimization results in comparison to ABC although proving to be quite expensive, computationally. © 2014 IEEE.",Missing information,"justification: The reference explains that SI-based algorithms have proven effective in optimizing VLSI design parameters, specifically noting that these algorithms are used in global routing to optimize interconnect wirelength—the same parameter mentioned in the claim as crucial for reducing transmission delays.

s_1518,Entailment,"Food-Processing By-Products: By-products such as edible oil cakes (e.g. groundnut, coconut, and sesame oil cakes) are used as substrates due to their nutrient richness. These substrates support the growth of fungi and the production of enzymes necessary for mycoprotein synthesis .","Background: Amylases produced by fungi during solid-state fermentation are the most widely used commercial enzymes to meet the ever-increasing demands of the global enzyme market. The use of low-cost substrates to curtail the production cost and reuse solid wastes are seen as viable options for the commercial production of many enzymes. Applications of α-amylases in food, feed, and industrial sectors have increased over the years. Additionally, the demand for processed and ready-to-eat food has increased because of the rapid growth of food-processing industries in developing economies. These factors significantly contribute to the global enzyme market. It is estimated that by the end of 2024, the global α-amylase market would reach USD 320.1 million (Grand View Research Inc., 2016). We produced α-amylase using Aspergillus oryzae and low-cost substrates obtained from edible oil cake, such as groundnut oil cake (GOC), coconut oil cake (COC), sesame oil cake (SOC) by solid-state fermentation. We cultivated the fungus using these nutrient-rich substrates to produce the enzyme. The enzyme was extracted, partially purified, and tested for pH and temperature stability. The effect of pH, incubation period and temperature on α-amylase production using A. oryzae was optimized. Box–Behnken design (BBD) of response surface methodology (RSM) was used to optimize and determine the effects of all process parameters on α-amylase production. The overall cost economics of α-amylase production using a pilot-scale fermenter was also studied. Results: The substrate optimization for α-amylase production by the Box–Behnken design of RSM showed GOC as the most suitable substrate for A. oryzae, as evident from its maximum α-amylase production of 9868.12 U/gds. Further optimization of process parameters showed that the initial moisture content of 64%, pH of 4.5, incubation period of 108 h, and temperature of 32.5 °C are optimum conditions for α-amylase production. The production increased by 11.4% (10,994.74 U/gds) by up-scaling and using optimized conditions in a pilot-scale fermenter. The partially purified α-amylase exhibited maximum stability at a pH of 6.0 and a temperature of 55 °C. The overall cost economic studies showed that the partially purified α-amylase could be produced at the rate of Rs. 622/L. Conclusions: The process parameters for enhanced α-amylase secretion were analyzed using 3D contour plots by RSM, which showed that contour lines were more oriented toward incubation temperature and pH, having a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the α-amylase activity. The optimized parameters were subsequently employed in a 600 L-pilot-scale fermenter for the α-amylase production. The substrates were rich in nutrients, and supplementation of nutrients was not required. Thus, we have suggested an economically viable process of α-amylase production using a pilot-scale fermenter.",Entailment,"justification: The reference does indicate that edible oil cakes (groundnut, coconut, sesame) are nutrient‐rich substrates used to cultivate fungi (A. oryzae) and to produce an enzyme (α‐amylase).

For instance, the predominant bacteria in Hausa koko fermentation include Lactobacillus species, which are known for their probiotic benefits .","Hausa koko is an indigenous porridge processed from millet in Ghana. The process involves fermentation stages, giving the characteristic organoleptic properties of the product that is produced largely at a small-scale household level and sold as a street food. Like many other indigenous foods, quality control is problematic and depends on the skills of the processor. In order to improve the quality of the product and standardize the process for large-scale production, we need a deeper understanding of the microbial processes. The aim of this study is to investigate the microbial community involved in the production of this traditional millet porridge and the metabolites produced during processing. High-throughput amplicon sequencing was used to identify the bacterial (16S rRNA V4 hypervariable region) and fungal [Intergenic Transcribed Spacer (ITS)] communities associated with the fermentation, while nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was used for metabolite profiling. The bacterial community diversity was reduced during the fermentation processes with an increase and predominance of lactobacilli. Other dominant bacteria in the fermentation included Pediococcus, Weissella, Lactococcus, Streptococcus, Leuconostoc, and Acetobacter. The species Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Ligilactobacillus salivarius accounted for some of the diversities within and between fermentation time points and processors.

Batch ruminal cultures were established with one of various feedstuffs or with a fescue hay-based diet and ruminal fluid from a heifer fed a 40% forage:60% concentrate diet. Addition of xylanase at 135 xylanase units (XU) per ml increased total VFA production from the fescue hay-based diet (44.3 vs. 57.2 mM, p < 0.05) without changing the acetate to propionate (A:P) ratio.

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our registry to identify all patients who had been followed for at least two years after a metal-on-metal hip resurfacing arthroplasty, and we divided those patients according to whether they had had a body mass index of ≥30 (the study group) or <30 (the control group) at the time of the surgery. One hundred and twenty-five patients (144 hips) with an average weight of 104.6 kg and an average body mass index of 33.4 were included in the study group, and 531 patients (626 hips) with an average weight of 78.3 kg and an average body mass index of 25.4 were included in the control group. We compared the clinical results (UCLA [University of California at Los Angeles] and Harris hip scores, SF-12 [Short Form-12] survey results, and complication rates), radiographic results, and prosthetic survival rates of the two groups. Results: There was no significant difference postoperatively between the groups with regard to the UCLA pain or walking scores or the mental component score of the SF-12. However, the UCLA function and activity scores were lower in the study group than in the control group (9.2 compared with 9.6 points [p = 0.001] and 7.1 compared with 7.6 points [p = 0.002], respectively). The control group had a significantly higher postoperative physical component score on the SF-12 (51.4 points compared with 49.3 points in the study group, p = 0.01) and postoperative Harris hip score (93.8 compared with 90.6 points, p = 0.0003). Two hips (1.4%) were revised in the study group. In contrast, thirty-one hips (5.0%) were converted to a total hip replacement in the control group; twenty of the thirty-one were revised because of loosening of the femoral component. The five-year survivorship of the hip prostheses was 98.6% in the study group and 93.6% in the control group (p = 0.0401). When the entire cohort was divided into three groups according to whether the body mass index was <25, 25 to 29, or ≥30, the risk of revision was found to have decreased twofold from one group to the next as the body mass index increased (p = 0.013). No acetabular component loosened in either group. The average diameter of the femoral component was 48.3 mm in the study group and 46.8 mm in the control group (p = 0.0001). There were no revisions for any reason and no radiolucencies were observed in a subset of twenty-seven patients with a body mass index of ≥35. Conclusions: Metal-on-metal resurfacing hip arthroplasty is performing well in patients with a high body mass index, although the function scores are reduced compared with those for patients with a body mass index of <30.

[3]: Joint replacement is an extremely successful orthopaedic procedure, commonly resulting in pain relief and activity recovery. However, it is recognised that, in the longer term, polyethylene (PE) wear particles generated at the articulating surfaces lead to chronic inflammatory tissue reactions, osteolysis and loosening of the prostheses. PE wear is a multi-factorial phenomenon influenced by some patient- related factors, such as gender, age, activity level and weight. In hip arthroplasty, femoral head size and composition and PE quality and configuration are also related to wear. Surgical technique can also influence PE wear, because increased contact stress between the articular surfaces can be reduced by accurate component positioning. Regarding knee arthroplasty, many structural and design factors related to the PE bearing surface have been shown to affect the extent of wear that occurs over time (e.g. PE processing, manufacturing and sterilization methods). Selecting a well-designed component with minimal counter surface roughness is also important in minimizing the generation of PE wear debris and subsequent osteolysis. This chapter describes current knowledge of the influence of surgical technique on total hip and knee arthroplasty. © 2013 Woodhead Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.",Entailment,"justification: The reference provides two separate pieces of information that, when combined, support the claim’s reasoning. First, one section explains that polyethylene wear particles lead to inflammatory tissue reactions while also stating that patient-related factors—such as activity level and weight—affect wear. Second, the study on hip arthroplasty shows that patients with a higher body mass index had lower activity scores (suggesting reduced activity) and a trade-off in functionality, which is consistent with the claim’s idea that higher body weight may lead to reduced wear due to lower physical activity but at the expense of function. Although the reference does not explicitly state “inflammatory response” being directly modulated by body weight and activity, it provides the basis (i.e., factors influencing wear and subsequent inflammatory reactions) that underpins the claim.

s_1930,Entailment,The need for cryogenic trapping and focusing of CO₂ between instruments adds to the complexity and potential for error in the analysis process .,"Stable carbon isotopes are a powerful tool to assess the origin and dynamics of carbon in soils. However, direct analysis of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool has proved to be difficult. Recently, several systems have been developed to measure isotope ratios in DOC by coupling a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. However these systems were designed for the analysis of fresh and marine water and no results for soil solutions or <sup>13</sup>C-enriched samples have been reported. Because we mainly deal with soil solutions in which the difficult to oxidize humic and fulvic acids are the predominant carbon-containing components, we preferred to use thermal catalytic oxidation to convert DOC into CO<inf>2</inf>.

The analytical performance was tested by measuring solutions of compounds varying in the ease with which they can be oxidized.

s_2118,Entailment,Factors Influencing N₂O Emissions: Dissolved Oxygen (DO) Levels: High DO levels can decrease N₂O emissions by promoting complete nitrification and denitrification .,"Nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) is an important pollutant which is emitted during the biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes of wastewater treatment. Since it has a greenhouse effect which is 265 times higher than carbon dioxide, even relatively small amounts can result in a significant carbon footprint. Biological nitrogen (N) removal conventionally occurs with nitrification/denitrification, yet also through advanced processes such as nitritation/denitritation and completely autotrophic N-removal. The microbial pathways leading to the N<inf>2</inf>O emission include hydroxylamine oxidation and nitrifier denitrification, both activated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria, and heterotrophic denitrification. In this work, a critical review of the existing literature on N<inf>2</inf>O emissions during BNR is presented focusing on the most contributing parameters. Various factors increasing the N<inf>2</inf>O emissions either per se or combined are identified: low dissolved oxygen, high nitrite accumulation, low chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratio, slow growth of denitrifying bacteria, uncontrolled pH and temperature. However, there is no common pattern in reporting the N<inf>2</inf>O generation amongst the cited studies, a fact that complicates its evaluation. When simulating N<inf>2</inf>O emissions, all microbial pathways along with the potential contribution of abiotic N<inf>2</inf>O production during wastewater treatment at different dissolved oxygen/nitrite levels should be considered. The undeniable validation of the robustness of such models calls for reliable quantification techniques which simultaneously describe dissolved and gaseous N<inf>2</inf>O dynamics. Thus, the choice of the N-removal process, the optimal selection of operational parameters and the establishment of validated dynamic models combining multiple N<inf>2</inf>O pathways are essential for studying the emissions mitigation.
[3]: Nitrous oxide (N <inf>2</inf> O) is an important greenhouse gas that can be emitted from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Such emissions are reportedly process specific and related to operational parameters. This study was conducted to clarify spatial and daily variations of N <inf>2</inf> O in a full-scale activated sludge anoxic/oxic process that consisted of an anoxic tank and three oxic tanks (oxic-1, oxic-2 and oxic-3), all of which except the final sedimentation tank were fully covered. Higher dissolved N <inf>2</inf> O (D-N <inf>2</inf> O) loading and gaseous N <inf>2</inf> O (G-N <inf>2</inf> O) emissions were observed for oxic-3 than for the anoxic, oxic-1, and oxic-2 tanks, implying that there was higher N <inf>2</inf> O production potential via nitrification in the latter stage of the oxic tank. Moreover, the sudden decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration after the peak was found to lead to abrupt production of D-N <inf>2</inf> O at oxic-3 in the anoxic/oxic process. The increases in AOB amoA, AOB nirK and the following AOB norB gene transcripts at the end of the oxic-2 tank suggested that nitrifier denitrification occurred to produce N <inf>2</inf> O under low dissolved oxygen conditions when the N <inf>2</inf> O peak was observed. Additionally, the much lower transcription levels of the two nosZ genes suggested lower N <inf>2</inf> O consumption. The N <inf>2</inf> O emission factors ranged from 0.087% to 0.302%, and lower N <inf>2</inf> O emission factors were observed during summer.
[7]: Substantial amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG) have been demonstrated to be emitted in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). One of the GHG with a great influence is nitrous oxide (N2O), which is emitted during the nitrification and denitrification processes in a biological wastewater treatment. This paper proposes the implementation of a control strategy in order to reduce N2O emissions in the nitrification process. Due to the fact that N2O emissions are produced as an intermediate in the nitrification process, the idea of the present work is based on the implementation of a nitrite control by manipulating dissolved oxygen (So) in order to avoid partial nitrification and thus to reduce N2O peaks. A hierarchical control strategy is proposed, where the higher level is composed of an affine function and the lower level of a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller. A modified version of Benchmark Simulation Model 2 (BSM2G) that includes GHG emissions is used for the evaluation. The simulation results show that the proposed control strategy achieve the reduction of GHG emissions by reducing N2O. However, additional control strategies must also be implemented to take into account the other evaluation criteria of the plant.",Entailment,"justification: The reference indicates that low dissolved oxygen levels increase N₂O emissions, implying that higher DO levels would have the opposite effect. In addition, one of the studies [7] discusses using DO control to avoid conditions (partial nitrification) that lead to N₂O peaks, which aligns with the claim that high DO promotes complete nitrification (and implicitly, appropriate denitrification) to mitigate emissions. Thus, the reference supports the claim that high DO can decrease N₂O emissions.

Detection of traffic violations such as illegal turns and identification of pedestrians, vehicles from traffic videos can be done by using computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. Object detection is the process of identifying instances of real world objects which include persons, faces and vehicles in images or videos. Object detection is becoming an increasingly important challenge now days as it has so many applications. Vehicle detection helps in core detection of multiple functions such as Adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning. Automatic Generation of Traffic Signal based on Traffic Volume system can be used for traffic control. Traffic Surveillance videos of vehicles are taken as input from MIT Traffic dataset. These videos are further processed frame by frame where the background subtraction is done with the help of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). From the background subtracted result some amount of noise is removed with the help of Morphological opening operation and Blob analysis is done in order to the detect the vehicles. Later the vehicles are counted by incrementing the counter whenever a bounding box is appeared for the detected vehicle. Finally a signal is generated depending on the count in each frame.

During dry seasons, reduced precipitation leads to lower soil moisture, which in turn reduces NDVI. Studies have shown that NDVI values are positively correlated with precipitation levels, meaning that less rainfall results in lower NDVI values .","Precipitation is one of the important factors that influences vegetation growth and distributions. Using GF-1 remotely sensed images and observed precipitation data, this paper discusses the response relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) in Hutubi County at different time scales from January to December, 2014. The results show that: (1) From a macro point of view, NDVI has obvious geographical characteristics, the Central Plains region has the highest NDVI values; whereas mountains and hills in the southern region and deserts in the northern region have relatively low NDVI values. (2) There is a clear changing trend in the area of vegetation cover. (3) The SPI randomness decreases but the SPI persistence increases with increment in time scales. The sensitivity of the SPI to precipitation is different at different time scales. (4) The SPI has a good correlation with NDVI at six-months time scale. (5)The overall distributions of both basically have the same shape and trendwithhigher SPI values in April and May, and higher NDVI are from June to August. This confirms the lag-time of precipitation influence on vegetation.
[4]: Changes in precipitation patterns were expected to have strong impacts on temperate ecosystem dynamics. North China has experienced opposite trends of precipitation change (increased in the west and decreased in the east) in the past several decades.

The results showed that in mean GS NDVI increased for grasslands in both Northeastern China (NE) and Northwestern China (NW). Increase in NDVI in NW was mainly due to the increase in precipitation (r = 0.50, p < 0.01). However, the decrease in precipitation did not cause a decrease in grass NDVI in NE, suggesting that precipitation is still higher than the most sensitive value and NDVI changes were significantly correlated with the increased temperature (r = 0.43, p < 0.05).",Entailment,"justification: The claim specifically states that during dry seasons, reduced precipitation lowers soil moisture and thus decreases NDVI and asserts that NDVI is positively correlated with precipitation.

Objective: This study evaluates the wound healing activity of NXT by employing an excisional wound splinting model. Materials and methods: NXT was dissolved in saline and given daily by gavage. Wounds were induced at the dorsum of non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and treated with saline or 700 mg/kg/d NXT for 16 days. Wound closure was measured every four days.

It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. However, other, rare phenotypes have also been described. There are many differential diagnoses of the short, syndromic child, including chromosomal, single gene, and multifactorial causes. However, one condition of particular relevance in the context of this report is the Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). As originally described, the RSS is a very specific condition. However, it has subsequently become an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of conditions presenting with short stature and triangular shape to the face. A significant proportion of these are now believed to be due to imprinting defects at 11p15. However, the cause in many cases remains unknown. We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between OI and RSS who both have COL1A1 mutations.

In addition to its primary effect on the skeletal system, the alterations in connective tissue may affect several extraskeletal structures, such as the cardiovascular system, sclera, middle and inner ear, tendons/ligaments, central nervous system, and teeth. Patients with osteogenesis imperfecta also have a greater incidence of airway anomalies, thoracic anatomy abnormalities, coagulation dysfunction, hyperthyroidism, and an increased tendency to develop perioperative hyperthermia. Given the multisystem involvement of osteogenesis imperfecta, several issues exist that may impact the perioperative management of these patients. Of particular concern are the associated cardiovascular anomalies, increased incidence of perioperative bleeding, easily fractured bones and teeth, airway anomalies, the tendency to develop intraoperative hyperthermia, and hyperthyroidism.",Entity error,"justification: The reference primarily discusses osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and its characteristics, including the increased risk of fractures due to defects in type I collagen, and it briefly mentions that similar collagen defects can be seen in some Ehlers‐Danlos syndrome (EDS) subtypes. However, the claim specifically addresses women with EDS having a higher fracture risk due to connective tissue fragility, and the reference does not provide explicit information or data regarding fracture risk in EDS patients. Therefore, there is not enough information in the reference to confirm or align with the claim.

i_819,Unverifiable,Push Systems: Inventory Levels: These systems often result in higher inventory levels to buffer against demand variability and lead time changes. This can lead to increased holding costs and potential overproduction .,"Various ways to combat push inventory systems, which rely on forecasts for scheduling, such as pull systems and replenishment are discussed. A pull system generates production orders based on actual consumption and creates a tight supply chain with minimal inventory exposure. The pull systems have little capacity to absorb variability from fluctuating demand, lead time changes, or seasonality. The replenishment system, which is a combination of push and pull, uses forecasts for sizing inventory buffers and pull signals for replenishment. The replenishment can be implemented with any enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that has maximum/minimum settings. The buffer is broken up into three zones, which includes a fully intact green buffer, yellow which needs attention, and red which must be expedited. The ERP maximum/minimum is used to help generate demand by setting the 'max' at full buffer and the 'min' at yellow to recorder.
[2]: Logistics or supply chains play a central role in effective management. Inventory control systems play a significant role in managing supply chains. This article provides engineering managers with guidelines to choose a cost-effective supply chain inventory control system through analyzing push inventory systems (MRP), and pull systems (JIT). Simulation modeling was used to build and analyze the supply chains with stationary and cyclical demand patterns. The article indicates the main variables that should concern the engineering manager to choose between MRP and JIT. The paper concludes that because JIT reduces the holding cost, it becomes a more cost-effective system at a wider range as the demand level increases. The results also show that when information is shared across a supply chain that implements a MRP system, the cost reduction is significant in comparison with no information sharing especially under cyclical and highly variable demand patterns. © 2006 by the American Society for Engineering Management.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that push systems result in higher inventory levels to buffer against demand variability and lead time changes, which in turn increases holding costs and may lead to overproduction. The reference discusses push inventory systems that rely on forecasts and the need for inventory buffers, and it contrasts these with pull systems that minimize inventory exposure. It also addresses the higher holding costs associated with push systems relative to pull systems. Although the reference does not explicitly use the word “overproduction,” the description of using forecasts to size inventory buffers and the discussion regarding higher holding costs imply the same drawbacks mentioned in the claim. Therefore, the reference supports the claim.

s_1840,Contradiction,Community-Level Strategies: Public Education and Awareness: Continuous public education and awareness campaigns are crucial. Informing residents about the environmental benefits of recycling and the importance of reducing landfill use can positively influence their attitudes and behaviors .,"[3] Two different strategies aiming at increasing household source-separation of food waste were assessed through a case-study in a Swedish residential area (a) use of written information, distributed as leaflets amongst households and (b) installation of equipment for source-segregation of waste with the aim of increasing convenience food waste sorting in kitchens. Weightings of separately collected food waste before and after distribution of written information suggest that this resulted in neither a significant increased amount of separately collected food waste, nor an increased source-separation ratio. After installation of sorting equipment in households, both the amount of separately collected food waste as well as the source-separation ratio increased vastly. Long-term monitoring shows that results where longstanding. Results emphasize the importance of convenience and existence of infrastructure necessary for source-segregation of waste as important factors for household waste recycling, but also highlight the need of addressing these aspects where waste is generated, i.e. already inside the household. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. [11] An empirical investigation assessed the role of different factors of motivational, behavioral, and dispositional nature in the prediction of both perceived and actual skills concerning household waste recycling. A structured questionnaire (measuring attitudes, social norms, perceived control, need for cognitive closure, self-reported household recycling behavior and perceived recycling skills) and a simulation task (assessing actual recycling skills) were administered to 300 participants in Italy. Results indicate that, although positively related, perceived and actual skills are two distinct constructs differently related to motivational, behavioral, and dispositional factors. Implications for designing educational interventions to increase citizens' recycling skills are discussed.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that continuous public education and awareness campaigns are crucial for positively influencing residents’ attitudes and behaviors regarding recycling. However, the reference describes a study where written information—essentially a public education campaign via leaflets—did not result in a significant increase in household source-separation of food waste. Moreover, while the reference also discusses the role of infrastructure and other factors in waste recycling, it does not provide support for the effectiveness of public education or awareness campaigns in achieving the intended behavioral changes. Therefore, the evidence provided contradicts the claim.

The Mallory-Weiss syndrome causes 5-15% of all cases of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Affected individuals are mostly middle-aged men with a history of alcohol consumption. Endoscopic finding of longitudinal lacerations, predominantly on the right esophageal wall and cardia, confirms the diagnosis. In most cases the bleeding stops spontaneously. Elderly patients or those with comorbidities often require endoscopic treatment such as epinephrine injection therapy, electrocoagulation, hemoclip placement or endoscopic band ligation to stop the bleeding. Only one or a combination of the several mentioned methods can be applied. Predictive factors for rebleeding are shock at initial presentation, active bleeding at initial endoscopy, coagulopathy and low hematocrit. Considered that bleeding Mallory-Weiss tears often present themselves in elderly patients with comorbidities, the risk for an unfavorable outcome is the same as in bleeding peptic ulcer and the mortality rate is around 5%.",Entailment,"justification: The reference states that signs of hypovolemic shock (syncope, tachycardia, and hypotension) occur in ""more severe cases"" of Mallory-Weiss syndrome, not in every case of the condition. The claim, however, implies that these shock signs are common in all patients with Mallory-Weiss syndrome, even though it specifies ""severe cases"" first.

i_2240,Contradiction,"Population Dynamics: Generalists tend to maintain stable populations even in fluctuating environments, as seen in species like the starling .","The small variability of habitat generalist abundances in relation to landscape changes has been related to their behavioural flexibility. We hypothesise that successful generalists, such as the starling, compensate for feeding resource difficulties (poor quality of food, accessibility) in habitats such as urban ecosystems and that its behavioural flexibility allows for similar breeding performance in rural and urban areas. Along an urbanisation gradient we compared simultaneously (1) success factors such as the abundance of breeding starlings, their breeding performance and the fitness of nestlings, and (2) possible flexibility quantified through the rate of parental food-provisioning, and the composition and the amount of food delivered to nestlings. Abundance of breeding starlings are similar throughout the urbanisation gradient, but urbanisation profoundly and negatively affects reproductive parameters of starlings. Differences in the amount of food delivered to nestlings by parents (less food in town centre), and the small masses of nestlings reared in the urban sectors support the idea that urban nestlings received insufficient food loads. Despite modifications to their diurnal food-provisioning rhythm and the incorporation of some human food refuse into their diet, starling parents have a significantly reduced production of young in the urban centre sector. We rebut the idea that the ""generalist"" starling is able to breed successfully anywhere: other more ""specialist"" species succeed in producing their young by innovating more in terms of diet resources.

In addition to their principal role of directing sexual differentiation and reproduction, they also regulate the bone growth spurts of puberty, and they maintain bone mass throughout life. The biological importance of sex steroid hormones on bone remodeling is well demonstrated by the fact that gonadal failure and sex steroid deficiencies are major pathogenic factors in the development of bone loss. Estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, and androgen loss as part of the aging process in elderly men, or after therapy for prostate cancer, leads to a decline in bone mass, and markedly increases the risk of osteoporosis. Sex steroids act to regulate bone turnover, at least in part, via bone cells, through high-affinity estrogen or androgen receptors.

A number of mechanisms are developed to provide the gripping like adaptive grasp system, cross four bar mechanism, six axis Southampton mechanism one way lock, variable force transmission mechanism, and six bar chain mechanism. The disadvantages of the present prosthetic hands are high weight of hand, backlash in the joint, poor function, noise, and less cosmetic appearance.

Therefore, our objective was to investigate the short-term effects of MPs pollution on soil microorganisms in two agricultural soils with contrasting soil organic matter content and microbial biomass as caused by farm management history (organic and conventional). Soils were amended with two kinds of raw MPs particles, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) in the size range of 200–630 μm at a rate of 1% w/w and incubated for 28 days. During incubation, microbial respiration was determined. After incubation, the microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), gene copy numbers of archaea, bacteria and fungi were quantified and extractions performed to gauge effects on C and N mineralisation. The results of this study showed no major detrimental effects of MPs on microbial activity. However, in particular PP reduced microbial biomass in both soils, with a stronger decline in the organic soil, showing lower resistance to MPs. Nevertheless, mineralisation processes remained on the same level, showing functional resistance of the microbial community to MPs addition in both soils. The microbial community composition was not significantly altered by MPs addition, even though fungi tended to decrease in the organic soil. Overall, management legacy had a stronger effect on soil microorganisms, with higher microbial biomass and activity in the organic soil.

s_1118,Entailment,4. : Changes in muscle electrical resistance during contraction can be associated with muscle morphology and metabolic processes. Measuring these changes can provide additional information on the impact of adhesions .,"Changes in skeletal muscle electrical resistance during muscle contraction may be associated to two main factors. Changes at muscle morphology e.g. length, volume or cross-sectional area; and changes in its impeditivity, related to changes of biochemical and physiological processes during muscle activity. However, the mechanisms by both morphological or metabolic parameters and, more importantly, if they increase or decrease electrical impedance parameters is yet controversial. The present study aimed to investigate the behavior of the muscular electrical resistance of the gastrocnemius muscle of Wistar rats during muscle contraction at different levels of force. To address that, tetrapolar invasive needle electrodes were placed in the animal muscle for impedance measurement, while two other needles electrodes were placed on muscle ends to electrical stimulate the muscle and evoke contraction. The experimental protocol consisted of ten pulse trains with 1 s duration with 40 s rest using randomized frequencies. All the procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee for Research with Animals under the decision number 019/15. Results show a decrease on muscle resistance during contraction. It was observed a correlation of r = −0.76 between the intensity of muscle contraction and resistance changes. Our findings suggest that resistance decrease is expected for invasive measurements in healthy muscles.

Muscle contraction was induced via monophasic current pulse stimulation of the sciatic nerve. Simultaneously, multisine EIM (1 kHz to 1 MHz) and force measurements of the muscle were performed. Stimulation was applied at three different rates to produce mild, moderate, and strong contractions. We identified changes in both single and multifrequency data, as assessed by the Cole impedance model parameters. The processes of contraction and relaxation were clearly identified in the impedance spectra and quantified via derivative plots. Reductions in the center frequency f<inf>c</inf> were observed during the contraction consistent with the increasing muscle fiber diameter. Different EIM stimulation rate-dependencies were also detected across the three groups of animals.",Entailment,"Justification: While the reference supports the idea that changes in muscle electrical resistance during contraction are associated with changes in muscle morphology and metabolic processes, it does not mention measuring these changes to provide information on the impact of adhesions. The part of the claim regarding adhesions is not addressed or supported in the reference.

A myoelectric signal is used to enable a servo motor movement which permits opening and closing the prosthesis. The prosthesis force is controlled with a Proportional and Integrative (PI) incremental control. Furthermore, a little vibrator motor acts like a haptic interface and it is put on the user arm; the prosthesis force applied against an object is related with the vibrator motor frequency.
[8]: Wearable technologies are changing the way we deal with health and fitness in our daily life. Nevertheless, while MEMS-enabled inertial sensors have conquered the consumer market, physiological monitoring has still to face barriers due to the complexity and costs of physical interfaces (e.g. electrodes), the degree of intuitiveness of the interaction and the processing required to reach satisfying performance. These limitations are mitigated by the embedded systems' growing integration of interfacing capabilities and efficient computing power. In this paper, we describe the main applications and the related technologies for the acquisition and processing of myoelectric (EMG) signals. Starting from well established active sensors and bench-top setups, we introduce a recent design based on the combination of an integrated Analog Front End (AFE) and embedded processing. This solution provides high quality signal acquisition and on-board digital processing capabilities with a contained power consumption. The system was tested within the prosthesis control application scenario, one of the most stringent EMG applications, achieving a 90% gesture recognition accuracy with real time on-board processing at a power consumption of 30 mW. Such promising results highlight the current trend in shifting EMG applications from dedicated analog solutions towards integrated digital devices, favouring the development of advanced, modular and low-power wearable solutions.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The provided references describe the development and performance of prosthetic control systems using myoelectric signals, as well as challenges in physiological monitoring.

i_2393,Entailment,Key Points: Chitin Content: The fiber in insects is largely attributed to chitin. Studies have shown that the acid detergent fiber (ADF) fraction of insects contains significant amounts of amino acids .,"Insects contain significant amounts of fiber as measured by crude fiber, acid detergent fiber (ADF) or neutral detergent fiber (NDF). It has always been assumed that the fiber in insects represents chitin based on the structural similarity between cellulose and chitin and the fact that the ADF fraction from insects contains nitrogen. In this study, a number of insect species that are raised commercially as food for insectivores were analyzed for moisture, crude protein (nitrogen × 6.25), fat, ash, NDF, ADF, and amino acids. Additionally, the ADF fraction was analyzed for nitrogen and amino acids to determine if proteins might be present in the ADF fraction. The ADF fraction contained a significant amount of amino acids accounting for 9.3-32.7% of the ADF (by weight). The presence of amino acids in the ADF fraction means that using ADF to estimate insect chitin results in an overestimation of insect chitin content. Using ADF adjusted for its amino acid content, the estimated chitin content of these insect species ranged from 2.7-49.8 mg/kg (as is) and 11.6-137.2 mg/kg (dry matter basis). Additionally, these data suggest that for the species measured here the amount of chitin nitrogen is quite small (as a % of total nitrogen) and that crude protein (nitrogen × 6.25) provides a reasonable estimate of the true protein for most species of insects. © 2007 wiley-Liss, inc.",Entailment,"justification: The claim makes two statements. First, it states that the fiber in insects is largely attributed to chitin, which aligns with the reference's statement that it has always been assumed that the fiber in insects represents chitin. Second, the claim mentions that studies have shown that the ADF fraction contains significant amounts of amino acids. The reference supports this by reporting that the ADF fraction indeed contained a significant amount of amino acids (9.3–32.7% by weight). Therefore, the information in the reference directly supports and entails the claim.

Documentation and Traceability: Comprehensive Records: Maintain detailed records of the origin, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and any genetic modifications of the strains. This documentation is crucial for traceability and future research .","Culture collections contain indispensable information about the microorganisms preserved in their repositories, such as taxonomical descriptions, origins, physiological and biochemical characteristics, bibliographic references, etc. However, information currently accessible in databases rarely adheres to common standard protocols. The resultant heterogeneity between culture collections, in terms of both content and format, notably hampers microorganism-based research and development (R&D). The optimized exploitation of these resources thus requires standardized, and simplified, access to the associated information. To this end, and in the interest of supporting R&D in the fields of agriculture, health and biotechnology, a pan-European distributed research infrastructure, MIRRI, including over 40 public culture collections and research institutes from 19 European countries, was established. A prime objective of MIRRI is to unite and provide universal access to the fragmented, and untapped, resources, information and expertise available in European public collections of microorganisms; a key component of which is to develop a dynamic Information System. For the first time, both culture collection curators as well as their users have been consulted and their feedback, concerning the needs and requirements for collection databases and data accessibility, utilised. Users primarily noted that databases were not interoperable, thus rendering a global search of multiple databases impossible. Unreliable or out-of-date and, in particular, non-homogenous, taxonomic information was also considered to be a major obstacle to searching microbial data efficiently. Moreover, complex searches are rarely possible in online databases thus limiting the extent of search queries. Curators also consider that overall harmonization—including Standard Operating Procedures, data structure, and software tools—is necessary to facilitate their work and to make high-quality data easily accessible to their users. Clearly, the needs of culture collection curators coincide with those of users on the crucial point of database interoperability. In this regard, and in order to design an appropriate Information System, important aspects on which the culture collection community should focus include: the interoperability of data sets with the ontologies to be used; setting best practice in data management, and the definition of an appropriate data standard.
[9]: Understanding the metabolic and evolutionary patterns of microorganisms has played a pivotal role in the development of agriculture, industry and health sectors. Therefore, for the ex situ conservation of the microbial diversity, microbial culture collections also known as Biobanks or Microbial Resource Centres remain the most important scientific infrastructure. This review describes the history and evolution of microbial culture collections and the growth of the global community of collections through the activities of the World Federation for Culture Collections (WFCC). In addition, it highlights the roles of culture collections in assisting research and development including the role of an International Depository Authority recognized under Budapest Treaty. Furthermore, the status of microbial culture collections available in India with emphasis on collection of agriculturally important microbes has been investigated. National Agriculturally Important Microbial Culture Collection is a designated national repository established at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research–National Bureau of Agriculturally Important Microorganisms, Maunath, Bhanjan, Uttar Pradesh, India in 2004 and is an affiliate member of WFCC (WDCM-1060) which currently encompasses over 6000 well characterized strains of bacteria, cyanobacteria, fungi etc. The deposited microorganisms are being used as bioinoculants, biopesticides and for management of soil fertility, biotic and abiotic stresses in crops for sustainable production.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes that culture collections maintain detailed records on various attributes such as origins, taxonomical descriptions, and physiological and biochemical characteristics. However, it does not mention documenting genetic modifications, which is a part of the claim.

s_394,Contradiction,"Record Linkage and Identity Matching: Data Integration: In fields such as epidemiologic research, crime analysis, and database marketing, private matching algorithms are used to link records across different data sources without exposing private information. These algorithms allow for the identification of common data while preserving the privacy of the data sets involved .","Record linkage techniques have been widely used in areas such as antiterrorism, crime analysis, epidemiologic research, and database marketing. On the other hand, such techniques are also being increasingly used for identity matching that leads to the disclosure of private information. These techniques can be used to effectively reidentify records even in deidentified data. Consequently, the use of such techniques can lead to individual privacy being severely eroded. Our study addresses this important issue and provides a solution to resolve the conflict between privacy protection and data utility. We propose a data-masking method for protecting private information against record linkage disclosure that preserves the statistical properties of the data for legitimate analysis. Our method recursively partitions a data set into smaller subsets such that data records within each subset are more homogeneous after each partition. The partition is made orthogonal to the maximum variance dimension represented by the first principal component in each partitioned set. The attribute values of a record in a subset are then masked using a double-bounded swapping method. The proposed method, which we call multivariate swapping trees, is nonparametric in nature and does not require any assumptions about statistical distributions of the original data. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both preventing identity disclosure and preserving data quality. © 2011 INFORMS.
[8]: In many business scenarios, record matching is performed across different data sources with the aim of identifying common information shared among these sources. However such need is often in contrast with privacy requirements concerning the data stored by the sources. In this paper, we propose a protocol for record matching that preserves privacy both at the data level and at the schema level. Specifically, if two sources need to identify their common data, by running the protocol they can compute the matching of their datasets without sharing their data in clear and only sharing the result of the matching. The protocol uses a third party, and maps records into a vector space in order to preserve their privacy. Experimental results show the efficiency of the matching protocol in terms of precision and recall as well as the good computational performance.

Unfortunately, these benefits have come at the expense of the surgeon's ability to feel. Several research efforts have already attempted to restore this feature and study the effects of force feedback in robotic systems. The proposed methods and studies have some shortcomings. The main focus of this research is to overcome some of these limitations and to study the effects of force feedback in palpation in a more realistic fashion. Material and methods: A parallel robot assisted minimally invasive surgery system (PRAMiSS) with force feedback capabilities was employed to study the effects of realistic force feedback in palpation of artificial tissue samples. PRAMiSS is capable of actually measuring the tip/tissue interaction forces directly from the surgery site. Four sets of experiments using only vision feedback, only force feedback, simultaneous force and vision feedback and direct manipulation were conducted to evaluate the role of sensory feedback from sideways tip/tissue interaction forces with a scale factor of 100% in characterising tissues of varying stiffness. Twenty human subjects were involved in the experiments for at least 1440 trials. Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were employed to statistically analyse the experimental results. Results: Providing realistic force feedback in robotic assisted surgery systems improves the quality of tissue characterization procedures. Force feedback capability also increases the certainty of characterizing soft tissues compared with direct palpation using the lateral sides of index fingers.

s_1014,Entailment,4. Water Lubrication: Function: Intended to reduce airway injuries during intubation. Evidence: A trial is assessing whether water lubrication of tracheal tubes reduces post-intubation complications compared to no pretreatment. The primary outcome is the incidence of sore throat post-surgery .,"Background: Water is known to have lubricating properties, thus it is used for lubrication of tracheal tubes to reduce airway injuries caused by intubation. However, there is no definite evidence to substantiate the beneficial effects of lubricating tracheal tubes using water for attenuating airway injuries. Moreover, the lubrication pretreatment may cause contamination of the tube, leading to respiratory infections. Therefore, this trial aims to assess whether no pretreatment of tracheal tubes does not increase post-intubation airway complications as compared with water lubrication of tubes. Methods/design: This is a prospective, double-blind, single-center, parallel-arm, noninferiority, randomized controlled trial to be conducted in participants aged 20-80 years who are undergoing elective surgery under general anesthesia with orotracheal intubation. Participants are randomly assigned into one of two groups depending on whether intubation is performed using a tracheal tube lubricated with water (n = 150) or without any pretreatment (n = 150). The primary outcome is the incidence of sore throat at 0, 2, 4, and 24 h after surgery, which is analyzed with a noninferiority test. The secondary outcomes are the incidence and severity of postoperative hoarseness, oropharyngeal injuries, and respiratory infections. Discussion: Because we hypothesized that lubricating tracheal tubes using water has no advantage in reducing airway injuries associated with intubation, we will compare the incidence of sore throat, which is the most common complaint after intubation, in a noninferiority manner. This is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate the possibly beneficial or harmful effects of lubricating tracheal tubes using water before intubation. We expect that this trial will provide useful evidence to formulate a protocol for preparing tracheal tubes before intubation. Trial registration: This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov on 1 July 2015 (NCT02492646)",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that water lubrication is intended to reduce airway injuries during intubation and that a trial is being conducted to assess whether water lubrication reduces post-intubation complications (with sore throat as the primary outcome). The reference explains that water is used for lubrication to reduce airway injuries, describes a trial comparing water-lubricated tracheal tubes with non-pretreated tubes, and specifies that the primary outcome is the incidence of sore throat after surgery. Despite noting concerns over potential contamination and the hypothesis that water lubrication might have no advantage, the reference supports the claim’s description of the trial’s aim and the function of water lubrication.

Patients with cirrhosis are at greater risk for developing bacterial infection, which is associated with failure to control bleeding and higher rates of hospital mortality. Many clinical practice guidelines endorse antimicrobial prophylaxis as standard of care for cirrhotic patients. Objective: The present study was performed to characterize the use of antimicrobial therapy for patients hospitalized with acute variceal hemorrhage. Methods: Medical records of 98 patients hospitalized with suspected variceal hemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed. Results: One-half of the patients received antimicrobials at any time during their hospital admission, and in very few (24%) could prescribed therapy be considered prophylactic. Seventy-seven per cent of patients undergoing endoscopy did not receive an antimicrobial within 24 h of the procedure. Those who received antimicrobial therapy had more severe liver disease (model for end-stage liver disease scores of 19.5±10 versus 12.9±8, P<0.05; Child-Pugh class C 78% versus 65%, not significant) and worse in-hospital outcome (length of stay 17 versus 6.5 days, P<0.05; mortality 15 versus two, P<0.05). Cephalosporins were the most widely prescribed agents (45%), followed by fluoroquinolone (40%). Regimens ranged in length from single-dose administration to two weeks. Conclusions: Patients with liver disease admitted with variceal hemorrhage were often not prescribed antimicrobial therapy to reduce the risk of bacterial infection. These results imply that published practice guidelines are not being consistently observed.

[5]: Background/Aims: In cirrhotic patients, esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB) is still unpredictable and continues despite initial adequate treatment that is associated with great mortality. Bacterial infections are frequently diagnosed in cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB). The aims of this study were to analyze the clinical risk factors and survival of early bleeding after endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). Methodology: A total of 96 cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices who received elective or emergent EVL procedure were analyzed. The variables for risk factors analysis included bacterial infection, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without portal vein thrombosis, etiology of cirrhosis, Child-Pugh status, and basic laboratory data. There were 19 patients with bleeding episode or rebleeding within 14 days after EVL. The remaining 77 patients were without bleeding event after EVL. Results: Patients with Child C cirrhosis (odds ratio, 7.27; 95% CI, 2.20-24.07, P=0.001) and bacterial infection (odds ratio, 130.29; 95% CI, 14.70-1154, P<0.001) were independently associated with the early bleeding after EVL. However, there was no significant difference in long-term survival between patients with and without early bleeding after EVL. Conclusions: Bacterial infection and end-stage liver cirrhosis (Child C) are the independent risk factors for early bleeding after EVL.

According to results from large-scale field and detailed laboratory studies, such a DOC increase could potentially stimulate carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) production, subsequently increasing the partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf> (pCO<inf>2</inf>) in freshwaters. However, the response of pCO<inf>2</inf> to the presently observed long-term increase in DOC in freshwaters is still unknown. Here we tested whether the commonly found spatial DOC-pCO<inf>2</inf> relationship is also valid on a temporal scale. Analyzing time series of water chemical data from 71 lakes, 30 streams, and 4 river mouths distributed across all of Sweden over a 17 year period, we observed significant DOC concentration increases in 39 lakes, 15 streams, and 4 river mouths. Significant pCO<inf>2</inf> increases were, however, only observed in six of these 58 waters, indicating that long-term DOC increases in Swedish waters are disconnected from temporal pCO<inf>2</inf> trends. We suggest that the uncoupling of trends in DOC concentration and pCO<inf>2</inf> are a result of increased surface water runoff. When surface water runoff increases, there is likely less CO<inf>2</inf> relative to DOC imported from soils into waters due to a changed balance between surface and groundwater flow. Additionally, increased surface water runoff causes faster water flushing through the landscape giving less time for in situ CO<inf>2</inf> production in freshwaters. We conclude that pCO<inf>2</inf> is presently not following DOC concentration trends, which has important implications for modeling future CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from boreal waters.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that significant increases in DOC concentrations were accompanied by corresponding increases in pCO₂ in most lakes, implying that DOC increases consistently translate to higher CO₂ emissions. However, the reference explicitly mentions that while significant DOC increases occurred in many water bodies, significant pCO₂ increases were observed in only 6 out of 58 cases. This directly contradicts the claim’s generalization that most lakes showed increased pCO₂ and that DOC increases consistently lead to higher CO₂ emissions.

AI, including embodied AI in robotics and techniques like machine learning, can improve economic, social welfare and the exercise of human rights. Owing to the proliferation of AI in high-risk areas, the pressure is mounting to design and govern AI to be accountable, fair and transparent. How can this be achieved and through which frameworks? This is one of the central questions addressed in this special issue, in which eight authors present in-depth analyses of the ethical, legal-regulatory and technical challenges posed by developing governance regimes for AI systems. It also gives a brief overview of recent developments in AI governance, how much of the agenda for defining AI regulation, ethical frameworks and technical approaches is set, as well as providing some concrete suggestions to further the debate on AI governance.

This model enhances the security of online banking services by ensuring fast consensus and detecting PKI attacks .,"Public key infrastructures (PKIs) are the cornerstone for the security of the communication layer of online services relying on certificate-based authentication, such as e-commerce, e-government, online banking, cloud services, and many others. A PKI is an infrastructure based on a hierarchical model, but the use of PKIs in non-hierarchical contexts has exposed them to many types of attacks. Here, we discuss weaknesses exploited in past attacks and we propose a solution based on an original consensus algorithm developed for use on blockchain technology. In this implementation we retain the full functionality around X.509 certificates, i.e., for the triad (server name, server address, X.509 server certificate), and demonstrate a mechanism for obtaining fast consensus. The main properties of the solution are that a consensus may be reached even when not all members of the involved PKI participate in a transaction, and that no advanced trust agreement among PKIs is needed. The proposed solution is able to detect PKI attacks and can distinguish errors from attacks, allowing precise management of anomalies.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a blockchain-based PKI solution that employs an original consensus algorithm, provides fast consensus, and is capable of detecting PKI attacks. It also mentions online services like online banking as one of its applications.

i_2161,Unverifiable,"Key Points: Pathogen Dynamics: The aggressiveness and prevalence of pathogens can change over time, potentially impacting older wheat plants differently. For instance, continuous cropping and elevated CO₂ levels can lead to increased aggressiveness of certain Fusarium species, which may affect older plants more severely .","[10] One of the means to reduce the use of pesticides, which are harmful for humans and the environment, is the development of alternative methods to control crop diseases. In this context, arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation possesses a great potential for crop production by a more sustainable agriculture. Our work aims to (i) determine the optimal conditions for wheat mycorrhization (ii) study the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation on a foliar disease of wheat, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, Bgt), (iii) evaluate the stimulation of natural defences of wheat (Triticuma estivum). Therefore, this work consisted firstly of defining the parameters, affecting the establishment of wheat mycorrhization, such as: phosphorus concentration (62, 12.5, 6.2 mg/L), culture time (4, 5, 6, 7 weeks), arbuscular mycorrhizal species used as an inoculum (Rhizophagus irregularis (Ri), Glomus masseae (Gm) and the mixture of (Ri+Gm)) and wheat cultivars (Orvantis and Lord, sensitive and moderately resistant to Bgt, respectively). Secondly, the protective effect of mycorrhizal inoculation against Bgt was estimated by comparing infection rates of wheat seedlings subjected and non-subjected to AMF. Finally, to better understand the biochemical mechanisms involved in the protection, two enzymatic activities described as defense markers [lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POX)] were also assessed. Extensive mycorrhization (about 31%) was obtained at P/5 concentration (12.5 mg/L) when wheat plants were 6 weeks old. The highest colonization rate was obtained when wheat was inoculated with Gm compared to SZE and Ri. The higher resistance level of Lord wheat cultivar against Bgt did not affect the mycorrhizal rate compared to the more susceptible cultivar Orvantis. Our work showed a significant protection level in mycorrhizal (M) wheat plants against Bgt, estimated to about 25 and 43% with Ri and SZE respectively compared to non-mycorrhizal (NM) Orvantis plants. The protection levels percent's were about 30 and 64% for Lord plants. The protection was higher for Lord than Orvantis and seems to depend on the resistance degree. These results suggest the induction of a systemic resistance by mycorrhizal inoculation. Our results showed an increase of both activities (LOX and POX) in wheat infected by Bgt for both (M) and (NM) plants by the inoculum SZE (Ri+Gm) at P/5 phosphorus concentration. [11] Zymoseptoria tritici, the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch, a serious foliar disease of wheat, is a necrotrophic pathogen that undergoes a long latent period. Emergence of insensitivity to fungicides, and pesticide reduction policies, mean there is a pressing need to understand septoria and control it through greater varietal resistance. Stb6 and Stb15, the most common qualitative resistance genes in modern wheat cultivars, determine specific resistance to avirulent fungal genotypes following a gene-for-gene relationship. This study investigated compatible and incompatible interactions of wheat with Z. tritici using eight combinations of cultivars and isolates, with the aim of identifying molecular responses that could be used as markers for disease resistance during the early, symptomless phase of colonization. The accumulation of TaMPK3 was estimated using western blotting, and the expression of genes implicated in gene-for-gene interactions of plants with a wide range of other pathogens was measured by qRT-PCR during the presymptomatic stages of infection. Production of TaMPK3 and expression of most of the genes responded to inoculation with Z. tritici but varied considerably between experimental replicates. However, there was no significant difference between compatible and incompatible interactions in any of the responses tested. These results demonstrate that the molecular biology of the gene-for-gene interaction between wheat and Zymoseptoria is unlike that in many other plant diseases, indicate that environmental conditions may strongly influence early responses of wheat to infection by Z. tritici, and emphasize the importance of including both compatible and incompatible interactions when investigating the biology of this complex pathosystem.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that pathogen aggressiveness and prevalence can change over time—with continuous cropping and elevated CO₂ increasing Fusarium aggressiveness against older plants. However, the reference material [10] focuses exclusively on mycorrhizal inoculation effects on wheat diseases (specifically regarding powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis) and does not mention Fusarium species, continuous cropping, elevated CO₂ levels, or differential effects on older wheat plants. Reference [11] discusses research on Zymoseptoria tritici and wheat’s molecular responses but does not address the Fusarium pathogen or the specific factors mentioned in the claim. Thus, the information provided in the reference does not offer evidence either supporting or contradicting the details about Fusarium aggressiveness affected by continuous cropping and elevated CO₂.

i_341,Unverifiable,"Applications include environmental monitoring, where sensor networks are used to gather and analyze data for various purposes, including scientific research and urban management .","Networked embedded sensor and actuator technology has developed over the last decade to now enable the vision of Ambient Intelligence. This will fundamentally advance our ability to monitor and control the physical world with applications for consumers, healthcare, the commercial enterprise, security, and for science and engineering in the natural environment. Significantprogress has been made in the development of algorithms and complete systems for scalable, energy-aware networking, sensing, signal processing, and embedded computing. Now, new information technology, microelectronics, and sensor systems are being integrated and deployed in some of the first applications in critical environmental monitoring. This progress, however, reveals a new set of challenges. Specifically, distributed sensor networks have not yet acquired the essential capability to monitor and report their own spatiotemporally-dependent sensing uncertainty. Thus, while sensor networks may acquire information on events in the environment these systems are not yet able to determine the probability that events may be undetected or determine how the combination of calibration error and unknown signal propagation characteristics may degrade the ability to fuse data across a distribution of sensors. For example, in virtually all important application areas, static sensor nodes are confronted with unknown and evolving obstacles to vision or acoustic signal propagation that severely limit the ability to characterize features of interest and introduce uncertainty. Most importantly, self-awareness of sensing uncertainty will be required, for in many applications it is only the sensor network that may be present in an environment and must be depended upon to report its true performance. It is important to note that since it is physical phenomena and evolving environmental structures that induce uncertainty, then physical adaptation of a sensor network (for example, through robotic mobility) may provide the only practical method for detection and reduction of uncertainty. This chapter describes a broad new research thrust, Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS), that provides networked nodes exploiting infrastructure- supported mobility for autonomous operations and physical reconfiguration. As shown in Fig. 1, NIMS infrastructure and mobility allow nodes (Figure Presented) to explore complex, full three-dimensional environments. This also enables active reduction of uncertainty through physical reconfiguration of sensing nodes and infrastructures. NIMS adds a unique capability for acquisition and transport of physical samples (for example of water or atmosphere) thereby providing methods for detection and analysis of trace components that are not detectable by conventional in situ sensors. System operating lifetime is extended by NIMS infrastructure that provides energy harvesting (for example of solar energy) and energy distribution. Finally, NIMS mobility and aerial deployment provides networking resources that may be located and oriented to optimize wi eless links for mobile and fixed node systems. The remainder of this chapter begins in Sect. 2 with a description of the challenge problem of sensing uncertainty that inevitably appears in complex environments. The NIMS sensor diversity capability is discussed next with its benefits for reducing sensing uncertainty, enabling adaptive sensor fusion, and extending rate-distortion, bandwidth and energy limits in distributed sensor networks. NIMS applications are also described for natural environmental science and civil (built environment) monitoring. Section 3 introduces sensing diversity and its information theoretic foundations. Sensing diversity reduces sensing uncertainty by exploiting the ability to introduce new sensor systems and to reconfigure sensor networks through robotic mobility. Section 3 then continues with description of the fusion-based detection and localization enabled by NIMS. The development of NIMS introduces essential new tiers in the distributed sensing architecture. These new tiers perm t sensing, sampling, and logistics for transport of nodes, physical samples, energy, and data. The NIMS system hierarchy combines static and mobile sensor nodes, and physically reconfigurable infrastructure that provide sustainable mobility in large, complex three-dimensional spaces. This System Ecology and its attributes are described in Sect. 4 along with the methods of Coordinate Mobility that exploit the System Ecology for self-aware sensing and sampling. Finally, this chapter concludes with a description of a NIMS Ambient Intelligence application with a system deployment in natural environment monitoring. © 2005 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes applications of sensor networks in monitoring the environment, highlighting deployments in natural environmental science and civil (built environment) monitoring.

NDVI tends to be higher during the peak growing season when water availability is sufficient, and lower during the dry season when water stress is prevalent .","The objective of this study is to assess the influence of drought on vegetation vigour. The correlation analysis based on different vegetation type was conducted between monthly NDVI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the growing season within the Laohahe catchment. It was found that NDVI had good correlation with the PDSI, especially for shrubs and grasses. The correlation between NDVI and PDSI varies significantly from one month to another. The influence of drought on vegetation vigour is stronger in the first half of the growing season before the vegetation reaches its peak greenness. In order to take the seasonal effect into consideration, a regression model with seasonal dummy variables was used to simulate the relationship between the NDVI and PDSI. The results showed that the NDVI-PDSI relationship was significant (α = 0.05), and that NDVI was an effective indicator to monitor and detect droughts if seasonal timing was taken into account.

[5]: In this study, seasonal field measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using a field spectroradiometer, and leaf area index (LAI), using a LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, were compared with above-ground phytomass data to investigate relationships between vegetation properties and spectral indices for four distinct tundra vegetation types at Ivotuk, Alaska (68.49°N, 155.74°W). NDVI, LAI and above-ground phytomass data were collected biweekly from four 100 m × 100 m grids, each representative of a different vegetation type, during the 1999 growing season. Shrub phytomass, especially the live foliar deciduous shrub phytomass, was the major factor controlling NDVI across all vegetation types. LAI showed the strongest relationship with the overstorey component (total above-ground excluding moss and lichen) of phytomass and also showed a significant relationship with NDVI. The results from this study illustrated that time of the growing season in which sampling is conducted, non-linearity of relationships, and plant composition are important factors to consider when using relationships between NDVI, LAI and phytomass to parameterize or validate ecological models. The relationships established in this study also suggest that NDVI is useful for estimating levels of total live above-ground phytomass and LAI in tundra vegetation. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd.",Entailment,"justification: The reference makes it clear that NDVI values vary on a monthly basis due to seasonal effects and that the relationship between NDVI and drought (as measured by the PDSI) is significant when seasonal timing is taken into account. However, the reference does not explicitly state the pattern described in the claim—that NDVI is higher during the peak growing season (when water availability is sufficient) and lower during the dry season (when water stress is prevalent). The reference focuses on the growing season and the impact of drought within it rather than directly contrasting peak growing season with a distinct dry season.

Most interactions are observed in only one year, suggesting that species abundances and interaction frequencies are entirely unpredictable and do not follow any discernible patterns annually .","Ecological interactions are highly dynamic in time and space. Previous studies of plant–animal mutualistic networks have shown that the occurrence of interactions varies substantially across years. We analyzed interannual variation of a quantitative mutualistic network, in which links are weighted by interaction frequency. The network was sampled over six consecutive years, representing one of the longest time series for a community-wide mutualistic network. We estimated the interannual similarity in interactions and assessed the determinants of their persistence. The occurrence of interactions varied greatly among years, with most interactions seen in only one year (64%) and few (20%) in more than two years. This variation was associated with the frequency and position of interactions relative to the network core, so that the network consisted of a persistent core of frequent interactions and many peripheral, infrequent interactions. Null model analyses suggest that species abundances play a substantial role in generating these patterns. Our study represents an important step in the study of ecological networks, furthering our mechanistic understanding of the ecological processes driving the temporal persistence of interactions.",Entailment,"justification: The reference confirms that plant–pollinator interactions vary significantly from year to year and that most interactions occur in only one year, which aligns with the first part of the claim. However, the claim goes further by stating that species abundances and interaction frequencies are entirely unpredictable and do not follow any discernible patterns annually. In contrast, the reference provides evidence of a consistent pattern with a persistent core of frequent interactions and indicates that species abundances play an important role in shaping the observed variation. This contradicts the claim’s assertion about the complete unpredictability of these interactions.

s_1055,Entailment,"1.  -    BMSC-EXOs have shown potential in reducing neuronal cell death, improving myelin arrangement, and enhancing blood-spinal cord barrier integrity. They achieve this by inhibiting inflammatory responses and promoting cell survival pathways .","Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is a promising treatment strategy for spinal cord injury, but immunological rejection and possible tumor formation limit its application. The therapeutic effects of MSCs mainly depend on their release of soluble paracrine factors. Exosomes are essential for the secretion of these paracrine effectors. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (BMSC-EXOs) can be substituted for BMSCs in cell transplantation. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, a rat model of T10 spinal cord injury was established using the impact method. Then, 30 minutes and 1 day after spinal cord injury, the rats were administered 200 μL exosomes via the tail vein (200 μg/mL; approximately 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>BMSCs). Treatment with BMSC-EXOs greatly reduced neuronal cell death, improved myelin arrangement and reduced myelin loss, increased pericyte/endothelial cell coverage on the vascular wall, decreased blood-spinal cord barrier leakage, reduced caspase 1 expression, inhibited interleukin-1β release, and accelerated locomotor functional recovery in rats with spinal cord injury. In the cell culture experiment, pericytes were treated with interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α. Then, Lipofectamine 3000 was used to deliver lipopolysaccharide into the cells, and the cells were co-incubated with adenosine triphosphate to simulate injury in vitro. Pre-treatment with BMSC-EXOs for 8 hours greatly reduced pericyte pyroptosis and increased pericyte survival rate. These findings suggest that BMSC-EXOs may protect pericytes by inhibiting pyroptosis and by improving blood-spinal cord barrier integrity, thereby promoting the survival of neurons and the extension of nerve fibers, and ultimately improving motor function in rats with spinal cord injury. All protocols were conducted with the approval of the Animal Ethics Committee of Zhengzhou University on March 16, 2019.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly verifies the claim’s key points. It states that BMSC-EXOs reduce neuronal cell death, improve myelin arrangement, and enhance blood-spinal cord barrier integrity by reducing inflammatory markers (like caspase-1 and interleukin-1β levels) and promoting cell survival (as seen with increased pericyte survival). This directly corresponds to the claim's statement that BMSC-EXOs reduce neuronal death, improve myelin, enhance barrier integrity, inhibit inflammatory responses, and promote cell survival pathways.

s_91,Contradiction,"Furthermore, AI-driven frameworks for urban land use mapping, utilizing crowdsourcing features and ensemble learning, demonstrate the potential for accurate and detailed land use classification, which can be applied to rural cadastral land as well .","Detailed information on urban land uses has been an essential requirement for urban land management and policymaking. Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users' demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference discusses an AI-driven framework for urban land use mapping using crowdsourcing features and ensemble learning and demonstrates its accuracy for urban settings.

s_2112,Entailment,Natural Filtration Methods: Biological Filtration (Biofiltration): Description: Involves managing biological activity on granular media to enhance the removal of organic and inorganic constituents. Process: Biofilters reduce natural organic matter (NOM) and other pollutants through biological activity. This method is widely used and has been successful across various water qualities and conditions .,"[2] Bank filtration is a relative low cost system for raw water treatment or pre-treatment for drinking water abstraction, used in European countries since about 140 years with very good experiences, but up to now knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological processes of water purification is still insufficient, especially under consideration of the application of this technology in other countries. Focus of interest are the mechanical, physicochemical, chemical and biological processes during infiltration pathway such as the retention of particulate organic material (POM), especially of algae cells with toxic cell compounds (cyanobacteria), the turnover of natural organic matter (NOM), bacteria and viruses, and the retention of toxicology relevant micro pollutants like cyanotoxins and drugs. The water infiltration during bank filtration is not only controlled hydraulically but determined by severe clogging processes mainly triggered by accumulation of biological components in the upper sediment layer. Clogging of the interstice is regularly observed in infiltration ponds, and up to now several mechanisms can be distinguished like physical (input of fine sediments, building of gas bubbles), chemical (precipitation mainly of carbonates) and biological processes (excretion of extracellular substances by algae and bacteria). As a consequence water permeability of the interstice will become strictly reduced. The interstice are place of an adapted biocoenosis of bacteria, fungi, algae and meiofauna, which is characterized by the occurrence of extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS). The meiofauna counteracts the clogging process by detritivorous activity. For many contaminants like DOM, POM, pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) and cyanobacteria as well as cyanotoxins a good removal is given. The active sediment layer is the first meter of infiltration pathway with a decrease in DOC concentration of up to 50% and high removal rates of 10<sup>2</sup> - 10<sup>4</sup> for pathogens like bacteria and protozoa. [7] Land application of dairy soiled water (DSW) is expensive relative to its nutrient replacement value. The use of aerobic filters is an effective alternative method of treatment and potentially allows the final effluent to be reused on the farm. Knowledge gaps exist concerning the optimal design and operation of filters for the treatment of DSW. To address this, 18 laboratory-scale filters, with depths of either 0.6 m or 1 m, were intermittently loaded with DSW over periods of up to 220 days to evaluate the impacts of depth (0.6 m versus 1 m), organic loading rates (OLRs) (50 versus 155 g COD m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>), and media type (woodchip versus sand) on organic, nutrient and suspended solids (SS) removals. The study found that media depth was important in contaminant removal in woodchip filters. Reductions of 78% chemical oxygen demand (COD), 95% SS, 85% total nitrogen (TN), 82% ammonium-nitrogen (NH<inf>4</inf>[Formula presented]), 50% total phosphorus (TP), and 54% dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were measured in 1 m deep woodchip filters, which was greater than the reductions in 0.6 m deep woodchip filters. Woodchip filters also performed optimally when loaded at a high OLR (155 g COD m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>), although the removal mechanism was primarily physical (i.e. straining) as opposed to biological. When operated at the same OLR and when of the same depth, the sand filters had better COD removals (96%) than woodchip (74%), but there was no significant difference between them in the removal of SS and NH<inf>4</inf>[Formula presented]. However, the likelihood of clogging makes sand filters less desirable than woodchip filters. Using the optimal designs of both configurations, the filter area required per cow for a woodchip filter is more than four times less than for a sand filter. Therefore, this study found that woodchip filters are more economically and environmentally effective in the treatment of DSW than sand filters, and optimal performance may be achieved using woodchip filters with a depth of at least 1 m, operated at an OLR of 155 g COD m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that the biofiltration process manages biological activity on granular media to remove NOM and pollutants effectively and that it is widely used. The reference, while discussing bank filtration and aerobic/woodchip filters, highlights that natural filtration processes in soils and sediments (bank filtration) include biological processes that reduce NOM, pathogens, and other pollutants. Additionally, it mentions the effectiveness and long history of such processes in treating water. Although the reference also mentions other processes alongside biological ones, it does provide support for the role of biological activity in reducing pollutants in natural filtration settings. Therefore, the reference supports the core elements of the claim.

Total age-standardised incidence was 138.5 per million for Europe overall, and varied between regions from 131.1 per million in the British Isles to 160.1 per million in Northern Europe. Incidence varied significantly between regions for nearly all diagnostic groups. The greatest range of regional incidence rates was for central nervous system (CNS) tumours, from 27.0 per million in the West to 43.8 per million in the North. Differences in registration practice for non-malignant tumours account for some of this variation. There was a marked excess of carcinoma in Eastern Europe, which was wholly attributable to the high incidence of thyroid carcinoma in Belarus, though there was also evidence of inter-regional variation attributable to differences in registration practice.

[2]: Introduction: Childhood brain tumours (CBTs) are the second most common type of cancer in individuals aged 0–24 years globally and cause significant morbidity and mortality. CBT aetiology remains poorly understood, however previous studies found higher CBT incidence in high-income countries (HIC) compared to low-middle income countries (LMIC), suggesting a positive relationship between incidence and wealth. Materials & methods: Aggregated data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) were used to explore CBT epidemiology. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) compared CBT rates between twenty-five geographically and economically diverse countries. The relationship between incidence and economic development was explored using linear regression models and Spearman's rank correlation tests. Trends in CBT incidence between 1978 and 2012 were investigated using average annual percentage changes (AAPC). Results: CBT incidence was highest in North America and lowest in Africa. CBT incidence rates increased significantly with increasing GDP per capita (p = 0.006). Gini index was significantly negatively associated with CBT incidence. Incidence decreased with increasing income inequality within countries, indicated by higher Gini indices (p = 0.040). Increasing and decreasing CBT incidence trends were observed within individual countries, although only Italy (p = 0.02) and New Zealand (p < 0.005) experienced statistically significant changes over time. Conclusions: The excess disease found in HIC may be explained by environmental risk factor exposure increasing CBT risk in wealthy populations. However, systematic limitations of substandard cancer detection and reporting in LMIC may mean incidence disparities result from misinformation bias rather than genuine differences in risk factor exposure. Further research is required to comprehensively describe CBT epidemiology and explain study findings.",Entailment,"justification: The reference provides data demonstrating considerable regional differences in the incidence of CNS (childhood brain) tumors in Europe, such as the reported range from 27.0 per million in the West to 43.8 per million in the North. It also explains that some of this variation can be attributed to differences in registration practices (a proxy for diagnostic practices) and possibly differences in underlying risk factors related to healthcare and detection methodologies. This supports the claim that there is significant geographical heterogeneity influenced by diagnostic practices and healthcare infrastructure.

The overall resistance rates among Aeromonas isolates from the treatment plant were highest for ampicillin (87%) and erythromycin (79%) followed by cephalothin (58%), nalidixic acid (52%), streptomycin (51%), tetracycline (31%), chloramphenicol (13%) and gentamicin (8%). A significantly lower prevalence of antibiotic resistance was found in Aeromonas from environmental control water, patient stool samples, duckweed and fish compared to sewage water isolates. The prevalence of resistance in the sewage water was not significantly reduced compared to the lagoon water and fish pond. Throughout the treatment system, the frequencies of resistant strains were found to diminish during the sewage water purification process, i.e. in the lagoon where sewage water is used to grow the duckweed. However, the frequency of resistant strains again increased in the fish pond where sewage grown duckweed is used for aquaculture. Among the selected isolates, two multiresistant clonal groups of Aeromonas caviae HG4 were identified that exhibited indistinguishable PhP and amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprints and shared a common plasmid of approximately 5 kb. Representatives of both groups were recovered from almost every part of the sewage treatment plant but not in the control ponds nor in human samples, which suggests that specific multiresistant Aeromonas clones are able to persist and spread throughout the entire purification process. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.",Entailment,"justification: The claim asserts that although proper treatment of wastewater is generally considered important for controlling antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), even well-managed systems can still harbor resistant strains. The provided references show evidence of persistent antibiotic-resistant bacteria in water systems despite undergoing treatment processes. In the second part of the reference, for example, although the frequency of resistant strains diminishes during part of the sewage water purification process, they resurface later in the fish pond, indicating that resistant clones persist through the treatment system. This supports the claim’s suggestion that treatment alone may not be sufficient to eliminate these threats.

s_2057,Contradiction,"- **Water Balance and Ecohydrology**: Afforestation does not significantly alter the water balance in grassland areas. For instance, a study on the Loess Plateau found that afforestation with black locust trees did not lead to the understory being the main water consumer, which is similar to natural grasslands where annual seepage remained consistent . This suggests that afforestation can maintain or even enhance water availability in grasslands, potentially benefiting the native vegetation and water-dependent species.","The world's largest afforestation programs implemented by China made a great contribution to the global ""greening up."" These programs have received worldwide attention due to its contribution toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. However, emerging studies have suggested that these campaigns, when not properly implemented, resulted in unintended ecological and water security concerns at the regional scale. While mounting evidence shows that afforestation causes substantial reduction in water yield at the watershed scale, process-based studies on how forest plantations alter the partitioning of rainwater and affect water balance components in natural vegetation are still lacking at the plot scale. This lack of science-based data prevents a comprehensive understanding of forest-related ecosystem services such as soil conservation and water supply under climate change. The present study represents the first ""Paired Plot"" study of the water balance of afforestation on the Loess Plateau. We investigate the effects of forest structure and environmental factors on the full water cycle in a typical multilayer plantation forest composed of black locust, one of the most popular tree species for plantations worldwide. We measure the ecohydrological components of a black locust versus natural grassland on adjacent sites. The startling finding of this study is that, contrary to the general belief, the understory—instead of the overstory—was the main water consumer in this plantation. Moreover, there is a strict physiological regulation of forest transpiration. In contrast to grassland, annual seepage under the forest was minor in years with an average rainfall. We conclude that global long-term greening efforts in drylands require careful ecohydrologic evaluation so that green and blue water trade-offs are properly addressed. This is especially important for reforestation-based watershed land management, that aims at carbon sequestration in mitigating climate change while maintaining regional water security, to be effective on a large scale.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that afforestation, specifically with black locust trees on the Loess Plateau, does not significantly change the water balance; it states that the understory does not become the main water consumer, and that annual seepage remains consistent with that in natural grasslands. In contrast, the reference explicitly reports that, in the studied plantation, the understory was indeed the main water consumer and that annual seepage under the forest was minor compared to grassland sites. These findings directly contradict the claim's statements regarding water consumption and seepage.

The advantage of which is avoiding or at least minimizing animal testing and chemical waste due to experimental testing as well as reducing the time to market. However, in the literature, there are just a few examples of how in silico tools could be implemented in the BbD process.

While both the claim and the reference promote designing chemicals with safer environmental profiles using BbD principles and in silico tools, the claim goes further by stating that such chemicals and materials are inherently non-toxic and fully biodegradable and that they “automatically” become safe for the environment. The reference does not make this blanket guarantee nor does it imply that all products designed under BbD will automatically be safe. It focuses on a design strategy without asserting an absolute outcome. Therefore, the reference does not fully verify the claim’s sweeping implication.

Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately US$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also very high, with estimates from US$ 1 to US$ 20 billion up to 2030. Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties, and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges for large-scale implementation of these instruments.",Entity error,"justification: The claim describes ecological fiscal transfers as financial transfers from higher levels of government to local governments based on ecological indicators (including biodiversity conservation), aimed at supporting local conservation initiatives. The reference, while not detailing the specific administrative mechanism (i.e. transfers from higher to lower governments or explicitly stating the use of ecological indicators), does include ecological fiscal transfer as one of the key financial mechanisms analyzed for biodiversity conservation.

Results indicated that the final weight, specific growth rate, survival rate and feed efficiency rate of shrimp in the treatment groups were significantly improved versus the control (P < 0.05). The challenge test of Vibrio parahaemolyticus showed that the cumulative mortalities of shrimp in the CB and UI groups were significantly lower than that in the control (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, total nitric oxide synthase, lysozyme, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities, total antioxidant capacity, and phenonoloxidase content in the serum and the relative expression levels of SOD, LZM, proPO, LGBP, HSP70, Imd, Toll, Relish, TOR, 4E-BP, eIF4E1α, eIF4E2 genes in the hepatopancreas of CB and HI shrimp groups were all significantly enhanced, and those were significantly improved in the UI group as well, except for phenonoloxidase content, relative expression levels of SOD, Imd and eIF4E2 genes (P < 0.05). However, immune responses were induced partially in the FS shrimp group. These results suggested that dietary both live and dead cells of C. butyricum CBG01 could improve the growth performance and immune responses of shrimp.

i_2136,Contradiction,"### Key Points on Wheat Resistance to Pathogens 1. **Climate and Environmental Factors**: Climate change, including increased CO₂ levels and altered precipitation patterns, is likely to make all wheat varieties equally susceptible to pathogens like Fusarium species. Elevated CO₂ levels have been conclusively shown to increase Fusarium biomass and mycotoxin production in wheat tissues, regardless of the specific wheat line .","Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused mainly by a few members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is a major threat to agricultural grain production, food safety, and animal health. The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<inf>2</inf>]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions. Additional research in this area should be a priority so that breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies can be developed.
[2]: This study examines the CO<inf>2</inf>-mediated influence of plant resistance on crown rot dynamics under continuous cropping of partially resistant wheat line 249 and the susceptible cultivar Tamaroi. Disease incidence, severity, deoxynivalenol and Fusarium biomass were assessed after each cycle in microcosms established at ambient and 700 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> CO<inf>2</inf> using soil and stubble of these wheat lines from a field experiment with free to air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment. Monoconidial isolates from wheat stubble were collected initially, and after five cropping cycles, to compare the frequency and aggressiveness of Fusarium species in the two populations. Aggressiveness was measured using a high-throughput seedling bioassay. At elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, the higher initial incidence in Tamaroi increased with cropping cycles, but incidence in 249 remained unchanged. Incidence at ambient CO<inf>2</inf> did not change for either line. Elevated CO<inf>2</inf> induced partial resistance in Tamaroi, but not in 249. Increased Fusarium biomass in wheat tissue at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> matched raised deoxynivalenol of the stem base in both lines. After five cycles of continuous wheat cropping, aggressiveness increased in pathogenic F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum by 110%, but decreased in weakly pathogenic F. equiseti and F. oxysporum by 50%. CO<inf>2</inf> and host resistance interactively influenced species frequency, and the highly aggressive F. pseudograminearum became dominant on Tamaroi irrespective of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration, while its frequency declined on 249. This study shows that induced resistance at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> will not reduce crown rot severity, or impede the selection and enrichment of Fusarium populations with increased aggressiveness.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that under climate change conditions, specifically with increased CO₂ levels, all wheat varieties become equally susceptible to Fusarium infection and that elevated CO₂ conclusively increases Fusarium biomass and mycotoxin production regardless of the wheat line. In contrast, the reference discusses the variability in responses among different wheat genotypes. Notably, study [2] shows that in one wheat line (Tamaroi), disease incidence increased under elevated CO₂ while it remained unchanged for another partially resistant line (249). This indicates differential responses rather than a universal effect across all varieties. Therefore, the reference contradicts the claim.

i_2238,Unverifiable,"Adaptability and Responses to Environmental Changes: Generalists: Adaptability: Generalists can adjust their behavior and resource use to cope with environmental changes, such as urbanization or climate change .","The small variability of habitat generalist abundances in relation to landscape changes has been related to their behavioural flexibility. We hypothesise that successful generalists, such as the starling, compensate for feeding resource difficulties (poor quality of food, accessibility) in habitats such as urban ecosystems and that its behavioural flexibility allows for similar breeding performance in rural and urban areas. Along an urbanisation gradient we compared simultaneously (1) success factors such as the abundance of breeding starlings, their breeding performance and the fitness of nestlings, and (2) possible flexibility quantified through the rate of parental food-provisioning, and the composition and the amount of food delivered to nestlings. Abundance of breeding starlings are similar throughout the urbanisation gradient, but urbanisation profoundly and negatively affects reproductive parameters of starlings. Differences in the amount of food delivered to nestlings by parents (less food in town centre), and the small masses of nestlings reared in the urban sectors support the idea that urban nestlings received insufficient food loads. Despite modifications to their diurnal food-provisioning rhythm and the incorporation of some human food refuse into their diet, starling parents have a significantly reduced production of young in the urban centre sector. We rebut the idea that the ""generalist"" starling is able to breed successfully anywhere: other more ""specialist"" species succeed in producing their young by innovating more in terms of diet resources. We suggest defining successful birds with respect to colonisation or invasion process through behavioural innovation rather than an ambiguous habitat generalist definition. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

[6]: Background: The ratio of habitat generalists to specialists in birds has been suggested as a good indicator of ecosystem changes due to e.g. climate change and other anthropogenic perturbations. Most studies focusing on this functional component of biodiversity originate, however, from temperate regions. The Eurasian Arctic tundra is currently experiencing an unprecedented combination of climate change, change in grazing pressure by domestic reindeer and growing human activity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored bird communities in a tundra landscape harbouring shrub and open habitats in order to analyse bird habitat relationships and quantify habitat specialization. We used ordination methods to analyse habitat associations and estimated the proportions of specialists in each of the main habitats. Correspondence Analysis identified three main bird communities, inhabiting upland, lowland and dense willow shrubs. We documented a stable structure of communities despite large multiannual variations of bird density (from 90 to 175 pairs/km<sup>2</sup>). Willow shrub thickets were a hotspot for bird density, but not for species richness. The thickets hosted many specialized species whose main distribution area was south of the tundra. Conclusion/Significance: If current arctic changes result in a shrubification of the landscape as many studies suggested, we would expect an increase in the overall bird abundance together with an increase of local specialists, since they are associated with willow thickets. The majority of these species have a southern origin and their increase in abundance would represent a strengthening of the boreal component in the southern tundra, perhaps at the expense of species typical of the subarctic zone, which appear to be generalists within this zone. © 2012 Sokolov et al.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that generalists can adjust their behavior and resource use to cope with environmental changes like urbanization or climate change. The first part of the reference indicates that the small variability in generalist abundance is linked to their behavioral flexibility, and it discusses how generalists such as starlings adjust their feeding behavior in urban settings. Although the reference also presents some limitations (e.g., reduced reproductive success in urban centers), it still supports the idea that generalists modify their behavior to cope with altered resource conditions. Additionally, the second part of the reference mentions ecosystem changes in relation to habitat specialization, which indirectly acknowledges that responses to environmental shifts are important. Therefore, the details provided support the claim that generalists adjust their behavior in response to environmental changes.

Hypertension is an important risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events. Coffee may help reduce blood pressure (BP) in humans, which might be attributable to its polyphenolic compound, chlorogenic acid. The high incidence of hypertension among Canadians underscores the need for new and effective strategies to reduce BP. Dietary interventions may constitute such a strategy, but consumers need to be informed about which foods are most effective for regulating BP. To guide healthy eating, Health Canada permits the use of health claims on the labels of foods that confer health benefits. Currently, there is only one health claim for BP regulation. Additional health claims for foods that assist in BP regulation are therefore warranted. This review provides background information on chlorogenic acid and examines the evidence regarding the use of chlorogenic acid for BP regulation in the context of Health Canada's health claims framework.
[4]: Background: Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide. In the last years, coffee consumption has been associated with a number of beneficial effects against metabolic impairment. The aim of this narrative review was to report the most updated and comprehensive evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies as well as mechanisms of action of coffee on metabolic impairment. Methods: A search in electronic databases (PUBMED and EMBASE) was performed to retrieve systematic and pooled analyses on coffee and diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the most accredited hypotheses and mechanisms of action of coffee have been described. Results: Coffee consumption has been associated with reduced risk of diabetes in observational studies. However, the effect seems not to be mediated by caffeine. Contrasting results have been found in pooled analyses of observational studies on hypertension, despite short- and long-term follow-ups that have been demonstrated to influence the outcome. Poor or little effect on plasma lipids has been reported in studies on acute administration of coffee, yet depending on the type of coffee preparation. The main beneficial effects of coffee consumption seem to rely on the content of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds (i.e., polyphenols). Among the most important, chlorogenic acids have demonstrated direct anti-hypertensive action through beneficial effect on endothelial function, and significant improvement in glucose and insulin metabolism. Also, diterpenes and melanoidins are major candidates as antioxidant compounds showing the capacity to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators. However, caffeine and diterpenes may also exert negative effects, such as acute rise in blood pressure and serum lipids. Conclusion: In light of the most recent evidence, coffee consumption seems to be favorably related with health and to protect by metabolic impairment.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that coffee may increase blood pressure due to its caffeine content, leading to increased cardiovascular strain.

Poor maternal education and inadequate household conditions do not exacerbate stunting .","Poor linear growth in children <5 years old, or stunting, is a serious public health problem particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a conceptual framework on the Context, Causes and Consequences of Childhood Stunting (the 'WHO framework') that identifies specific and general factors associated with stunting. The framework is based upon a global review of data, and we have applied it to a country-level analysis where health and nutrition policies are made and public health and nutrition data are collected. We reviewed the literature related to sub-optimal linear growth, stunting and birth outcomes in Ethiopia as a case study. We found consistent associations between poor linear growth and indicators of birth size, recent illness (e.g. diarrhoea and fever), maternal height and education. Other factors listed as causes in the framework such as inflammation, exposure to mycotoxins and inadequate feeding during and after illness have not been examined in Ethiopia, and the existing literature suggests that these are clear data gaps. Some factors associated with poor linear growth in Ethiopia are missing in the framework, such as household characteristics (e.g. exposure to indoor smoke).

[5]: Objective To estimate the determinants of stunting using rich data from a birth cohort study from urban South Africa and to examine the various mechanisms, both proximate and distal, through which maternal education affects stunting. Design Multivariate regression analysis using birth cohort data, where the outcome variable was stunting at age 2 years, and multiple mediator analysis to identify pathways from maternal education to stunting. Setting South Africa's largest metropolitan area, Soweto-Johannesburg. Subjects Participants of Birth to Twenty Plus, a longitudinal cohort study of children born in 1990 (n 691). Results In multivariate analysis, the birth weight Z-score (-0·084; P<0·001; 95 % CI-0·11,-0·06), the mother's openness towards modern health care, captured by a vaccination score (-0·05; P=0·04; 95 % CI-0·10,-0·00), and a better-quality care environment (-0·015; P=0·04; 95 % CI-0·03,-0·00) were found to be negatively associated with stunting. Having experienced symptoms of illness related to ears and eyes increased the risk of stunting (0·038; P=0·01; 95 % CI 0·01, 0·07). Results of the mediation analysis showed that maternal education had an indirect effect on stunting largely through socio-economic status and the antenatal environment (measured by the birth weight Z-score). Conclusions Overall, many of the factors that were protective against stunting in the final analysis, whether they operated through maternal education or not, were related to the mother's contribution to the child's life. This reinforces the idea that to minimise stunting, enhanced antenatal and postnatal services to better support and empower mothers may be important.
[6]: Background: This study examines how significant is the changes in child stunting in Sub-Saharan African countries (SSA). Then, it investigates factors that contributed to the reduction in child stunting in those countries. For each country, we distinguish the contribution of compositional effects and structural effect. Methods: This paper uses data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 12 sub-Saharan African countries conducted between 2000 and 2020. The z-test to compare two independent proportions was used to assess changes in child stunting and explanatory variables over the period. Recentred influence function (RIF) decomposition method was used to decompose changes in stunting over the year in each country, and to determine the contribution of each variable to the changes. Results: The prevalence of child stunting declines significantly in 11 countries over the year. The decline varies from 6.8% in Cameroun to 19% in Mali. The average year of education of the child's mother and father, and the proportion of households with access to an improved drinking water source have contributed to the reduction in child stunting. This result was found in all the countries. Improvements in living standards, child vaccination, antenatal care attendance, delivery to health care centres, maternal education, improved drinking water sources, and improved sanitation make the largest contribution to the composition component, hence reducing child stunting. Conclusions: This study sheds light on what has contributed to the achieved improvement in child nutritional status and suggests how to possibly accelerate the reduction in undernutrition in countries that lag.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that maternal education, household cleanliness, and socioeconomic status have little to no impact on stunting, and that poor maternal education and inadequate household conditions do not worsen stunting. However, the reference clearly presents evidence that maternal education is consistently associated with stunting outcomes. For example, the WHO framework identifies maternal education as a factor associated with poor linear growth, and the referenced studies show that maternal education indirectly affects stunting (through socioeconomic status and other mediators) and that improvements in maternal education contribute to a reduction in stunting. These points contradict the claim by indicating that socioeconomic factors, including maternal education and household conditions, significantly impact stunting.

Especially in cities, the use of zero-emission vehicles like electric vehicles is favourable, as emissions of conventional cars cause severe air pollution. Besides CO2, the most important emissions are nitric oxides, particular matter and noise. Given the trend of urbanisation, the problem of air pollution in large cities will rather grow than diminish. Although electric vehicles are an infrastructure-depen­dent technology, one important advantage of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) com­pared to hydrogen-powered vehicles is the possibility to use the existing electricity infrastructure in households for charging. While additional public charging infra­structure is also needed for interim charging or overnight charging for the so-called 'on-street parkers' without own garage, the majority of vehicles could be operated as EVs without additional public charging infrastructure. However, public charging infrastructure is an important component for the large-scale diffusion of electric vehicles and political action seems necessary since no business models are pres­ently available.

While users welcome new and innovative mobility options, this current paradigm shift presents a challenge for authorities that plan, organize, and operate such services. In particular, integrating new mobility services into existing infrastructure systems can generate problems of acceptance, cooperability, and compatibility. This problem is especially relevant for electric vehicles. Limited range and battery capacity of battery electric vehicles make them dependent on charging infrastructure, which in turn hinders their acceptance. In light of the German government's goal of one million electric vehicles by 2020, establishing a demand-oriented charging infrastructure is of crucial importance. However, numerous questions remain unanswered regarding the quantity, type, and location of electric vehicle charging stations in Germany.

Five treatments were examined: control (wheat monoculture: 36 seedlings per pot), and intercropping of wheat with different planting densities of S. plumbizincicola (3, 6, 9 and 15 seedlings per pot, respectively). Results showed a decrease in soil pH, and in soil and wheat contents of Cd and Zn with increasing planting density of S. plumbizincicola, while the removal rate of Cd and Zn increased. Meanwhile, excessive planting (15 seedlings per pot) inhibited wheat growth by 27.34% compared with the control, and overall, the optimal planting density was 9 seedlings per pot, resulting in effective remediation with only a moderate effect on wheat growth.

Likewise, various research initiatives have advocated recycling of construction and demolition wastes and novel technologies to avert their generation. Owing to disadvantages of steel rebar, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) was utilized as potential internal reinforcement in recycled concrete beam owing to its lightweight, non-corrosiveness, high-stiffness-to-weight ratio and flexibility. Our study revealed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and efficiency which is controlled by the fibre architecture. The improved mechanical properties was attributed to the Bauschinger strain-reversal effect, made possible by the effective CFRP tensile strength mobilization, its high bonded surface area and interfacial energy as well as the composite action of the multi-layered CFRP reinforcements. The best configuration (N4) revealed by the simplified linear weighted sum optimization method achieved strengthening (load) efficiency of 402.7%, ductility efficiency of 299.7%, fracture toughness efficiency of 567.1% and fracture energy efficiency of 5713.9% compared to the unreinforced control. In addition, CFRP laminate was 3.67–4.9 times more cost-effective than steel rebar in terms of fracture toughness. Therefore, CFRP-reinforced recycled concrete is recommended for cost-effective and sustainable prefabricated concrete structures.
[11]: Advanced fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) systems have been widely used for the structural strengthening and rehabilitation of existing buildings and bridges for decades. Such as the engineering community has accepted these systems as viable, long-term strengthening solutions for structural bridge and building elements, so too have they accepted them for the rehabilitation and strengthening of pipelines. This relatively novel FRP technology is extremely conducive to application in pipeline rehabilitation and strengthening; its unidirectional strength properties and malleable form make precision design and installation of the system efficient and cost-effective in many applications. As the design of FRP pipeline strengthening systems becomes more refined, so too must the inspection methods used to assure these systems' proper installation and post-installation performance. Various experiences have been compiled from nuclear, industrial, and municipal installations on steel, reinforced concrete, and pre-stressed concrete cylinder piping. Resulting conclusions and best-practices on processes ranging from monitoring of in-field environmental conditions, to critical points of structural observation during installation, and proper methods of post-cure imperfection detection and remediation will be defined and presented within this paper. The aim of this work will be to inform end-users and installers alike of necessary inspection and observation steps required during installations to ensure the safe and proper performance of FRP pipeline strengthening systems.",Missing information,"justification: The claim states that using CFRP or other advanced composites mitigates corrosion and extends structure lifespan but comes with higher initial costs. While the reference supports the advantages of CFRP regarding corrosion resistance and enhanced mechanical performance, it explicitly points out that CFRP is more cost-effective than steel rebar (being 3.67–4.9 times more cost-effective in terms of fracture toughness) and recommends its use for cost-effective and sustainable structures. This cost-effectiveness directly contradicts the claim’s assertion of higher initial costs.

In this study, we established and optimized a two-phase anaerobic packed bed biofilm reactor system (AnPBR) with porous PVA gel beads used as bio-carriers and ran the reactor system in a steady state to observe the VFAs produced along with the microbial diversity of the predominant species at different stages of the reactor system. We observed that acetate and butyrate were the predominant intermediate VFAs while concentrations of other VFAs such that propionic acid were low. Acetobacterium and Clostridium were found to be the most abundant bacterial species in acidogenic reactor while methanogenic reactor was highly enriched with Methanobacterium and Methanosarcina.

Internet-scale applications like Facebook and YouTube are served by large CDNs like Akamai and Google CDN, which push content as close to end-users as possible to improve the overall performance of the applications, minimize the effects of peering point congestion and enhance the user experience. The load is balanced among multiple servers or caches according to non-disclosed CDN internal policies. As such, adopting space and time variant policies, users' requests are served from different physical locations at different time. Cache selection and load balancing policies can have a relevant impact on the traffic routed by the underlying transport network, as well as on the end-user experience. In this paper, we analyze the provisioning of two major Internet applications, namely Facebook and YouTube, in two datasets collected at major European Internet Service Providers (ISPs). First, we show how the cache selection performed by Akamai might result in higher transport costs for the ISP. Second, we present evidence on large-scale outages occurring in the Facebook traffic distribution. Finally, we characterize the variation of YouTube cache selection strategies and their impact on the users' quality of experience. We argue that it is important for the ISP to rapidly and automatically detect such events. Therefore, we present an Anomaly Detection (AD) system for detecting unexpected cache-selection events and changes in the traffic delivered by CDNs. The proposed algorithm improves over traditional AD approaches by analyzing the complete probability distribution of the monitored features, providing higher visibility and better detection capabilities.

Protecting diverse habitats like coral reefs and rocky substrates is crucial for maintaining healthy sea urchin populations and overall marine biodiversity .,"In order to preserve diversity it is essential to understand how assemblages change across space. Despite this fact, we still know very little about how marine diversity is spatially distributed, especially among lesser-studied invertebrate taxa. In the present study beta-diversity patterns of sea urchins, sponges, mushroom corals and larger foraminifera were assessed in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia). Using ordinations we showed that the inshore zone (<5 km offshore), midshore zone (5 < × < 30 km offshore) and distance offshore zone (<30 km offshore) all contained distinct assemblages of sponges and corals, while only foraminifera assemblages from the inshore (<5 km offshore) zone were distinct. There was a significant spatial pattern of community similarity for all taxa surveyed, but this pattern proved to be wholly related to environmental variables for sponges and foraminifera, and primarily for mushroom corals and sea urchins. The lack of a pure spatial component suggests that these taxa may not be dispersal limited within the spatial scales of this study (c. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>). The analyses of the corals and foraminifera were additionally tested at two spatial scales of sampling. Both taxa were primarily associated with local-scale environmental variables at the local scale and larger-scale variables at the larger scale. Mean inter-plot similarity was also higher and variation lower at the larger scale. The results suggest that substantial variation in similarity can be predicted using simple locally assessed environmental variables combined with remotely sensed parameters. © 2006 The Authors.

[8]: This paper examines published information and gray literature about taxonomy and ecology of echinoderm species of the Colombian Pacific Coast. Unpublished collection data of specimens kept in the Marine Sciences Museum of the University of Valle are also considered. Sixty-six species are found in coastal ecosystems and shallow bottoms of ten geographical, coastal and insular localities of the Pacific coast of Colombia. Main habitats having echinoderms are: rocky cliffs and shores, coral reefs, sand beaches, mud substrates, mangroves, and shallow bottoms of mud, sand, gravel and rocks. Regular Echinoidea and Asteroidea are the most diverse and abundant groups, mainly in subtidal rocky shallow bottoms and coral reefs. Ophiuroidea are abundant below rocky boulders. Irregular Echinoidea are abundant on sand beaches. The relatively high number of species shows that this geographical area presents a high diversity of echinoderms compared with other tropical shallow and littoral zones of the world. Rocky substrates and coral reefs are the ecosystems with the highest numbers of echinoderm species and individuals. A conservation status assessment is difficult because the lack of periodical sampling and few data about deep zones. In general, the species reported in the last 25 years, have not experimented important changes in their populations, although in some specific places, populations may decrease because human activities in coastal areas increase sedimentation rates change some rocky substrates to mud or sand.",Entailment,"justification: The reference emphasizes that understanding spatial variations (i.e., how assemblages change across space) is key to preserving marine diversity, and it shows that sea urchins (grouped with other invertebrates) have significant spatial patterns linked to environmental factors. Additionally, the second part of the reference identifies coral reefs and rocky substrates as ecosystems with high numbers of echinoderm species, implying that these habitats are vital. Although the reference does not explicitly state “conservation” or prescribe management actions, the information provided supports the idea that understanding sea urchin spatial distribution and protecting critical habitats (like coral reefs and rocky substrates) is important for maintaining their populations and overall diversity.

Partial remedies for this are regularization techniques e.g. dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, transfer learning, early stopping and data augmentation. In this paper we have focused on data augmentation.

In a proposed approach, the newly created images are described with pseudo-labels, and then used as a training dataset. Real, labeled images are divided into the validation and test set. We validated proposed method on a challenging skin lesion classification case study. Four representative neural architectures are examined.

In response, multilevel mitigation strategies are being adopted but with a lack of quantitative assessment of how such strategies reduce plastic emissions. We assessed the impact of three broad management strategies, plastic waste reduction, waste management, and environmental recovery, at different levels of effort to estimate plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries. We estimate that 19 to 23 million metric tons, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems. Considering the ambitious commitments currently set by governments, annual emissions may reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030. To reduce emissions to a level well below this prediction, extraordinary efforts to transform the global plastics economy are needed.

In particular, small-scale plastic debris such as microplastics and nanoplastics has become leading contributors to the pollution of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Studies are investigating the impacts of micro-and nanoplastics on aquatic organisms and ecosystems worldwide. This review covers 83 studies that investigated the distribution of microplastics and the ecotoxicity of micro- and nanoplastics in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The studies indicated that micro-sized plastics and plastic debris were distributed at various concentrations in aquatic ecosystems around the world. They had various effects on the growth, development, behavior, reproduction, and mortality of aquatic animals. We discuss these studies in detail and suggest directions for future research.

The paper also demonstrates a methodology for interpreting TSDD measurements to estimate remaining pavement structural capacity. Curvature indexes measured from TSDD were found to be reasonable estimators of pavement structural condition and were used in the demonstration. Horizontal tensile strain, a primary initiator of fatigue damage and cracking, can be estimated from periodic TSDD measurements and used as a leading indicator of pavement deterioration and structural performance.

In the near future mmWave bands will also be used above 6 GHz (for example 24 GHz, 28 GHz and above). Theoretical models and live measurements have consistently shown that the actual maximum power is always less than the 25% of the maximum peak power of a Massive-MIMO antenna. ICNIRP has published in 1998 ""Guidelines for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (100 kHz to 300 GHz)"". The current revision (2020) is based on the same criteria, but it exhibits more accuracy in dosimetry calculations, considering details and based on better biological rationale. mmWave bands (> 6 GHz) is a controversial issue for the population. Reports did not show adverse health effects in daily life under the safety limits. WHO is currently preparing a review about health risks assessment of RF exposure (including mm-Waves), which will be completed by 2022. There is no evidence of adverse health effects at exposure levels below the basic restrictions as described in the ICNIRP (1998) and ICNIRP (2020) guidelines and no evidence of an interaction mechanism that would predict that adverse health effects could occur due to radiofrequency EMF exposure below restriction levels. The new Guidelines provide protection against all adverse health effects, regardless of whether they are due to acute or chronic exposures, regardless of age or health status. Radio and Microwave Frequencies, where mobile technology and Wi-Fi operate, are used in Medicine for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. These bands are used for various application as Microwave Diathermy (same band as 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi technologies), Microwave induced thermoacoustic echography (same band as 4G technology), Medical Imaging / localization of tumors (same bands as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies) and Medical Monitoring / Measurement of vital function as respiration and heart rate (same band as the forthcoming mmWave 5G). By utilizing new technologies that are involved in 5G communication (IoT and mmWave frequencies) healthcare systems can improve the quality of care, provide more personalized and preventive care and reduce the cost of care.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that while there are ongoing discussions about potential health effects of wireless technologies (specifically regarding EMFs), current guidelines show no evidence of adverse health effects below the safety limits. In the reference, even though the first part mentions that 5G produces different harmful effects, the detailed section [3] explicitly notes that multiple reviews and measurements have shown no adverse health effects when exposures remain below the guideline thresholds. This directly supports the claim’s second part regarding the current guidelines. Therefore, the reference supports the claim.

s_1529,Unverifiable,"The activity of PHT4 transporters is likely controlled post-translationally, allowing plants to adjust phosphate uptake in response to varying environmental conditions .","Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) absorbs inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through an active transport process mediated by the nine members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) family. These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response. Such reactions have been uncoupled from PHT1 activity, suggesting that systemic Pi sensing is most probably acting downstream of PHT1.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim discusses the post-translational control of PHT4 transporters and their role in adjusting phosphate uptake, but the reference is entirely about the PHT1 family of phosphate transporters. Although the reference mentions post-translational regulation for some PHT1 transporters, it does not address PHT4 transporters at all. Therefore, there isn’t enough information in the reference to support the claim concerning PHT4 transporters.

i_2074,Entailment,"Significance of Varying Hydraulic Conductance: Impact on Water Use Efficiency: Variations in hydraulic conductance affect the plant's ability to transport water efficiently, impacting transpiration rates and water use efficiency (WUE) .","Plant hydraulic conductance (k<inf>s</inf>) is a critical control on whole-plant water use and carbon uptake and, during drought, influences whether plants survive or die. To assess long-term physiological and hydraulic responses of mature trees to water availability, we manipulated ecosystem-scale water availability from 2007 to 2013 in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) woodland. We examined the relationship between k<inf>s</inf> and subsequent mortality using more than 5 years of physiological observations, and the subsequent impact of reduced hydraulic function and mortality on total woody canopy transpiration (E<inf>C</inf>) and conductance (G<inf>C</inf>). For both species, we observed significant reductions in plant transpiration (E) and k<inf>s</inf> under experimentally imposed drought. Conversely, supplemental water additions increased E and k<inf>s</inf> in both species. Interestingly, both species exhibited similar declines in k<inf>s</inf> under the imposed drought conditions, despite their differing stomatal responses and mortality patterns during drought. Reduced whole-plant k<inf>s</inf> also reduced carbon assimilation in both species, as leaf-level stomatal conductance (g<inf>s</inf>) and net photosynthesis (A<inf>n</inf>) declined strongly with decreasing k<inf>s</inf>. Finally, we observed that chronically low whole-plant k<inf>s</inf> was associated with greater canopy dieback and mortality for both piñon and juniper and that subsequent reductions in woody canopy biomass due to mortality had a significant impact on both daily and annual canopy E<inf>C</inf> and G<inf>C</inf>. Our data indicate that significant reductions in k<inf>s</inf> precede drought-related tree mortality events in this system, and the consequence is a significant reduction in canopy gas exchange and carbon fixation. Our results suggest that reductions in productivity and woody plant cover in piñon-juniper woodlands can be expected due to reduced plant hydraulic conductance and increased mortality of both piñon pine and juniper under anticipated future conditions of more frequent and persistent regional drought in the southwestern United States. We examined the relationship between plant hydraulic conductance (k<inf>s</inf>) and subsequent tree mortality using more than 5 years of physiological observations in a piñon pine and juniper woodland subjected to varying degrees of experimental water manipulation. For both species, we observed significant reductions in transpiration, hydraulic conductance, and net photosynthetic carbon fixation under experimentally imposed drought, and we observed that chronically low whole plant k<inf>s</inf> was associated with greater canopy dieback and mortality for both piñon and juniper. Thus, our data indicate that significant reductions in whole plant k<inf>s</inf> precede drought related tree mortality events in piñon-juniper woodland ecosystems subjected to prolonged periods of chronic water stress.
[12]: Plants control water-use efficiency (WUE) by regulating water loss and CO<inf>2</inf> diffusion through stomata. Variation in stomatal control has been reported among lineages of vascular plants, thus giving rise to the possibility that different lineages may show distinct WUE dynamics in response to water stress. Here, we compared the response of gas exchange to decreasing leaf water potential among four ferns and nine seed plant species exposed to a gradually intensifying water deficit. The data collected were combined with those from 339 phylogenetically diverse species obtained from previous studies. In well-watered angiosperms, the maximum stomatal conductance was high and greater than that required for maximum WUE, but drought stress caused a rapid reduction in stomatal conductance and an increase in WUE in response to elevated concentrations of abscisic acid. However, in ferns, stomata did not open beyond the optimum point corresponding to maximum WUE and actually exhibited a steady WUE in response to dehydration. Thus, seed plants showed improved photosynthetic WUE under water stress. The ability of seed plants to increase WUE could provide them with an advantage over ferns under drought conditions, thereby presumably increasing their fitness under selection pressure by drought.",Entailment,"justification: The reference clearly shows that changes in hydraulic conductance (kₛ) affect whole‐plant water use and transpiration. It demonstrates that reduced kₛ under drought conditions is associated with lowered transpiration rates and diminished photosynthetic carbon fixation. However, while the claim states that variations in hydraulic conductance also impact water use efficiency (WUE), the provided references do not explicitly link hydraulic conductance to changes in WUE. One section focuses on the effects of water manipulation on kₛ and transpiration, and another discusses WUE in relation to stomatal control rather than hydraulic conductance. Since the connection between variations in hydraulic conductance and water use efficiency is not directly demonstrated, it is unclear if the full claim is supported.

When things are connected to the internet it becomes an open path for adversaries to unlawfully gain data over the internet leading to unaccountable security issues pertaining to data integrity and privacy. The need to secure the data gathered from sensors is important as this eventually gives trust to the larger data, the big data.

s_969,Unverifiable,"Summary of Findings: Key Points: Drug Metabolism and Hypothermia: Hypothermia affects drug metabolism, which can increase the risk of adverse effects, including hypothermia, when psychotropic drugs are administered .","OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to decrease neurologic damage in patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In addition to being treated with hypothermia, critically ill patients are treated with an extensive pharmacotherapeutic regimen. The effects of hypothermia on drug disposition increase the probability for unanticipated toxicity, which could limit its putative benefit. This review examines the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on the disposition, metabolism, and response of drugs commonly used in the intensive care unit, with a focus on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A MEDLINE/PubMed search from 1965 to June 2006 was conducted using the search terms hypothermia, drug metabolism, P450, critical care, cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and pharmacokinetics. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies were included in this review. The effects of therapeutic hypothermia on drug disposition include both the effects during cooling and the effects after rewarming on drug metabolism and response. The studies cited in this review demonstrate that the addition of mild to moderate hypothermia decreases the systemic clearance of cytochrome P450 metabolized drugs between ∼7% and 22% per degree Celsius below 37°C during cooling. The addition of hypothermia decreases the potency and efficacy of certain drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that the therapeutic index of drugs is narrowed during hypothermia. The magnitude of these alterations indicates that intensivists must be aware of these alterations in order to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of this modality. In addition to increased clinical attention, future research efforts are essential to delineate precise dosing guidelines and mechanisms of the effect of hypothermia on drug disposition and response. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.
[4]: Introduction: Therapeutic hypothermia is being employed clinically due to its neuro-protective benefits. Both critical illness and therapeutic hypothermia significantly affect drug disposition, potentially contributing to drug-therapy and drug-disease interactions. Currently, there is limited information on the known alterations in drug concentration and response during mild hypothermia treatment, and there is a limited understanding of the specific mechanisms that underlie alterations in drug concentrations and the potential clinical importance of these changes. Areas covered: A systemic review of the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on drug metabolism, disposition and response is provided. Specifically, the clinical and preclinical evidence of the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on blood flow, specific hepatic metabolism pathways, transporter function, renal excretion, pharmacodynamics and the effects during rewarming are reviewed. Expert opinion: Available evidence demonstrates that mild hypothermia decreases the clearance of a variety of drugs with apparently little change in drug-protein binding. Recent evidence suggests that the magnitude of the change is elimination route specific. Further research is needed to determine the impact of these alterations on both drug concentration and response in order to optimize the therapeutic hypothermia in this vulnerable patient population. © Informa UK, Ltd.
[5]: Background: Therapeutic hypothermia may alter both the pharmacokinetic (PK) and dynamics (PD) of the commonly used drugs in critical care. To achieve maximum benefit, medication dosage and schedules should be optimized. Objective: To review the existing scientific evidence showing the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly used in the care of patients after Trauma Brain Injury (TBI); particularly including sedatives, anticonvulsants and antibiotics. Data Sources: Computerized searches of OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register to August 2013 and hand searching of references of retrieved articles and proceedings of meetings; associated reference lists; and articles identified by experts in the field. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were as follows: a) population- humans or animals undergoing therapeutic hypothermia b) design-prospective, randomized controlled trial, c) intervention-hypothermia; measurement of PD and PK of different drugs. Data Extraction: A data extraction form was used and authors (CB & SP) reviewed all trials. Data Synthesis: We reviewed 30 trials that documented changes in PD and PK of sedatives (propofol and midazolam), opioids (fentanyl, remifentanil, alfentil and morphine), anticonvulsants (phenytoin) and antibiotics (aminoglycosides) conducted in human or animal models undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Conclusion: Data show that therapeutic hypothermia significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of commonly used agents. Particular care should be taken to reduce sedatives once target temperature is reached. Further clinical studies are required to clarify the effect of hypothermia on the PD and PK of therapeutic agents to optimize the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of TBI patients. © Bagna et al.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference passages describe how therapeutic hypothermia influences drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics, noting that reduced clearance may lead to toxicity or altered drug response. However, the claim specifically links these alterations to psychotropic drugs and suggests that their administration may lead to adverse effects – including hypothermia – which is not mentioned or supported in any of the provided references. There is no discussion in the references about psychotropic drugs or adverse effects such as hypothermia resulting from their use. Thus, while the references do discuss hypothermia’s impact on drug metabolism, they do not specifically back the claim as worded.

Early-stage disease may be asymptomatic. Advances in imaging techniques have improved selection of the appropriate treatment approach. Treatment options vary for each stage. An excisional cone is sufficient for treatment of micro-invasive disease (Ia1) provided the margins are clear. The management of stage Ia2 disease is more controversial. Surgery and radiation have similar survival rates for stage Ib-IIa disease, while the combination of both increases morbidity. Later stage tumours (IIb-IV) should be treated with chemoradiation as this is related to improved survival but also higher short- and medium-term toxicity in comparison to radiotherapy alone. Fertility-sparing surgical techniques such as radical trachelectomy may be appropriate in selected cases.

i_1286,Entailment,Interventions and Recommendations: Preventing bullying victimization can mitigate anxiety and depression among adolescents affected by poverty .,"South African children and adolescents living in HIV/AIDS-affected families are at elevated risk of both symptoms of anxiety and depressive symptoms. Poverty and HIV/AIDS-related stigma are additional risk factors for these negative mental health outcomes. Community level factors, such as poverty and stigma, are difficult to change in the short term and identifying additional potentially malleable mechanisms linking familial HIV/AIDS with mental health is important from an intervention perspective. HIV/AIDS-affected children are also at increased risk of bullying victimization. This longitudinal study aimed to determine whether prospective relationships between familial HIV/AIDS and both anxiety symptoms and depressive symptoms operate indirectly via bullying victimization. Adolescents (M = 13.45 years, 56.67 % female, n = 3,515) from high HIV-prevalent (>30 %) communities in South Africa were interviewed and followed-up one year later (n = 3,401, 96.70 % retention). Census enumeration areas were randomly selected from urban and rural sites in two provinces, and door-to-door sampling included all households with a resident child/adolescent. Familial HIV/AIDS at baseline assessment was not directly associated with mental health outcomes 1 year later. However, significant indirect effects operating via bullying victimization were obtained for both anxiety and depression scores. Importantly, these effects were independent of poverty, HIV/AIDS-related stigma, and baseline mental health, which highlight bullying victimization as a potential target for future intervention efforts. The implementation and rigorous evaluation of bullying prevention programs in South African communities may improve mental health outcomes for HIV/AIDS-affected children and adolescents and this should be a focus of future research and intervention.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a study among adolescents from HIV/AIDS‐affected families and shows that bullying victimization plays a mediating role between familial HIV/AIDS and subsequent anxiety and depression. Although poverty is mentioned as an independent risk factor, the study does not directly focus on adolescents affected primarily by poverty, nor does it explicitly test interventions that prevent bullying victimization. Therefore, while the reference suggests that targeting bullying might improve mental health outcomes in this specific population, it does not provide explicit evidence that preventing bullying victimization mitigates anxiety and depression among adolescents affected by poverty in a general sense.

This is particularly evident in healthcare systems, where such integration supports clinical decision-making and antimicrobial resistance surveillance .","Introduction: Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have complex patients in terms of their diagnoses and required treatments. Antimicrobial treatment is a common therapy for patients in NICUs. To solve problems pertaining to empirical therapy, antimicrobial stewardship programs have recently been introduced. Despite the success of these programs in terms of data collection, there is still inefficiency in terms of analyzing and reporting the data. Thus, to successfully implement these stewardship programs, the design of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance systems is recommended as a first step. As a result, this study aimed to design an AMR surveillance system for use in the NICUs in northwestern Iranian hospitals to cover these information gaps. Methods: The recommended system is compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The business intelligence (BI) requirements were extracted in an interview with a product owner (PO) using a valid and reliable checklist. Following this, an AMR surveillance system was designed and evaluated in relation to user experiences via a user experience questionnaire (UEQ). Finally, an association analysis was performed on the database, and the results were reported by identifying the important multidrug resistances in the database. Results: A customized software development methodology was proposed. The three major modules of the AMR surveillance are the data registry, dashboard, and decision support modules. The data registry module was implemented based on a three-tier architecture, and the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and dashboard modules were designed based on the BI requirements of the Scrum product owner (PO). The mean values of UEQ measures were in a good range. This measures showed the suitable usability of the AMR surveillance system. Conclusion: Applying efficient software development methodologies allows for the systems' compatibility with users' opinions and requirements. In addition, the construction of interdisciplinary communication models for research and software engineering allows for research and development concepts to be used in operational environments.
[4]: Abstract Background: Effective implementation of a Primary Care Medical Home model of care (PCMH) requires integration of patients' contextual information (physical, mental, social and financial status) into an easily retrievable information source for the healthcare team and clinical decision-making. This project explored clinicians' perceptions about important attributes of contextual information for clinical decision-making, how contextual information is expressed in CPRS clinical documentation as well as how clinicians in a highly computerized environment manage information flow related to these areas. Methods: A qualitative design using Cognitive Task Analyses and a modified Critical Incident Technique were used. The study was conducted in a large VA with a fully implemented EHR located in the western United States. Seventeen providers working in a PCMH model of care in Primary Care, Home Based Care and Geriatrics reported on a recent difficult transition requiring contextual information for decision-making. The transcribed interviews were qualitatively analyzed for thematic development related to contextual information using an iterative process and multiple reviewers with ATLAS@ti software. Results: Six overarching themes emerged as attributes of contextual information: Informativeness, goal language, temporality, source attribution, retrieval effort, and information quality. Conclusions: These results indicate that specific attributes are needed to in order for contextual information to fully support clinical decision-making in a Medical Home care delivery environment. Improved EHR designs are needed for ease of contextual information access, displaying linkages across time and settings, and explicit linkages to both clinician and patient goals. Implications relevant to providers' information needs, team functioning and EHR design are discussed.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that integrating Business Intelligence (BI) and Decision Support Systems (DSS) into information systems has improved decision-making processes, especially in healthcare systems by supporting clinical decision-making and antimicrobial resistance surveillance. The reference describes a designed AMR surveillance system for NICUs where BI requirements were gathered and a decision support module (part of the overall system which includes a dashboard tailored to BI needs) was implemented. This directly supports the claim’s notion that BI and DSS integration helps with comprehensive data analysis, reporting, and ultimately supports clinical decision-making in antimicrobial resistance surveillance.

i_1588,Entailment,"Environmental Impacts on Marine Life: Benthic Environment: The installation of wind turbines will inevitably alter the seabed's morphodynamics, significantly affecting sediment transport and hydrodynamic conditions. This will almost certainly lead to drastic changes in the benthic habitat, severely impacting biodiversity, biomass, and nutrient regeneration .","Global-scale environmental degradation and its association with nonrenewable fossil fuels have led to an increasing interest in generation of electricity by renewable energy resources (Gill 2005). Since the planning of large offshore wind energy facilities in the German Bight and the Baltic Sea was initiated, concerns about the ecological compatibility of these structures have been expressed. Apart from direct impacts of disturbance during construction, operational sounds and rotating parts, which might primarily affect birds, bats, marine mammals and fish, the potential long term effects on the benthic environment have been discussed. These concerns are mainly focused on the questions, whether and how the natural benthic habitat in the vicinity of the constructions is modified by changes in bottom currents and turbulence, and whether the effects of the installations as artificial settling substrates are properly assessed. The ecologically relevant effects of offshore wind parks include e.g., increased habitat heterogeneity, and changes in hydrodynamic conditions and in sediment transport patterns. The potential ecological response of the macrozoobenthos could involve long-term changes in diversity, abundance, biomass, community structure and such functional properties as nutrient regeneration or bio-turbation. These problems have been in the focus of a project in the western Baltic which that was part of a national combination of projects called BeoFINO.1 This effort has addressed the overall ecological risks of offshore wind-power facilities in the North and Baltic Seas. Such questions are most often viewed in the primary context of the effects on the biodiversity of the benthic community. In the Baltic Sea however, the specific hydrographical conditions emphasizes a problem which also involves the absolute biomass accumulation rates of epifauna on substrates that protrude into the surface mixed layer. Particularly in the inflow areas of denser, more saline North Sea water adjacent to the Belt Sea and the Danish Sound, severe vertical stratification between the surface mixed layer and the bottom water overlying the sediments is the rule rather than the exception. The stratification is much more stable than in the North Sea, as tidal mixing is not an effective source of vertical exchange in the Baltic. Surface productivity is high in these areas, at least partly due to anthropogenic eutrophication, and as the density gradient does not constrain organic particles from sinking into deeper water, but prevents dissolved oxygen from mixing downwards, these benthic areas are extremely susceptible to oxygen deficiency. The increase of benthic biomass due to enhanced nutrition over the past 50 years (Karlson et al. 2002) has already aggravated the problem of unbalanced oxygen supply and consumption. In Baltic estuaries with a similarly strong stratification regime, bottom anoxia events have been documented (e.g. Powilleit and Kube, 1997), with destructive wide-ranging effects on benthic ecosystems and such associated economies as fishing, tourism and recreation. Additional point sources of organic matter to the sedimentary systems in such areas may initiate local cores of anoxia, which then start to spread over larger areas in an exponential fashion, when the suffocated benthic biomass is itself subject to microbial decomposition and oxygen demand. This scenario is particularly alarming, as most projected wind parks in the western Baltic are planned to be positioned exactly in the areas of most intense vertical stratification, either in the Pomeranian Bight at the estuarine stratification of the Oder plume, or at Kriegers Flak at the outlet and subduction area of dense saline water from the Danish Sound. As these environments are extremely sensitive to the input of additional organic matter, the export of benthic biomass from the higher parts of structures to the surrounding sediments became a relevant aspect in the study. Recent studies on ecological impacts of offshore wind farms on the benthic ecosystems are rare and mainly published as reports (e.g. Birklund and Petersen 2004, Leonard and Pedersen 2004 et al. cited in Gill 2005). Within the present study, both qualitative and quantitative aspects of benthic growth dynamics in the western Baltic at an artificial pile model were investigated. A delay in the construction of a full size research platform in the key area of Kriegers Flak led to the installation of a reduced size model pile in the region of Darss Sill, which is an area restricted to research. Over a period of two years, larval settling dynamics, biomass development and a succession of benthic organisms was observed at and around this pile, as well as on additional artificial settling substrates throughout the water column. The presence of an adjacent autonomous monitoring station that registers and logs such basic environmental data as salinity, temperature and currents supported the interpretation of the results. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

i_533,Entailment,"Key Setbacks in Self-Repairing Electronic Technologies: Skin-Inspired Electronics: Properties: Current electronic materials fail to replicate the properties of human skin, lacking stretchability, self-healing, and biodegradability. These materials are predominantly made from rigid metals and non-biodegradable substances .","ConspectusFuture electronics will take on more important roles in people's lives. They need to allow more intimate contact with human beings to enable advanced health monitoring, disease detection, medical therapies, and human-machine interfacing. However, current electronics are rigid, nondegradable and cannot self-repair, while the human body is soft, dynamic, stretchable, biodegradable, and self-healing. Therefore, it is critical to develop a new class of electronic materials that incorporate skinlike properties, including stretchability for conformable integration, minimal discomfort and suppressed invasive reactions; self-healing for long-term durability under harsh mechanical conditions; and biodegradability for reducing environmental impact and obviating the need for secondary device removal for medical implants. These demands have fueled the development of a new generation of electronic materials, primarily composed of polymers and polymer composites with both high electrical performance and skinlike properties, and consequently led to a new paradigm of electronics, termed ""skin-inspired electronics"".This Account covers recent important advances in skin-inspired electronics, from basic material developments to device components and proof-of-concept demonstrations for integrated bioelectronics applications. To date, stretchability has been the most prominent focus in this field. In contrast to strain-engineering approaches that extrinsically impart stretchability into inorganic electronics, intrinsically stretchable materials provide a direct route to achieve higher mechanical robustness, higher device density, and scalable fabrication. The key is the introduction of strain-dissipation mechanisms into the material design, which has been realized through molecular engineering (e.g., soft molecular segments, dynamic bonds) and physical engineering (e.g., nanoconfinement effect, geometric design). The material design concepts have led to the successful demonstrations of stretchable conductors, semiconductors, and dielectrics without sacrificing their electrical performance. Employing such materials, innovative device design coupled with fabrication method development has enabled stretchable sensors and displays as input/output components and large-scale transistor arrays for circuits and active matrixes. Strategies to incorporate self-healing into electronic materials are the second focus of this Account. To date, dynamic intermolecular interactions have been the most effective approach for imparting self-healing properties onto polymeric electronic materials, which have been utilized to fabricate self-healing sensors and actuators. Moreover, biodegradability has emerged as an important feature in skin-inspired electronics. The incorporation of degradable moieties along the polymer backbone allows for degradable conducting polymers and the use of bioderived materials has led to the demonstration of biodegradable functional devices, such as sensors and transistors. Finally, we highlight examples of skin-inspired electronics for three major applications: prosthetic e-skins, wearable electronics, and implantable electronics.",Entailment,"justification: The reference clearly states that current electronics are rigid, nondegradable, and lack self-repair capabilities—mirroring the claim's assertion that current materials lack stretchability, self-healing, and biodegradability because they are made from rigid and non-biodegradable substances. Both the claim and the reference emphasize the shortcomings of current electronic materials in replicating human skin's properties.

s_1557,Entailment,"Veronica persica: Delphinidin glycosides are identified in the flowers, but not specifically in the nectar .","Glycosylation is one of the key modification steps for plants to produce a broad spectrum of flavonoids with various structures and colors. A survey of flavonoids in the blue flowers of Veronica persica Poiret (Lamiales, Scrophulariaceae), which is native of Eurasia and now widespread worldwide, led to the identification of highly glycosylated flavonoids, namely delphinidin 3-O-(2-O-(6-O-p-coumaroyl-glucosyl)-6-O-p-coumaroyl-glucoside)-5-O-glucoside (1) and apigenin 7-O-(2-O-glucuronosyl)-glucuronide (2), as two of its main flavonoids. Interestingly, the latter flavone glucuronide (2) caused a bathochromic shift on the anthocyanin (1) toward a blue hue in a dose-dependent manner, showing an intermolecular co-pigment effect. In order to understand the molecular basis for the biosynthesis of this glucuronide, we isolated a cDNA encoding a UDP-dependent glycosyltransferase (UGT88D8), based on the structural similarity to flavonoid 7-O-glucuronosyltransferases (F7GAT) from Lamiales plants. Enzyme assays showed that the recombinant UGT88D8 protein catalyzes the 7-O-glucuronosylation of apigenin and its related flavonoids with preference to UDP-glucuronic acid as a sugar donor. Furthermore, we identified and functionally characterized a cDNA encoding another UGT, UGT94F1, as the anthocyanin 3-O-glucoside-2″-O-glucosyltransferase (A3Glc2″GlcT), according to the structural similarity to sugar-sugar glycosyltransferases classified to the cluster IV of flavonoid UGTs. Preferential expression of UGT88D8 and UGT94F1 genes in the petals supports the idea that these UGTs play an important role in the biosynthesis of key flavonoids responsible for the development of the blue color of V. persica flowers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

As for any wireless system the ultimate performance limit is determined by the propagation channel. A particular point of interest is the shadowing effect of large vehicles such as trucks and buses, as this might affect the communication range significantly. In this paper we present measurement results and model the propagation channel in which a bus acts as a shadowing object between two passenger cars. The measurement setup is based on a WARP FPGA software radio as transmitter, and a Tektronix RSA5106A real-time complex spectrum analyzer as receiver. We analyze the influence of the bus location and car separation distance on the large-scale path loss, shadowing, and small-scale fading. The main effect of the bus is that it is acting as an obstruction creating an additional 15-20 dB attenuation. A Nakagami distribution is found to describe the statistics of the small-scale fading, by using Akaike's Information Criterion and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The distance-dependency of the path loss is analyzed, and a stochastic model is developed to reflect the impact. © 2014 IEEE.
[14]: Trucks are one of the most common modes of transport and they are operated in various road conditions. As a rule, all-wheel drive trucks are equipped with special systems and mechanisms to improve their off-road capability and overall efficiency. The usage of blocked mechanisms for power distribution is one of the most popular and effective ways to improve the off-road vehicle performance. However, the lock of differential may adversely affect the stability and control of vehicle because of the unobvious redistribution of reactions acting on wheels, which consequently leads to poor performance and safety properties. Problems of rational distribution of power in transmissions of all-wheel drive vehicles, as well as research in the field of improving directional stability and active safety systems are among the priorities in modern automotive industry. To study dynamics of a vehicle with wheel formula 6x6 a mathematical model of the vehicle was developed in an environment of LMS Amesim software package. The model includes the realization of the features of all major mechanical units of a vehicle: engine, transmission, suspension, drive wheels. Besides, the model takes into account the so called ""external"" dynamics of the vehicle and includes interaction of the wheels and pavement and implementation of possible changes in environmental conditions. With help of the mathematical model we have managed to estimate the trajectory and directional stability of all-wheel drive trucks with lockable differentials for different operating conditions. The results allowed us to develop the most effective, in terms of stability and control, algorithm for control of the power distribution system.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that modern vehicles are equipped with advanced safety systems comprising both automated driving technologies and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, leading to accident prevention and improved road safety.

Despite decades of research in chemical ecology, we still lack an understanding of the organization of plant chemical diversity across species and ecosystems. To address this challenge, we hypothesized that molecular diversity is not only related to species diversity, but also constrained by trophic, climatic, and topographical factors. We screened the metabolome of 416 vascular plant species encompassing the entire alpine elevation range and four alpine bioclimatic regions in order to characterize their phytochemical diversity. We show that by coupling phylogenetic information, topographic, edaphic, and climatic variables, we predict phytochemical diversity, and its inherent composition, of plant communities throughout landscape. Spatial mapping of phytochemical diversity further revealed that plant assemblages found in low to midelevation habitats, with more alkaline soils, possessed greater phytochemical diversity, whereas alpine habitats possessed higher phytochemical endemism. Altogether, we present a general tool that can be used for predicting hotspots of phytochemical diversity in the landscape, independently of plant species taxonomic identity. Such an approach offers promising perspectives in both drug discovery programs and conservation efforts worldwide.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference clearly states that plant assemblages in low to mid‐elevation habitats with more alkaline soils possess greater phytochemical diversity, which aligns with the claim that these regions exhibit higher phytochemical diversity. Although the claim uses the phrase “only regions,” the reference confirms that among the habitats examined, low to mid-elevation areas with alkaline soils are the ones with elevated phytochemical diversity (with alpine habitats differing by showing higher endemism).

The population density and morphological characteristics of urchins at Diani, Kanamai, and Vipingo reef lagoons were also studied as well as the effects of seawater temperature and light on reproduction. Gonad growth started early during the northeast monsoon and reached a peak in June at the beginning of the southeast monsoon followed by a sharp decrease in gonad size of 50% in July and August towards the end of the southeast monsoons. Histological examination of gonads, revealed many different stages of gametogenesis with gametes present throughout the year, indicating continuous reproduction.

The aim of this paper is to analyze and explain the differences in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results of the v3.1 Cut-off system model in comparison to v2.2 as well as the APOS and Consequential system models. Methods: In order to do this, functionally equivalent datasets were matched across database versions and LCIA results compared to each other. In addition, the contribution of specific sectors was analyzed. The importance of new and updated data as well as new modeling principles is illustrated through examples. Results and discussion: Differences were observed in between all database versions using the impact assessment methods Global Warming Potential (GWP100a), ReCiPe Endpoint (H/A), and Ecological Scarcity 2006 (ES'06). The highest differences were found for the comparison of the v3.1 Cut-off and v2.2. At average, LCIA results increased by 6, 8, and 17 % and showed a median dataset deviation of 13, 13, and 21 % for GWP, ReCiPe, and ES'06, respectively. These changes are due to the simultaneous update and addition of new data as well as through the introduction of global coverage and spatially consistent linking of activities throughout the database. As a consequence, supply chains are now globally better represented than in version 2 and lead, e.g., in the electricity sector, to more realistic life cycle inventory (LCI) background data. LCIA results of the Cut-off and APOS models are similar and differ mainly for recycling materials and wastes. In contrast, LCIA results of the Consequential version differ notably from the attributional system models, which is to be expected due to fundamentally different modeling principles. The use of marginal instead of average suppliers in markets, i.e., consumption mixes, is the main driver for result differences. Conclusions: LCIA results continue to change as LCI databases evolve, which is confirmed by a historical comparison of v1.3 and v2.2. Version 3 features more up-to-date background data as well as global supply chains and should, therefore, be used instead of previous versions. Continuous efforts will be required to decrease the contribution of Rest-of-the-World (RoW) productions and thereby improve the global coverage of supply chains.
[8]: Goal, Scope and Background. More and more national and regional life cycle assessment (LCA) databases are being established satisfying the increasing demand on LCA in policy making (e.g. Integrated Product Policy, IPP) and in industry. In order to create harmonised datasets in such unified databases, a common understanding and common rules are required. This paper describes major requirements on the way towards an ideal national background LCA database in terms of co-operation, but also in terms of life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) and impact assessment (LCIA) methodology. Methods. A classification of disputed methodological issues is made according to their consensus potential. In LCI, three main areas of dissent are identified where consensus seems hardly possible, namely system modelling (consequential versus attributional), allocation (including recycling) and reporting (transparency and progressiveness). In LCIA the time aspect is added to the well-known value judgements of the weighting step. Results and Discussions. It is concluded that LCA methodology should rather allow for plurality than to urge harmonisation in any case. A series of questions is proposed to identify the most appropriate content of the LCA background database or the most appropriate LCI dataset. The questions help to identify the best suited approach in modelling the product system in general and multioutput and recycling processes in particular. They additionally help to clarify the position with regard to time preferences in LCIA. Intentionally, the answers to these questions are not attributed to particular goal and scope definitions, although some recommendations and clarifying explanations are provided. Recommendations and Perspective. It is concluded that there is not one single ideal background database content. Value judgements are also present in LCI modelling and require pluralistic solutions; solutions possibly based on the same primary data. It is recommended to focus the methodological discussion on aspects where consensus is within reach, sensible and of added value for all parties. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses Version 3 of ecoinvent, highlighting that it includes new data, updated modeling principles, and introduces multiple system models such as the ""Cut-off"" (replicating the attributional approach), ""APOS,"" and ""Consequential"" models.

However, compliance with this diet is poor, probably because of dietary intake underestimation. Therefore, we compared electrolyte intake as estimated from dietary recall with a 24-h urinary excretion. Methods: Thirty-six patients (26 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 46 ± 8 y participated in the study. All participants had essential hypertension and were on no drug therapy (n = 20) or non-diuretic monotherapy (n = 16). Patients were instructed to consume a low-sodium (50 mmol/d), high-potassium (supplementation with 30 to 60 mmol/d), and high-calcium (1000 mg/d) diet. Compliance with the diet was assessed at baseline and then 1, 2, and 3 mo after starting the diet. Sodium, potassium, and calcium intakes were carefully estimated from patients' dietary recall and 24-h urinary collection. Results: Estimated sodium intake significantly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.43 P < 0.001). However, estimated sodium intake was lower than urinary sodium excretion by 34% at baseline and by 47% after 3 mo of dieting (P < 0.05). Estimated potassium intake correlated with 24-h urinary excretion. Estimated calcium intake significantly increased from 933 ± 83 mg/d to 1029 ± 171 mg/d (P < 0.05). Calcium intake derived from patients' recall far exceeded and only slightly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.23, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Patients tend to underestimate their sodium intake by 30% to 50%; therefore, urinary sodium excretion is more accurate to assess sodium intake.

This extensive data coverage helps in accurately assessing the environmental impacts of various products and processes .","[5] Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become widely recognized as an effective tool for assessing the resource use, environmental burdens, and human health impacts connected with the complete life cycle of products, processes, and activities. This systems approach enables decision-makers to identify environmental hot spots, as well as improve industrial systems without shifting burdens elsewhere. An LCA begins with a clearly stated goal. The goal helps to establish the study boundaries and guides the data collection efforts. The ISO standard provides a general framework for conducting an LCA, but it is open to much interpretation by the practitioner. LCAs can produce different results even if the same product seems to be the focus of the study. Numerous factors might account for such differences, including different goal statements, differ ent functional units, different boundaries, and different assumptions used to model the data. The UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative developed a guidance document for Organizational LCA, which provides guidance to enable organizations to more easily and more effectively apply ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 at the organizational level. [11] The interest in environmental assessments about agricultural processes is high and asks for tools for accurate impact evaluations. The methodology commonly used in these studies is the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), of which the inventory phase (Life Cycle Inventory – LCI) is the essential and most complex step to fulfil, for agricultural productions in particular. The reason is that taking into account local variables such as soil texture and mechanical operative solutions for the agro-mechanical operations is difficult. The aim of this study was to perform a case study to quantify the environmental impacts through LCA of alternative ploughing solutions and to quantify the differences that occur when an analysis is fulfilled with inventories completed with two different tools. First, when a database furnishes average data (Ecoinvent) and, secondly, when the inventory is completed with a tool that considers local variables. In particular, the used new tool is ENVIAM (ENVironmental Inventory of Agricultural Machinery operations), which was developed to take into account local variables. Finally, a subsequent goal was to quantify the environmental impacts through LCA of alternative ploughing solutions. Using ENVIAM, mouldboard ploughs were compared with slatted ploughs and variables such as the number of ploughshares, the field shape ratio (i.e. the ratio of field length and width considering regular quadrangles) and soil texture differed. Fuel consumption and exhaust gases emissions were calculated as function of working time, engine load and European Standard Emissive Stage. The functional unit was ""1 ha tilled in a primary soil tillage operation appropriately and completely carried out"" and the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) characterization method was used for the impact assessment. The most common implement present in Northern Italy, the 3 ploughshares mouldboard plough, was considered as baseline scenario. When working on medium texture soils, discrepancies with Ecoinvent were not negligible (less than 9% for Climate Change and Ozone Depletion). However, they resulted even 2–3 times higher for Particulate Matter and Mineral and Fossil Resources Depletion. Instead, when soil texture differed, dissimilarities were considerably higher. For example, Climate Change impact category ranged between −46.2% and +108.1% of the identified baseline case (with sandy and clay soils, respectively). [19] Supplying adequate human nutrition within ecosystem carrying capacities is a key element in the global environmental sustainability challenge. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has been used effectively to evaluate the environmental impacts of food production value chains and to identify opportunities for targeted improvement strategies. Dietary choices and resulting consumption patterns are the drivers of production, however, and a consumption-oriented life cycle perspective is useful in understanding the environmental implications of diet choices. This review identifies 32 studies that use an LCA framework to evaluate the environmental impact of diets or meals. It highlights the state of the art, emerging methodological trends and current challenges and limitations to such diet-level LCA studies. A wide range of bases for analysis and comparison (i.e., functional units) have been employed in LCAs of foods and diet; we conceptually map appropriate functional unit choices to research aims and scope and argue for a need to move in the direction of a more sophisticated and comprehensive nutritional basis in order to link nutritional health and environmental objectives. Nutritional quality indices are reviewed as potential approaches, but refinement through ongoing collaborative research between environmental and nutritional sciences is necessary.

More and more national and regional life cycle assessment (LCA) databases are being established satisfying the increasing demand on LCA in policy making (e.g. Integrated Product Policy, IPP) and in industry. In order to create harmonised datasets in such unified databases, a common understanding and common rules are required. This paper describes major requirements on the way towards an ideal national background LCA database in terms of co-operation, but also in terms of life cycle inventory analysis (LCI) and impact assessment (LCIA) methodology. Methods. A classification of disputed methodological issues is made according to their consensus potential. In LCI, three main areas of dissent are identified where consensus seems hardly possible, namely system modelling (consequential versus attributional), allocation (including recycling) and reporting (transparency and progressiveness). In LCIA the time aspect is added to the well-known value judgements of the weighting step. Results and Discussions. It is concluded that LCA methodology should rather allow for plurality than to urge harmonisation in any case. A series of questions is proposed to identify the most appropriate content of the LCA background database or the most appropriate LCI dataset. The questions help to identify the best suited approach in modelling the product system in general and multioutput and recycling processes in particular. They additionally help to clarify the position with regard to time preferences in LCIA. Intentionally, the answers to these questions are not attributed to particular goal and scope definitions, although some recommendations and clarifying explanations are provided. Recommendations and Perspective. It is concluded that there is not one single ideal background database content.

s_1098,Contradiction,"General Ultrasound Image Segmentation: Challenges in Ultrasound Imaging: Ultrasound images are often plagued by low contrast and speckle noise, which makes segmentation nearly impossible, as no effective methods currently exist .","Segmentation is a most important but difficult step in ultrasound image analysis. For the speckle noise and the tissue intensity inhomogeneities in the medical ultrasound images, the conventional segmentation approaches based on intensity or intensity-statistics do not work well. Current studies to reduce the speckle noise are failed in boundary preserving. And the researches on intensity inhomogeneites can not obtain the complete structure. In this paper, a new segmental method combined Markov random field (MRF) model with morphological image processing is proposed to cover the shortages above. MRF step is used to estimate the label image and morphological image processing makes the region-of-interest (ROI) complete to get a complete tissue. This algorithm is insensitive to speckle noise. Experimental results on synthetic images and ultrasound images show that this algorithm works successfully in MRF model and can correctly identify the tissues in the medical ultrasound images. © 2007 IEEE.
[4]: Segmentation of ultrasound images is a challenging task due to the lower contrast and the speckle noise. Active contour is one of the most widely used techniques for ultrasound image segmentation. This method has drawbacks such as the predefined initial curve position and the number of contour points to be considered. A new active contour segmentation for extracting the intima media layer and plaque in the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) ultrasound images is presented in this paper. This paper has proposed a fuzzy weighted graph based active contour segmentation technique to overcome all these drawbacks. The proposed method is used for segmenting Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) and plaque in common carotid artery B-mode ultrasound images to assess the risk of stroke in the human subject under investigation. Using canny edge detection and connected component analysis methods, the initial contour was determined and applied as input to the proposed active contour segmentation algorithm. The proposed algorithm was compared with five conventional methods. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has produced better results than traditional methods. The overall probability of error achieved by the proposed algorithm was 5.28%, which was very less compared to other conventional methods.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that segmentation of ultrasound images is nearly impossible due to challenges such as low contrast and speckle noise because no effective methods currently exist. However, the reference acknowledges these challenges but goes on to describe new algorithmic methods (one based on a Markov random field model combined with morphological image processing and another using a fuzzy weighted graph based active contour technique) that have demonstrated success in identifying tissues in ultrasound images.

i_833,Contradiction,"Gasoline engines, especially those using low octane fuels, tend to have lower HC emissions .","This paper studies the combustion and emission characteristics of three low octane fuels: naphtha, the blend of gasoline and diesel (G70D30), and the blend of gasoline and n-heptane (G70H30) in Multiple Premixed Compression Ignition (MPCI) mode. A commercial diesel fuel is also tested in conventional diesel combustion mode and double injection mode as a comparison. The study is carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine with a compression ratio of 16.7. By varying the common rail pressure, the effect of injection pressure on combustion and emissions is investigated.The results illustrate that the combustion delay of the gasoline-type fuels is extended with the increase of injection pressure. The soot emission decreases at high injection pressure with a penalty of higher CO and HC emissions. Increasing the injection pressure also reduces the particle number in accumulation mode, but produces more in nucleation mode. Among the test fuels, naphtha has the lowest NO<inf>x</inf> emission due to low combustion temperature but the highest CO and HC emissions. There is no significant difference in particle size distribution for the three fuels. The indicated thermal efficiency of gasoline-type fuels increases with the rise of injection pressure and is higher than that of diesel at high injection pressure. Naphtha has the highest efficiency as a result of its low heat transfer and exhaust loss.The diesel fuel has lower CO and HC emissions than the gasoline-type fuels do, but much higher pressure rise rate, NO<inf>x</inf> and soot emissions due to high combustion temperature and poor premixing. Therefore, the low octane gasoline fuels are more suitable than the diesel for compression ignition engines in terms of the emissions.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that gasoline engines with low octane fuels tend to have lower HC emissions. However, the reference indicates that among the test fuels, gasoline-type fuels (such as naphtha) show higher HC emissions—naphtha, in fact, produces the highest CO and HC emissions. Additionally, the reference states that diesel fuel has lower HC emissions compared to gasoline-type fuels. This directly contradicts the claim.

However, it is associated with a higher risk of presenting some nutritional deficiencies. These deficiencies are especially relevant after mixed or malabsorptive procedures. Deficiencies in micronutrients after bariatric procedures are a known threat if not corrected appropriately. Though zinc deficiency is not considered among the most frequent deficiencies after bariatric surgery, several studies have shown that its frequency might overcome 10%, even after restrictive procedures and in patients with multivitamin supplements intake.Zinc is the second most prevalent trace found in the human body after iron. It is essential for normal cell function and metabolism, playing a central role in over 300 enzymatic reactions, and protects cells from free radical damage. The central role of zinc in cell growth and differentiation explains the dramatic effect of zinc deficiency in tissues with a rapid cell turnover such as hair growth. In recent years much interest has been generated by the possibility that subclinical zinc deficiency may significantly increase the incidence of and morbidity and mortality from diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. Clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism, oligospermia, alopecia, dysgeusia, immune dysfunction, night blindness, impaired wound healing, and various skin lesions. After bariatric surgery, zinc deficiency is often associated with other micronutrients deficiencies, mainly iron. It has been demonstrated that zinc and iron levels, both within the normal range, but close to the minimum level of the range, can be associated with hair loss, mainly between the 6th and 9th postoperative month. For the evaluation of zinc status, plasma levels are generally a good index of zinc status in healthy individuals. Zinc supplements are usually indicated for patients with low zinc levels, depending upon the clinical context. In obese patients after bariatric surgery, zinc supplementation can be considered even in patients with serum levels within the normal range, when iron levels are also close to the minimum value of normality and the patient complain of alopecia.
[5]: The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity is associated with an increase of obesity surgery and metabolic surgery as well. Several surgical and especially metabolic problems after restrictive and malabsorptive bariatric procedures will be noted in these patients. Restrictive bariatric procedures are associated with pouch dilatation or band migration after gastric banding or a severe reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy. The most commonly deficiencies after restrictive procedures are deficiencies of B-vitamins. Iron, folate, vitamin B1 and B12 and vita-min D deficiencies are associated with the malabsorptive procedure like biliopancreatic diversion, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery require medical follow-up lifelong for reasons that are often determined by the type of surgical procedure performed. The majority of this report will deal with the metabolic problems associated with the bariatric procedures. Patients should be carefully screened and encouraged to consume vitamin and mineral supplementation after surgery, immediately. © 2012.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference explains that bariatric surgery is associated with nutritional deficiencies, notably in micronutrients such as zinc and vitamins, and it highlights the clinical consequences (including skin lesions) of such deficiencies.

However, actual empirical research works in this research area are limited. This paper reports the first stage of a research study, which aims to identify and assess the principal risks for the delivery of PPP projects in China and to address their proper risk allocation between the private and public sectors. An empirical questionnaire survey was designed to examine the relative importance of different risk factors and to analyze the allocation of risk factors to different parties in PPP projects. A total of 580 questionnaires were sent out, and a total of 105 valid responses were obtained for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to investigate whether significant difference in perception existed first between the private and public sectors and second between industrial practitioners and academics in China. The empirical findings show that the three most important risk factors for PPP projects in China are (1)government intervention; (2)government corruption; and (3)poor public decision-making processes. These findings reveal that the Chinese government intervention and corruption may be the major obstacles to the success of PPP projects in China. A major cause for these risks may be attributed to inefficient legislative and supervisory systems for PPP projects in China. After conducting the Mann-Whitney U test on the 105 survey respondents, the empirical findings indicate that the perceptions of all 34 risk factors in China between the private and public sectors were not significantly different. Similarly, there were no significant differences between academics and industrial practitioners except that the former perceived the problem of government corruption to be more severe than did the latter. For risk allocation, the empirical results indicate that the public and private sectors were in general consensus with most of the risks identified. The major risks that the public sector preferred to accept are within the systematic risk category, especially political, legal, and social risks. The private sector preferred to retain the principal risks within the specific project risk category, especially construction, operation, and relationship risks, in addition to economic risks within systematic risk category. The remaining risk, environment risk, is preferred to be shared between the two sectors.

Milk production, feed intake, dry matter (DM) intake, weight gain, water intake and water intake from cactus pear were evaluated. There were no differences (P > 0.05) between breeds or interaction breed × treatment for the evaluated variables. Cactus pear levels had no effect on milk production; however, there was a linear reduction of milk fat with increasing cactus pear levels (P < 0.01).

These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response.

i_1743,Entailment,Summary: The reduction in NDVI for grass and shrubs during the dry season can be attributed to several interrelated factors: Decreased soil moisture due to reduced precipitation and increased drought conditions .,"Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) is an important tool that reflects agriculture dry situation by inverting soil moisture. The changes of energy balance and vegetation index are two main factors to influence the precision of the TVDI. The MODIS (Moderate....) data products, as RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI(Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI(Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and Ts(Land Surface Temperatures), are applied and the DEM (ASTER-GDEM) data are used to correct the Ts data for the reduction of the topographic influences by topographic relief. The TVDI is then employed by comparison of different vegetation index, where the TVDI is more sensitive to soil moisture. Thus the dry situation in the study area is analyzed during the plant growth time and compared by the synchronous meteorology data. The results indicate that: (1) terrain correction can effectively prevent the decrease of TVDI value from a lower surface temperature for a higher pixel. The correlation between Ts-NDVI index and measured values on May is compared, R<sup>2</sup> will increase from 0.4634 to 0.5859 by terrain correction. It shows that the terrain corrected TVDI can improve effectively the estimation of soil moisture. (2) By comparing the correlation between Ts -NDVI, T<inf>s</inf> -EVI, T<inf>s</inf> -RVI, T<inf>s</inf> -MSAVI and soil moisture, all the TVDIs present the negative correlations with soil moisture. The best correlations between the soil moisture and TVDIs can be always found, such as T<inf>s</inf> -MSAVI in June, July and September 2005, T<inf>s</inf> -EVI in May, and T<inf>s</inf> -NDVI in August. Thus a TVDI feature space for different periods by these vegetation indexes are built for inversion of drought conditions. By comparison with agricultural meteorology, the results are acceptable. (3) Large area of the study area was humid from May to September 2005, drought occurred in the West on August, and humid was located in East on June. Therefore, compared with the measured data, the terrain corrected TVDI model is robust to eliminate the terrain and land cover influences to land surface temperature for inversion of soil moisture in the study area. And it is faithful to predict the agricultural drought condition in the study area during 2005 crop growth season.
[2]: The objective of this study is to assess the influence of drought on vegetation vigour. The correlation analysis based on different vegetation type was conducted between monthly NDVI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the growing season within the Laohahe catchment. It was found that NDVI had good correlation with the PDSI, especially for shrubs and grasses. The correlation between NDVI and PDSI varies significantly from one month to another. The influence of drought on vegetation vigour is stronger in the first half of the growing season before the vegetation reaches its peak greenness. In order to take the seasonal effect into consideration, a regression model with seasonal dummy variables was used to simulate the relationship between the NDVI and PDSI. The results showed that the NDVI-PDSI relationship was significant (α = 0.05), and that NDVI was an effective indicator to monitor and detect droughts if seasonal timing was taken into account.

[3]: Precipitation is one of the important factors that influences vegetation growth and distributions. Using GF-1 remotely sensed images and observed precipitation data, this paper discusses the response relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) in Hutubi County at different time scales from January to December, 2014. The results show that: (1) From a macro point of view, NDVI has obvious geographical characteristics, the Central Plains region has the highest NDVI values; whereas mountains and hills in the southern region and deserts in the northern region have relatively low NDVI values. (2) There is a clear changing trend in the area of vegetation cover. (3) The SPI randomness decreases but the SPI persistence increases with increment in time scales. The sensitivity of the SPI to precipitation is different at different time scales. (4) The SPI has a good correlation with NDVI at six-months time scale. (5)The overall distributions of both basically have the same shape and trendwithhigher SPI values in April and May, and higher NDVI are from June to August. This confirms the lag-time of precipitation influence on vegetation.",Entailment,"justification: The claim attributes the reduction in NDVI for grass and shrubs during the dry season to decreased soil moisture resulting from lower precipitation and increased drought conditions. Reference [2] specifically investigates the relationship between NDVI and a drought index (PDSI), demonstrating that NDVI is strongly correlated with drought conditions for shrubs and grasses, suggesting that as drought intensifies (and therefore soil moisture decreases), NDVI values decline. Additionally, reference [3] connects precipitation to NDVI changes, further supporting that reduced rainfall (and resulting lower soil moisture) would lead to lower NDVI. Although the references do not explicitly say “dry season reduction,” the evidence that NDVI closely reflects drought severity and moisture conditions logically supports the claim’s conclusion.

Using the knowledge of twenty-seven experts, from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, we defined fuzzy sets of four variables (depth, substrate size, velocity and Habitat Suitability Index, or HSI) and associated fuzzy rules. When applied to the Romaine River (Canada), median curves of standardized Weighted Usable Area (WUA) were calculated and a confidence interval was obtained by bootstrap resampling.

Various processes can be adopted for the treatment of organic effluents, including the Conventional Activated Sludge Systems (CAS) and its variants, UASB reactors, Membrane Biological Reactors (MBRs) and Sequencing Batch Reactors (SBRs) [22]. Anaerobic fluidized bed reactors have aroused greater interest since the 1980s. Fluidized bed bioreactors are characterized by the biocatalytic use of immobilized enzymes or microbial cells. The immobilization method most commonly used in wastewater treatment in a fluidized bed refers to the attached growth technique for microbial cells, and involving the growth of a biofilm (cell layers and excreted sludge) on the surface of each carrier particle during the course of fluidization. The growth of biofilm on the carrier particles changes its size, effective density, and surface properties - and, as a consequence, its fluidization characteristics [25]. The fluidization regime is maintained by the drag force associated with the upward movement of the effluent. The maintenance of fluidized beds requires a control of the superficial velocity of the effluent, which depends on the characteristics of the bioparticle - which, in turn, are altered as the microbial community evolves. Thus, in addition to the difficulties related to the maintenance of healthy cultures, as in other processes, there are also difficulties in maintaining the fluidized bed, which makes this one of the most complex processes available for wastewater treatment [22]. Due to the constant velocity along the height, the conventional anaerobic bioreactors can drag the particles out of the reactor (washout) [12], when these particles have their density changed due to the accumulation of biofilm on their surface. On the other hand, fluidized beds in tapered bioreactors (TBR) offer as an additional advantage the decrease of the ascending velocity along the height. This naturally prevents the bioparticle from being carried out of the bioreactor. To optimize the configuration of reactors, and consequently to improve their performance, it is essential to know the dynamics of the phases in their interior. In this sense, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) offers several advantages. This technique is used to simulate phenomena involving moving fluids [4], and is able to simulate reactors in fluidized bed [10]. In these situations, numerical techniques have the advantage of establishing precise values for the process parameters [16]. With the application of CFD techniques, industrial equipment can be simulated using models based on thermodynamics, hydrodynamics and reaction kinetics. Processes can be visualized through simulation results before performing full scale experiments, saving time and reducing costs [23]. In the simulation of multiphase reactors, attention must be given to the modeling of the phenomena present. In gas-solid flows, for example, where the dispersed phase has a specific mass much higher than the continuous phase, the dominance of the drag force on the other interfacial forces is verified. The turbulence also plays a key role, as well as the interactions between particles, which can be modeled considering the Kinetic Theory of Granular Flow (KTGF) [1, 3, 20]. For gas-liquid systems, where the dispersed phase has a much lower specific mass than the continuous phase, also observed the influence of forces such as the lift and the virtual mass [17, 18, 19]. In solidliquid systems, in which the properties of the phases are not so disparate, there is a lack of data regarding the magnitude of the acting forces. In simulations of these systems, solids were usually assumed to be spherical particles with the same diameter. However, in reality, biowaste particles may have unusual characteristics such as relatively large mean particle size, wide size distributions, and extreme shapes. The surface roughness of bioparticles can also affect the interfacial forces [8]. Such irregular particles need more research to correct the drag force and solid stress models for reducing uncertainty [26]. There is a lack in literature of numerical studies on solid-liquid flows. Thus, the present study aims to numerically evaluate the performance of different models for analysis of the interfacial forces acting on these systems. Experimental data from the literature was used to simulate different operating conditions of a fluidized bed bioreactor, using the OpenFOAM code.",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) to optimize reactor configurations and improve performance, which aligns with the latter part of the claim. However, it does not mention integrating BES with nanomaterials or any other treatment technologies to enhance overall efficiency. Due to the absence of any information about BES and nanomaterials in the reference, the claim cannot be fully verified.

s_923,Unverifiable,"Technical Advantages: Prosthetic hands are often designed to be lightweight, which enhances comfort and reduces fatigue for the user during prolonged use . Achieving optimal functionality while maintaining a manageable weight and size is a significant achievement.","Prosthetic hand is an artificial device which replaces human hand lost due to trauma or congenital. Prosthetic hand should be simple for a person with amputations to use and should contribute to their performance in grasping task. The prosthetic hands usually consist of a finger like and thumb like member to grip an object. A number of mechanisms are developed to provide the gripping like adaptive grasp system, cross four bar mechanism, six axis Southampton mechanism one way lock, variable force transmission mechanism, and six bar chain mechanism. The disadvantages of the present prosthetic hands are high weight of hand, backlash in the joint, poor function, noise, and less cosmetic appearance. To overcome the above disadvantages a new mechanism is introduced in which each finger compromises a number of spring and thread system. The springs act as a structure and joint for the finger. © 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.
[4]: Prosthetic hands are desired by those who have lost a hand or both hands not only for decoration but also for the functions to help them with their activities of daily living (ADL). Prosthetic robotic hands that are developed to fully realize the function of a human hand are usually too expensive to be economically available, difficult to operate and maintain, or over heavy for longtime wearing. The aim of this study is therefore to develop a simplified prosthetic hand (sim-PH), which is to be controlled by myoelectric signals from the user, to realize the most important grasp motions in ADL by trading off the cost and performance. This paper reports the structure design of a two-DoF sim-PH with two motors to drive the CM joint of the thumb and the interlocked MP joints of the other four fingers. In order to optimize the structure, the model of the sim-PH was proposed based on which 7 sim-PHs with different structural parameters were manufactured and tested in a pick-and-place experiment. Correspondence analysis of the experimental results clarified the relationship between the hand functions and the shapes of fingers.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that prosthetic hands are often designed to be lightweight, which enhances comfort and reduces fatigue during prolonged use, implying that maintaining low weight is a typical advantage. However, the reference repeatedly notes that current prosthetic hands suffer from high weight and are even described as “over heavy” for long-term wearing, indicating that weight is a disadvantage rather than a design focus. This directly conflicts with the claim's assertion.

s_1407,Entailment,"Advantages of Learning Bumblebee Identification: Comparative Studies: Comparative bioassays and studies on different bumblebee species provide insights into their nutritional requirements and performance, which can be educational for beginners .","Bumblebees (i.e. Bombus genus) are major pollinators of flowering wild plants and crops. Although many species are currently in decline, a number of them remain stable or are even expanding. One factor potentially driving changes in bumblebee distribution is the suitability of plant communities. Actually, bees probably have specific nutritional requirements that could shape their floral choices and constraint them in the current context of global change. However, most studies primarily focus on one bumblebee species at a time, making comparative studies scarce. Herein we performed comparative bioassays on three bumblebee species (i.e. Bombus hypnorum, B. pratorum and B. terrestris) fed on three different pollen diets with distinct nutritive content (Cistus, Erica and Salix pollen diets). Micro-colony performance was compared through different developmental and resource collection parameters for understanding the impact of change in pollen diet on different bumblebee species. The evidence suggests that B. terrestris is by far the most competitive species because of its performance compared to the other species, regardless of pollen diet. Our results also highlight a Bombus species effect as pollen diet impacts the micro-colonies in different ways according to the actual bumblebee species. Such interspecific variation in Bombus performance in response to a dietetic change underlines the importance of considering different bumblebee species in mitigation strategies. Such comparative studies are good advice for developing appropriate suites of plant species that can benefit threatened species while supporting stable or expanding ones.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a comparative study conducted on different bumblebee species through bioassays; it examines how varying pollen diets affect the performance and, implicitly, the nutritional requirements of the species. This aligns with the claim’s statement that comparative studies provide insights into nutritional requirements and performance. Although the claim mentions that these insights “can be educational for beginners,” the reference, while not explicitly discussing their educational value for novices, supports the core idea that comparative studies yield such insights. Therefore, there is direct alignment on the key points.

s_2091,Contradiction,"Microbial Community Structure and Function: Microbial Stability: The introduction of certain substrates or conditions does not lead to significant shifts in the microbial community. For instance, the addition of poultry manure maintains a Bacteroidetes-dominated community, preserving the metabolic pathways used for methane production .","An anaerobic digestion experiment was investigated to evaluate the impact of increasing amounts of ammonium nitrogen due to poultry manure addition on the reactor performance, especially on the microbiome response. The microbial community structure was assessed by using a 16S rRNA gene approach, which was further correlated with the prevalent environmental conditions by using statistical analyses. The addition of 50% poultry manure led to a process disturbance indicated by a high VFA content (almost 10 g<inf>HAc-Eq</inf> L<sup>-1</sup>) in combination with elevated concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (5.9 g NH<inf>4</inf><sup>+</sup>-N kg<inf>FM</inf><sup>-1</sup>) and free ammonia (0.5 g NH<inf>3</inf> kg<inf>FM</inf><sup>-1</sup>). Simultaneously the microbiome, changed from a Bacteroidetes-dominated to a Clostridiales-dominated community accompanied by a shift from the acetoclastic to the hydrogenotrophic pathway. The ""new"" microbial community was functional redundant as the overall process rates were similar to the former one. A further increase of poultry manure resulted in a complete process failure.",Entity error,"justification: The claim asserts that adding poultry manure does not cause significant changes in the microbial community and that the Bacteroidetes-dominated community is maintained with unchanged metabolic pathways. However, the reference clearly shows that the addition of 50% poultry manure resulted in a shift from a Bacteroidetes-dominated community to a Clostridiales-dominated one and a corresponding change in methane production pathways. Thus, the reference contradicts the claim.

s_1193,Entailment,"Application: Helps in identifying patients at risk of complications such as infections and organ failure, guiding the timing of surgical interventions .","Background: Polytrauma patients with a severity score over 16 points are at a risk of development of immunologically derived complications (infection, ""2<sup>nd</sup>-hit injuries""). The aim of this study is to evaluate the phagocytic arm of the immune system in patients with polytrauma during a period of time, which is critical for therapeutic decisions. The phagocytic arm is analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 7 men and 5 women from 20 to 84 years of age who had sustained a polytrauma as a result of mechanical factors. Polytrauma was severe (over 16 points ISS - Injury Severity Score) in all of the cases. All patients were studied on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day after trauma. Nine CNS -injured patients (isolated injury) and eleven healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. Results: A statistically significant and higher individual cellular phagocytic activity (number of bacteria per cell) was observed in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day when compared to CNS -injured patients. The percentages of granulocytes showing phagocytosis in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower when compared to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. The percentages of granulocytes showing enzymatic activity in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower comparing to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. Statistically significant and higher enzymatic activity of granulocytes was observed on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day in polytrauma patients when compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: A significant deficiency of the phagocytic arm was observed during a period of time, which is critical for definitive surgical interventions in polytrauma patients. The phagocytic arm shouldbe analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explains that polytrauma patients at risk of immunologically derived complications (specifically mentioning infection and ""2nd-hit injuries"") are evaluated for their phagocytic activity to help decide the timing of definitive surgery. This aligns with the claim that the application helps identify patients at risk of complications and guides the timing of surgical interventions. Although the reference does not explicitly state ""organ failure,"" the focus on complications and timing in a critical period supports the key aspects of the claim.
