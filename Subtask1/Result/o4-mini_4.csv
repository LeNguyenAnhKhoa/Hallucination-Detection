s_7,Contradiction,"Chatbots should offer responsive interactions, simple steps to trigger actions, humanized conversations, and personalized recommendations, as these features are universally effective for all types of businesses, not just SMEs, to enhance user engagement and satisfaction .","Purpose: Chatbots have been widely adopted to create more positive customer experiences as customers now spend more time in digital environments. Despite the technological advancement and benefits of chatbots for customer service, research on chatbot applications for Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) is limited. The absence of research explaining the struggles faced by SMEs contributes to the gap of SMEs' chatbot adoption. This research determines the features and elements that fit with SMEs' characteristics and their customers with chatbots. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach is used to understand SMEs' needs. Study 1 uses interviews with SME business owners and its customers; it aims to explore the features that should be provided by chatbots for SME by identifying combinations between chatbots' generic features and SMEs' customer characteristics. Study 2 tests features identified in Study 1 and surveys 315 SMEs customers to empirically test featured chatbots' influence to anthropomorphism, perceived enjoyment, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and how they affect SMEs' customer intentions to use chatbots and their shopping intentions.

Deductive reasoning and neural networks are two prominent areas in AI that can support discovery processes; unfortunately, they have been considered as separate research areas for long time. In this paper we start from a specific neurological disorder, namely Multiple Sclerosis, to define a generic framework showing the potentially significant impact of mixing rule-based systems and neural networks. The ambitious goal is to boost the interest of the research community in developing a more tight integration of these two approaches.
[3]: The family of algorithms consisting of fuzzy logic, rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) and neural networks are discussed. Fuzzy logic and gray-box modeling are linguistically interpretable formations of rule based models developed on the basis of the available expert knowledge and the measured data for the process. Herding based optimization is another method of intelligent control, where a herding envelop can be used to herd the heat from the interior of self/healing buildings by transferring the heat. Neural networks, fuzzy logic and statistical process control are model free or black-box methods of control. The fusion of neural networks and fuzzy logic in the form of neuro-fuzzy technique is used for advanced process control applications. Neural networks can be installed in multi-variable control applications and can calculate inferential properties while providing tighter control of nonlinear processes.
[4]: The structure of contemporary AI applications in complex automation domains, such as robotics and autonomous driving, is multi-staged and hierarchical. The overall pipeline consists of perception, planning, and actuation subsystems. Each of these in turn, consists of staged processing. Such systems consume raw sensor data, and process it to respond intelligently to their surroundings, in the pursuit of assigned goals. Further, such systems use a variety of techniques including signal processing, computer vision, machine learning and 'traditional' AI methods (e.g. rules engine, planning, and scheduling, etc.). There may be complex inter-and intra-pipeline interactions that are governed by 100's of tunable parameters, yielding a highly complex system. Optimizing the system-level performance of such complexly interacting subcomponents, is a major challenge for the industry. This paper attempts to address such a challenge with the application of a knowledge-intensive evolutionary optimization framework-Cultural Algorithms. A key component of Cultural Algorithms-which are modeled after problem solving processes in social networks-is the mechanism for distributing knowledge in the population network. Here a new, game-theoretic knowledge distribution mechanism is devised which supports both cooperation and competition between players. The performance of this new mechanism is compared against the de-facto Weighted Majority Win, purely competitive mechanism on a real-world, computer-vision based AI pipeline that supports of autonomous driving. The preliminary results suggest that a game-the-oretic approach is better at combining the workflow stages of the pipeline so as to improve driving behavior than the traditional competition-based approach.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim makes three key points: (1) hybrid systems combining rule-based methods with neural networks or fuzzy logic, (2) usefulness in complex domains like autonomous driving or medical diagnosis, and (3) a forecast that future advances will yield fully autonomous, real-time decision-making AI.  
– References 1 and 3 describe mixing rule-based systems with neural networks and neuro-fuzzy approaches for medical (neurological) applications, supporting point (1) and the medical diagnosis use case in point (2).

Practical Steps for Implementation: Avoid Defining Rules: It is unnecessary to define rules that govern the system, as relying solely on expert knowledge or data-driven approaches can lead to confusion and inefficiency .","a rule based system is a special type of expert system which consists of a set of rules. In practice, rule based systems can be built by using expert knowledge or learning from real data.

In particular, rule based systems can be built through use of rule learning algorithms, which can be based on statistical heuristics or random basis. This paper focuses on deterministic approaches for classification. This paper also features fuzzy approaches for modelling tasks. In general, this paper is mainly concerned with rule based systems that have a single rule base.

One of the promises of context-awareness in this field is the possibility of automatically adapting the functioning mode of mobile devices to the environment and the current situation the user is in, with the aim of improving both their efficiency (using the scarce resources in a more efficient way) and effectiveness (providing better services to the user). We propose a novel approach for providing a basic infrastructure for context-aware applications on mobile devices, in which AI techniques (namely a principled combination of rule-based systems, Bayesian networks, and ontologies) are applied to context inference. The aim is to devise a general inferential framework to easier the development of context-aware applications by integrating the information coming from physical and logical sensors (e.g., position, agenda) and reasoning about this information in order to infer new and more abstract contexts. In previous context-aware applications, most researches focused almost exclusively on time and/or location and other few data, while the same contexts inference was limited to preconceived values. Our approach differs from previous works since we do not focus on particular contextual values, but rather we have developed an architecture where managed contexts can be easily replaced by new contexts, depending on the different needs. Moreover, the inferential infrastructure we designed is able to work in a more general way and can be easily adapted to different models of applications distribution. We show some concrete examples of applications built upon the inferential infrastructure and we discuss its strengths and limitations.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that combining rule-based systems with Bayesian networks and ontologies is ineffective for inferring new contexts from sensor data. However, the reference explicitly describes a novel approach that uses exactly this combination to build a general inferential framework for context-aware applications. The reference highlights how this integrated method improves context inference, supports flexible context models, and demonstrates strengths through concrete examples. Thus, the reference directly contradicts the claim’s assertion of ineffectiveness.

Hence, the access to valuable and meaningful healthcare expertise for determination making is a task. Nevertheless, ordinary Language Processing (NLP) techniques had been used to constitution narrative knowledge in healthcare. For that reason, NLP procedures have the capability to seize unstructured healthcare knowledge, analyze its grammatical structure, check the means of the know-how and translate the know-how so that it may be with no trouble understood via the digital healthcare techniques.

Natural language processing has achieved noticeable progress in artificial intelligence. This gives an opportunity to improve on the accuracy and human-computer interaction of clinical informatics. However, due to difference of vocabularies and context between a clinical environment and generic English, transplanting language models directly from up-to-date methods to real-world health care settings is not always satisfactory. Moreover, the legal restriction on using privacy-sensitive patient records hinders the progress in applying machine learning (ML) to clinical language processing. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate 2 ways to adapt state-of-the-art language models to extracting patient information from free-form clinical narratives to populate a handover form at a nursing shift change automatically for proofing and revising by hand: First, by using domain-specific word representations and second, by using transfer learning models to adapt knowledge from general to clinical English. We have described the practical problem, composed it as an ML task known as information extraction, proposed methods for solving the task, and evaluated their performance. Methods: First, word representations trained from different domains served as the input of a DL system for information extraction. Second, the transfer learning model was applied as a way to adapt the knowledge learned from general text sources to the task domain. The goal was to gain improvements in the extraction performance, especially for the classes that were topically related but did not have a sufficient amount of model solutions available for ML directly from the target domain. A total of 3 independent datasets were generated for this task, and they were used as the training (101 patient reports), validation (100 patient reports), and test (100 patient reports) sets in our experiments. Results: Our system is now the state-of-the-art in this task. Domain-specific word representations improved the macroaveraged F1 by 3.4%. Transferring the knowledge from general English corpora to the task-specific domain contributed a further 7.1% improvement.

Graphite/epoxy composite laminates with different types of damage are also studied, taking into account uncertainties in the measurement and material properties. The results show that the algorithm is able to accurately distinguish between different torque states and changes in crack length in the bolted joint sample. In anisotropic media, the algorithm was able to detect and classify various damage signatures with significant accuracy, using mutual information of two sensors. The algorithm was able to produce similar levels of accuracy when variability due to material properties was introduced.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference describes exactly the use of one-class SVMs with Gaussian kernels for damage detection/classification in both isotropic and anisotropic structures.

The structural responses and loss ratios (LRs) generated using the neural networks were compared with results based on traditional regression models using scalar intensity measures in terms of efficiency, sufficiency, bias and variability.

A successful assessment should provide reliable and resolute information to maintain the continuous performance of the structure. This information can effectively determine damage progression and its overall impact on the structural operation. However, the available sensing techniques and methods for performing SHA generate raw measurements that require significant data processing before making any valuable predictions. Machine learning (ML) algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning) have been extensively used for such data processing. These algorithms extract damage sensitive features from the raw data to identify structural condition and performance. As per the available published literature, the extraction of these features has been quite random and used by academic researchers without a suitability justification. In this paper, a comprehensive literature review is performed to emphasize the influence of damaging sensitive features on ML algorithms. The selection and suitability of these features are critically reviewed while processing raw data obtained from composite material. It has been found that an accurate damage prediction is only possible if the selection of damage sensitive features and ML algorithms is performed based on available raw data and structure material type. This paper also highlights the current challenges and limitations during the mentioned selection.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that ML algorithm effectiveness is “not significantly influenced” by the choice of damage-sensitive features and that researchers use random, unjustified selections. However, the reference explicitly states that accurate damage prediction “is only possible if the selection of damage sensitive features and ML algorithms is performed based on available raw data and structure material type.” Thus, the reference directly contradicts the claim’s central point that feature selection does not significantly affect ML performance.

s_42,Contradiction,"- **Noise and Variability**: While robustness to noise and variability in data is often cited as a challenge, it is clear that techniques like wavelet time-frequency analysis are universally superior to all other methods, including the Hilbert-Huang transform, which is not only sensitive to damage but also ineffective in practical applications .","Dynamic characteristics of cable-stayed bridges are widely accepted as valuable indicators to determine their performance in structural health monitoring (SHM). Although research has been extensively conducted in this area, such vibration-based physics methods still face great challenges in improving the effectiveness of damage identification from complex large-scale systems, particularly when other factors, including operational and environmental conditions, may cause high interference to the vibration response. Data-intensive machine learning techniques have been gaining attention due to their robustness for data classification. In this study, a framework was developed for data-driven structural diagnosis and damage detection using a support vector machine (SVM) integrated with enhanced feature extraction techniques for rapid condition assessment for large-scale cable-stayed bridges. The wavelet transform, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), and Teager-Huang transform (THT) were selected as three representative feature extraction methods. A kernel function-based SVM was used to facilitate the identification of damaged and undamaged cases. Numerical simulation was conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methods applied to a cable-stayed bridge. Results showed that the wavelet time-frequency analysis is more robust to noise than the HHT and THT, whereas the latter two transforms are more sensitive to capture damage/defects. Moreover, for regular signal data, the THT, due to the high time resolution, had the highest concentration and thus is the most sensitive compared with the other two methods. Parameters of interest, including impacts of damage level, damage location, sensor locations, and moving vehicle loading, are extensively discussed. All cases reveal that data-driven approaches could effectively map damage features over and under undamaged cases, dramatically enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of data classification, which will greatly benefit in situ cable-stayed bridge assessment and management.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that wavelet time-frequency analysis is “universally superior” to all other methods (including the Hilbert–Huang transform) and that HHT is “ineffective in practical applications.” The reference, however, reports that while wavelet analysis is indeed more robust to noise, the HHT (and THT) are actually more sensitive to capturing damage and were effectively used in the study. Thus the reference directly contradicts the claim’s sweeping statement of universal superiority for wavelet methods and its assertion that HHT is ineffective.

Chatbots are systems that are able to converse and interact with human users using spoken, written, and visual language. While numerous studies have assessed the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots in mental health, no reviews have pooled the results of those studies. Objective: This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of using chatbots to improve mental health through summarizing and pooling the results of previous studies. Methods: A systematic review was carried out to achieve this objective. The search sources were 7 bibliographic databases (eg, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO), the search engine ""Google Scholar,"" and backward and forward reference list checking of the included studies and relevant reviews. Two reviewers independently selected the studies, extracted data from the included studies, and assessed the risk of bias. Data extracted from studies were synthesized using narrative and statistical methods, as appropriate. Results: Of 1048 citations retrieved, we identified 12 studies examining the effect of using chatbots on 8 outcomes. Weak evidence demonstrated that chatbots were effective in improving depression, distress, stress, and acrophobia. In contrast, according to similar evidence, there was no statistically significant effect of using chatbots on subjective psychological wellbeing. Results were conflicting regarding the effect of chatbots on the severity of anxiety and positive and negative affect. Only two studies assessed the safety of chatbots and concluded that they are safe in mental health, as no adverse events or harms were reported. Conclusions: Chatbots have the potential to improve mental health. However, the evidence in this review was not sufficient to definitely conclude this due to lack of evidence that their effect is clinically important, a lack of studies assessing each outcome, high risk of bias in those studies, and conflicting results for some outcomes. Further studies are required to draw solid conclusions about the effectiveness and safety of chatbots.

Hence, it becomes a challenging task to secure networks of SC 4.0 from cyber-attacks and provide a robust and efficient defence framework that can resist sophisticated attacks. Machine learning-based intelligent detection algorithms are often trained at either a centralized or single server, which makes it difficult to train an effective model and also it violates privacy concerns if gathering data from other servers at the edge.

Findings suggest that librarians do not agree on a definition of artificial intelligence which is in keeping with this emerging field. The survey responses highlight the fact that academic librarians require more training with regard to artificial intelligence and its potential applications in libraries. Other important implications include a recognition that library patrons are interested in AI and that little to no programming about it has been offered in academic libraries.

s_177,Contradiction,"Video Communication Solutions: Cloud-Based Solutions: The adoption of cloud computing in video conferencing guarantees better resource management and cost minimization. Cloud-based video conferencing agents are always able to transcode streams to optimal formats and bitrates, significantly enhancing the user experience .","The cloud computing paradigm has been advocated in recent video conferencing system design, which exploits the rich on-demand resources spanning multiple geographic regions of a distributed cloud, for better conferencing experience. A typical architectural design in cloud environment is to create video conferencing agents, i.e., Virtual machines, in each cloud site, assign users to the agents, and enable inter-user communication through the agents. Given the diversity of devices and network connectivities of the users, the agents may also transcode the conferencing streams to the best formats and bitrates. In this architecture, two key issues exist on how to effectively assign users to agents and how to identify the best agent to perform a Transco ding task, which are nontrivial due to the following: (1) the existing proximity-based assignment may not be optimal in terms of inter-user delay, which fails to consider the whereabouts of the other users in a conferencing session, (2) the agents may have heterogeneous bandwidth and processing availability, such that the best Transco ding agents should be carefully identified, for cost minimization while best serving all the users requiring the transcoded streams. To address these challenges, we formulate the user-to-agent assignment and Transco ding-agent selection problems, which targets at minimizing the operational cost of the conferencing provider while keeping the conferencing delay low. The optimization problem is combinatorial in nature and difficult to solve. Using Markov approximation framework, we design a decentralized algorithm that provably converges to a bounded neighborhood of the optimal solution. An agent ranking scheme is also proposed to properly initialize our algorithm so as to improve its convergence. The results from a prototype system implementation show that our design in a set of Internet-scale scenarios reduces the operational cost by 77% as compared to a commonly-adopted alternative, while simultaneously yielding lower conferencing delays.",Misrepresentation,"justification:  
The reference describes a cloud-based video conferencing architecture that uses virtual-machine agents distributed across multiple regions, leveraging on-demand resources for “better conferencing experience.” It specifically states that, given diverse devices and network conditions, “the agents may also transcode the conferencing streams to the best formats and bitrates.” Furthermore, the system design targets operational cost minimization (and the prototype shows a 77% cost reduction compared to an alternative) while maintaining low delay. These points directly support the claim’s statements that cloud computing guarantees better resource management and cost minimization, and that cloud-based agents can transcode to optimal formats and bitrates, enhancing user experience.

Thus, the trade-off between earliness and accuracy needs to be addressed.

s_182,Entailment,Effective Methods for Early Stopping: Generalized Early Stopping for Direct Policy Search: This approach looks at the objective value at each timestep and stops the evaluation. Advantages: It is generally applicable across different domains and can save significant computation time .,"Lengthy evaluation times are common in many optimization problems such as direct policy search tasks, especially when they involve conducting evaluations in the physical world, for example, in robotics applications. Often when evaluating solution over a fixed time period, it becomes clear that the objective value will not increase with additional computation time (e.g., when a two-wheeled robot continuously spins on the spot). In such cases, it makes sense to stop the evaluation early to save computation time. However, most approaches to stop the evaluation are problem specific and need to be specifically designed for the task at hand. Therefore, we propose an early stopping method for direct policy search. The proposed method only looks at the objective value at each timestep and requires no problem-specific knowledge. We test the introduced stopping criterion in five direct policy search environments drawn from games, robotics, and classic control domains and show that it can save up to of the computation time.

Within this area socially-assistive robotics is a growing field. However, although robotics has the potential to support the elderly with cognitive impairment in daily tasks, the development of usable interfaces remains a challenge. For instance, changes in perceptual and cognitive abilities should be addressed in robotics design because they affect technology use. The aim of the QuoVADis project was to develop a socially-assistive robot for elderly people with cognitive impairment. The semi-autonomous remotely controlled robot consists of a mobile platform guided by a computer and electronic system. The robot input devices include speech control and a touch-screen. The system, capable of social interaction, was specifically conceived to provide cognitive and social support to the user through a suite of applications (task reminder, cognitive training, navigation support, and communication). The purpose of this work was to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) through which these services are provided. In a previous study we defined a set of requirements that were used to design the robot's GUI. In this paper we present results from usability testing of the functional prototype of the GUI with target end-users and the modifications made to produce the final version of the applications. Method: We used a user-centred design approach for the GUI design. Eleven elderly persons with MCI and 11 elderly with normal cognition were recruited for this study. First, the moderator described the purpose of the research, introduced the robot and explained the evaluation procedure. Then participants were asked to complete a series of tasks using the main menu of the GUI and navigate through its different applications. Performance and satisfaction measures were collected (e.g., time to complete each task, number of errors due to manipulation, number of help requests). Tests were conducted individually. Results & Discussion: Findings confirmed that most of the features of the GUI were adapted to the needs and capacities of older adults with cognitive impairment. However, individual factors (age, education level, and computer experience) were found to affect task performances. Moreover, some particular aspects of the interfaces (icons, navigation system) had to be modified to make the application usable by the largest number of patients suffering from cognitive deficits. These results were used to develop the final version of the GUI. We confirmed that designing and developing assistive technologies to support elderly with cognitive impairment requires end-user involvement throughout all the development and evaluation phases. This study is an example of a successful design process for assistive technologies to support MCI-patients and their caregivers, involving them throughout all the development phases and applying the concept of iterative evaluations.

The problems are only exacerbated by the cloud, since applications no longer have complete control over their networks. In this paper, we propose a design for security-as-a-service for microservices-based cloud applications.

Particularly, in the Database per Service pattern, each microservice is supposed to maintain its own database and to handle the data related to its functionality. When implementing microservices in practice, however, there seems to be a paradox: The de facto technology (i.e., containerization) for microservice implementation is claimed to be unsuitable for the microservice component (i.e., database) in production environments, mainly due to the data persistence issues (e.g., dangling volumes) and security concerns. As a result, the existing discussions generally suggest replacing database containers with cloud database services, while leaving the on-premises microservice implementation out of consideration. After identifying three statelessness-dominant application scenarios, we proposed container-native data persistence as a conditional solution to enable resilient database containers in production. In essence, this data persistence solution distinguishes stateless data access (i.e., reading) from stateful data processing (i.e., creating, updating, and deleting), and thus it aims at the development of stateless microservices for suitable applications. In addition to developing our proposal, this research is particularly focused on its validation, via prototyping the solution and evaluating its performance, and via applying this solution to two real-world microservice applications.

Detection of cybersickness in a VR environment is a substantial step towards providing a comfortable VR experience. Because cybersickness has many symptoms, it has proved to be difficult to develop a precise method to detect it. Visual discomfort is believed to be the foremost contributing factor to cybersickness. Detection of visual discomfort is currently performed by questionnaires. However, this approach is not reliable due to the subjective nature of the collected feedback.

We discuss conceptually and investigate empirically how individual differences in implicit learning can be measured with artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks. We address whether participants should be instructed to rate the grammaticality or the novelty of letter strings and look at the impact of a knowledge test on measurement quality. We discuss these issues from a conceptual perspective and report three experiments which suggest that (1) the reliability of AGL is moderate and too low for individual assessments, (2) a knowledge test decreases task consistency and increases the correlation with reportable grammar knowledge, and (3) performance in AGL tasks is independent from general intelligence and educational attainment.

However, there is still extensive debate on whether there is a distinct psychological process which can lead to grammaticality knowledge. An application of the COVIS model of categorization in AGL suggests that grammaticality might arise from a hypothesis-testing system (when grammaticality is appropriately balanced with other knowledge influences), so that prefrontal cortex damage should be associated with impaired grammaticality and intact chunk strength performance. This prediction was confirmed in a study of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and matched controls. The TBI patient cohort had diffuse prefrontal cortex damage as evidenced by the history of their injury, CT scans, and severe executive functioning problems.

Therefore, it is important for users to be able to play various videos on different PCs smoothly, but the diversity of codec types complicates the situation. Although some mainstream media players can try to download the needed codec automatically, this may fail for average users because installing the codec usually requires administrator privileges to complete, while the user may not be the owner of the PC.

[4]: Meta-learning optimizes an inductive bias - typically in the form of the hyperparameters of a base-learning algorithm - by observing data from a finite number of related tasks. This paper presents an information-theoretic bound on the generalization performance of any given meta-learner, which builds on the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). In the proposed extension to meta-learning, the CMI bound involves a training meta-supersample obtained by first sampling 2N independent tasks from the task environment, and then drawing 2M independent training samples for each sampled task. The meta-training data fed to the meta-learner is modelled as being obtained by randomly selecting N tasks from the available 2N tasks and M training samples per task from the available 2M training samples per task. The resulting bound is explicit in two CMI terms, which measure the information that the meta-learner output and the base-learner output provide about which training data are selected, given the entire meta-supersample. Finally, we present a numerical example that illustrates the merits of the proposed bound in comparison to prior information-theoretic bounds for meta-learning.

Additionally, different new use cases such as healthcare, identity management, etc. suggest that Blockchain has much wider applications. Blockchain is founded on distributed ledger technology that ensures trust through consensus between parties in a peer-to-peer network instead of the need to a third party or central authority. However, blockchain has several limitations such as scalability, latency, low throughput which are the main barriers for Blockchain being adopted by the industries. Of all, scalability is the most critical limitation of blockchain that needs an efficient and effective solution. In this paper, we aim to enhance the scalability of blockchain by designing and implementing a massively scalable architecture for private blockchain-based applications, called ElasticBloC. To evaluate our contribution, we conducted several experiments on ElasticBloC. The results showed that ElasticBloC is a high-performant architecture that scales massively.
[2]: This paper looks at the challenges and opportunities of implementing blockchaintechnology across banking, providing food for thought about the potentialities of this disruptivetechnology. The blockchain technology can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achievingsustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present. In fact, many banksare currently focusing on blockchain technology to promote economic growth and acceleratethe development of green technologies. In order to understand the potential of blockchaintechnology to support the financial system, we studied the actual performance of the Bitcoin system,also highlighting its major limitations, such as the significant energy consumption due to the highcomputing power required, and the high cost of hardware. We estimated the electrical power andthe hash rate of the Bitcoin network, over time, and, in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Bitcoinsystem in its actual operation, we defined three quantities: ""economic efficiency"", ""operationalefficiency"", and ""efficient service"". The obtained results show that by overcoming the disadvantagesof the Bitcoin system, and therefore of blockchain technology, we could be able to handle financialprocesses in a more efficient way than under the current system.
[3]: Blockchain technology is ready to revolutionise the financial industry. The financial industry has various security challenges (e.g., tampering, repudiation, denial of service, etc). Also, the domain of information security has problems related to conceptual ambiguity and the semantic gap. The Corda platform provides suitable technological infrastructure to build the blockchain-based application (CorDapp) in the financial industry to overcome security challenges. In this paper, we build a Corda-based security ontology (CordaSecOnt) to improve the security of financial industry from an ontological analysis that combines blockchain-based Corda platform. We use Web ontology language (OWL) to build a semantic knowledge base to eliminate conceptual ambiguity and semantic gap in information security. Our ontology provides classifications of assets, security criteria, threats, vulnerabilities, risk treatments, security requirements, countermeasures and their relations. We evaluate the ontology by performing security risk management (SRM) of capital market post-trade matching and confirmation.",Entailment,"justification: The reference text explicitly describes blockchain (a form of distributed ledger technology) as “an emerging technology that would possibly disrupt the existing centralized financial systems” and outlines how it “ensures trust through consensus between parties in a peer-to-peer network instead of the need to a third party or central authority.” Reference [2] further notes that blockchain “can optimize the global financial infrastructure, achieving sustainable development, using more efficient systems than at present,” and suggests that overcoming its limitations would allow handling financial processes “in a more efficient way than under the current system.” Together, these statements directly support the claim that distributed ledger technology can disrupt centralized financial systems and lead to more efficient (and by implication more transparent) financial processes.

Blockchain is an emerging and disruptive decentralized technology that has the potential to significantly revolutionize, reshape, and transform the way data are being handled in healthcare industries.

s_258,Contradiction,"Potential Applications of Blockchain Technology: Supply Chain Management: Blockchain is expected to completely eliminate all issues related to transparency, traceability, and efficiency in supply chains, including data tracking and resource transfer .","The blockchain technologies underlying cryptocurrencies have recently gained considerable attention for having potential applications in other fields. This is due to potential benefits such as decentralisation, immutability, disintermediation, transparency and traceability. One of the earliest and most active industries to explore blockchain technologies has been the supply chain and logistics industry. However, the literature in this area is fragmented and lacks an overarching framework to integrate the findings and systematically guide research and practice. This paper analyses 37 recent studies retrieved from the literature. The analysis synthesises the themes into a cohesive conceptual framework by taking the concept of Triple Bottom Line (TBL) as an overall perspective. This framework will assist both practitioners and researchers in better understanding the issues involved in implementing blockchains in the supply chain context, by not only considering potential operational economic benefits but also social and environmental impacts.
[8]: Purpose: Blockchain technology is booming in many industries. Its application in supply chain management is also gradually increasing. Supply chain management (SCM) has long been committed to reducing costs and increasing efficiency and is trying to optimise resources and reduce the sector's fragmentation. Trust has always been an important factor in managing supply chain relationships, and it also affects the efficiency of supply chain operations. To this end, this study aims to examine how trust is affected by the introduction of blockchain technology in construction supply chain management. Design/methodology/approach: This study is based on semi-structured interviews and publicly available information from experts in blockchain and construction supply chain management. Through content analysis, the data are analysed thematically to explore how various types of trust, such as system-based, cognition-based and relation-based, are affected by blockchain technology. Findings: Blockchain technology provides solutions for data tracking, contracting and transferring resources in supply chain management. These applications help enhance the various sources of trust in SCM and provide supply chain partners with protection mechanisms to avoid the risks and costs of opportunistic behaviour in collaboration, shifting trust from relational to system-based and cognition-based. Research limitations/implications: This study focuses only on inter-organisational rather than interpersonal trust and empirical data from experts whose knowledge and cognition could be subjective. Practical implications: Leveraging the potential of digitalisation to manage trust requires that leaders and managers actively try to improve contractual arrangements, information sharing and being open to new innovative technologies like blockchain. Social implications: From a relational view of supply chain management, the extent to which blockchain technology can develop and spread depends on the readiness of the social capital to accept decentralised governance structures. Originality/value: This study builds upon an original data set and discusses features and applications of blockchain technology, explores the sources and dimensions of trust in supply chain management and explains the impact of blockchain technology on trust.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference describes blockchain’s potential to improve transparency, traceability, data tracking, and resource transfer in supply chains and notes benefits such as decentralization and immutability.

[14]: Blockchain is the foundation of all cryptocurrencies, while machine learning (ML) is one of the most popular technologies with a wide range of possibilities. Blockchain may be improved and made more effective by using ML. Even though blockchain technology uses encryption to safeguard data, it is not completely reliable. Various elements, including the particular use case, the type of data, and legal constraints can determine whether it is suitable for keeping private and sensitive data. While there may be benefits, it is important to take into account possible hazards and abide by privacy and security laws. The blockchain itself is secure, but additional applications and layers are not. In terms of security, ML can aid in the development of blockchain applications. Therefore, a critical investigation is required to better understand the function of ML and blockchain in enhancing security. This study examines the current situation, evaluates the articles it contains, and presents an overview of the security issues. Despite their existing limitations, the papers included from 2012 to 2022 highlighted the importance of ML's impact on blockchain security. ML and blockchain can enhance security, but challenges remain; advances such as federated learning and zero-knowledge proofs are important, and future research should focus on privacy and integration with other technologies.
[15]: Blockchain technology has attracted tremendous interest from both industry and academia. It is typically used to record a public history of transactions (e.g., payment/smart contract data), but storing nonpayment/contract data in transactions has been common. The ability to store data unrelated to payment/contract such as illicit data on blockchain may be abused for malicious purposes. For example, one may use blockchain to store the data related to child pornography and copyright violations, which are publicly visible and immutable. Moreover, an immutable blockchain is not suitable for all blockchain-based applications. So far, numerous redaction mechanisms for the mutable blockchain have been developed. In this paper, we aim at conducting a comprehensive survey that reviews and analyzes the state-of-the-art redaction mechanisms. We start by giving a general presentation of blockchain and summarize the typical methods of inserting data in blockchain. Next, we discuss the challenges of designing the redaction mechanism and propose a list of evaluation criteria. Then, redaction mechanisms of the existing mutable blockchains are systemically reviewed and analyzed based on our evaluation criteria. The analyses include algorithmic overviews, performance limitations, and security vulnerabilities. Finally, the comparisons and analyses provide new insights into these mechanisms. This survey will provide developers and researchers a comprehensive view and facilitate the design of future mutable blockchains.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that “the blockchain itself is secure, but additional applications and layers may introduce vulnerabilities” and that “issues like data immutability can be problematic for certain applications.” Reference [14] explicitly says “the blockchain itself is secure, but additional applications and layers are not,” and warns that “it is not completely reliable” for private data and that “possible hazards” must be considered.

s_283,Unverifiable,Enhancements: Genetic Algorithm based Binary Search (GABBS) reduces the search space further .,"Search is considered to be an important functionality in a computational system. Search techniques are applied in file retrievals and indexing. Though there exists various search techniques, binary search is widely used in many applications due to its advantage over other search techniques namely linear and hash search. Binary search is easy to implement and is used to search for an element in a large search space. The worst case time complexity of binary search is O (log<inf>2</inf> n) where n is the number of elements (search space) in the array. However, in binary search, searching is performed on the entire search space. The complexity of binary search may be further reduced if the search space is reduced. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization based Binary Search (ACOBS) algorithm to find an optimal search space for binary search. ACOBS algorithm categorizes the search space and the key element is searched only in a specific category where the key element can exist thereby reducing the search space. The time complexity of ACOBS algorithm is O (log<inf>2</inf> c) where c is the number of elements in the reduced search space and c &lt; n.

s_285,Contradiction,"Applications: Feature selection is ineffective, antenna array optimization is unnecessary, and solving the knapsack problem is impossible .","The fundamental aim of feature selection is to reduce the dimensionality of data by removing irrelevant and redundant features. As finding out the best subset of features from all possible subsets is computationally expensive, especially for high dimensional data sets, meta-heuristic algorithms are often used as a promising method for addressing the task. In this paper, a variant of recent meta-heuristic approach Owl Search Optimization algorithm (OSA) has been proposed for solving the feature selection problem within a wrapper-based framework. Several strategies are incorporated with an aim to strengthen BOSA (binary version of OSA) in searching the global best solution. The meta-parameter of BOSA is initialized dynamically and then adjusted using a self-adaptive mechanism during the search process. Besides, elitism and mutation operations are combined with BOSA to control the exploitation and exploration better. This improved BOSA is named in this paper as Modified Binary Owl Search Algorithm (MBOSA). Decision Tree (DT) classifier is used for wrapper based fitness function, and the final classification performance of the selected feature subset is evaluated by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Simulation experiments are conducted on twenty well-known benchmark datasets from UCI for the evaluation of the proposed algorithm, and the results are reported based on classification accuracy, the number of selected features, and execution time. In addition, BOSA along with three common meta-heuristic algorithms Binary Bat Algorithm (BBA), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO), and Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) are used for comparison. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms similar methods by reducing the number of features significantly while maintaining a comparable level of classification accuracy.
[7]: In this paper the optimal performance of time modulated nine-ring concentric circular antenna array with isotropic elements has been studied based on an evolutionary optimization algorithm hybridized with local heuristic search called memetic firefly algorithm (MFA). The firefly algorithm has been applied followed by Nelder–Mead simplex method for the local heuristic search to achieve the optimal fine tuning. Other algorithms like real coded genetic algorithm (RGA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) have been used for the comparison purpose. The comparisons among the algorithms have been made with two case studies as Case-1 and Case-2, and with two different fitness functions (Formula presented.) and three control parameters like inter-element uniform/non-uniform spacing in rings, inter-ring radii and the switching-on times of rings. The simulation results show that the MFA outperforms RGA and PSO for both the cases Case-1, Case-2 and (Formula presented.) , (Formula presented.) , respectively with respect to better side lobe level (SLL). The fitness function (Formula presented.) is better than the (Formula presented.) with respect to sideband level. Apart from this, powers radiated at the centre/fundamental frequency and the first two sideband frequencies, and dynamic efficiency have been computed. It is found that power radiated by any sideband frequency is much less as compared to the power radiated at the centre frequency. It has been observed that as the sideband frequency increases, SBL decreases to the greater extent as compared to SLL. As per authors' knowledge there is a little research contribution by any other previous researcher regarding numerical computation of radiation characteristics as SBLs, powers radiated at the fundamental frequency and its two sideband frequencies, directivity, and dynamic efficiency for time-modulated CCAA.
[8]: The 0–1 knapsack problem (KP) is a well-known intractable optimization problem with wide range of applications. Harmony Search (HS) is one of the most popular metaheuristic algorithms to successfully solve 0–1 KPs. Nevertheless, metaheuristic algorithms are generally compute intensive and slow when implemented in software. In this paper, we present an FPGA-based pipelined hardware accelerator to reduce computation time for solving large dimension 0–1 KPs using Binary Harmony Search algorithm. The proposed architecture exploits the intrinsic parallelism of population based metaheuristic algorithm and the flexibility and parallel processing capabilities of FPGAs to perform the computation concurrently thus enhancing performance. To validate the efficiency of the proposed hardware accelerator, experiments were conducted using a large number of 0–1 KPs.

2. “Antenna array optimization is unnecessary.” – Reference [7] details the use of a memetic firefly algorithm to optimize a nine-ring concentric circular antenna array, demonstrating improved side lobe levels over other algorithms. This illustrates that antenna array optimization is both necessary and beneficial.

In this paper, we present a learning-based approach for automatic tuning of search-based algorithms to help such users.

s_288,Unverifiable,Search in Specific Domains: Graphical Models: AND/OR Search: Exploits variable independencies to reduce search complexity and may lead to the discovery of new optimization techniques that have not yet been explored in the context of graphical models .,"Graphical models are a powerful representation framework for automated reasoning tasks. These models use graphs to capture conditional independencies between variables, allowing for a concise representation of the knowledge. Optimization tasks defined within this framework are typically tackled with either search or inference. Search methods are time exponential in the number of variables and can operate in linear space. Inference algorithms are time and space exponential in the tree width of the problem. This potentially higher space complexity makes these methods impractical. The AND/OR search space for graphical models is a newly introduced framework for search that is sensitive to the independencies in the model, often resulting in exponentially reduced complexities. The AND/OR search is based on a pseudo-tree which expresses independencies between variables, resulting in a search tree exponential in the depth of the pseudo-tree, rather than the number of variables. The AND/OR Branch-and-Bound algorithm (AOBB) is a new search method that explores the AND/OR search tree for solving optimization tasks in graphical models. In this paper we extend the algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems from the class of Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILP). A MILP instance is a linear program where some of the decision variables are constrained to have only integer values at the optimal solution (we consider only binary integer variables). AOBB can be readily adapted for solving this class of optimization problems by arranging the integer variables into a start pseudo-tree and, then, traversing the corresponding AND/OR search tree. This rather straightforward extension can be further improved. We introduce a dynamic version of AOBB which uses a recursive decomposition of the problem, based on hypergraph separators. The hypergraph of a MILP instance has a vertex for each constraint and a hyperedge, which corresponds to a variable, connects all the constraints that contain that variable. A separator translates into a subset of variables that, when instantiated, decompose the problem into independent components. The algorithm traverses an AND/OR search tree based on a pseudo-tree which is recomputed dynamically at each search tree node using the hypergraph separator of the respective subproblem. The search process is guided in both cases by lower-bounding heuristic estimates computed at each node by solving the linear relaxation (i.e. ignoring the integrality restrictions) of the subproblem rooted at that node. Preliminary evaluation of the structural properties of several hard problem instances from the MIPLIB2003 library showed promise that the new AND/OR search schemes can improve significantly over the traditional OR tree search approach. Finally, we mention that more advanced strategies developed in the recent years for integer programming, such as the branch-and-cut scheme, can be readily adapted to exploit the AND/OR structural paradigm. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference explicitly states that the AND/OR search framework “is sensitive to the independencies in the model, often resulting in exponentially reduced complexities,” which directly supports the claim that AND/OR search exploits variable independencies to reduce search complexity. However, the reference does not assert or speculate that this approach “may lead to the discovery of new optimization techniques that have not yet been explored in the context of graphical models.” It describes extensions (e.g., AOBB adaptations for MILP, dynamic pseudo-tree recomputation, adapting branch-and-cut) but does not claim unexplored future discoveries. Therefore, the speculative part of the claim is not supported by the reference.

Here, bugs are violations of properties in Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL). A fundamental challenge to its application is the exponential explosion in the number of system states. The current chapter discusses the use of parallelism in order to overcome this challenge. We reiterate the textbook automata-theoretic approach, which reduces the model checking problem to the graph problem of finding cycles. We discuss several parallel algorithms that attack this problem in various ways, each with different characteristics: Depth-first search (DFS) based algorithms rely on heuristics for good parallelization, but exhibit a low complexity and good on-the-fly behavior. Breadth-first search (BFS) based approaches, on the other hand, offer good parallel scalability and support distributed parallelism. In addition, we present various simpler model checking tasks, which still solve a large and important subset of the LTL model checking problem, and show how these can be exploited to yield more efficient algorithms. In particular, we provide simplified DFS-based search algorithms and show that the BFS-based algorithms exhibit optimal runtimes in certain cases. [18] Data mining and search-based algorithms have been applied to various problems due to their power and performance. There have been several studies on the use of these algorithms for refactoring.

We also show how a hybridized algorithm of Kmeans and Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithms can aid each other in solving sequence diagram refactoring. Results show that search based algorithms can be used successfully in refactoring sequence diagram on small and large case studies.

[5]: The self-organizing map (SOM) is a common methodology used to capture and represent data patterns and increasingly playing a significant role in the development of neural networks. The primary objective of an SOM is to determine an approximate representation of data with an unknown probability distribution, from a multi-dimensional input space, using a lower dimensional neural network. The approximation by the network corresponds to the topological structure inherent in the data distribution. The classical SOM, and many of its variations such as the growing grid, construct the network based on randomly selected pieces of the input space, where the number of pieces increases over time. We give an overview of a parallel algorithm for the SOM (ParaSOM), which alternatively examines the entire input in each step, leading to a more accurate representation of input patterns after only a fraction of iterations, albeit requiring significantly more time.

s_302,Entailment,"Advanced Techniques: Growing Architectures: Variations of SOMs, such as the growing grid and ParaSOM, allow the network to dynamically increase the number of neurons to better match the input space, improving the accuracy of data representation .","The self-organizing map (SOM) is a common methodology used to capture and represent data patterns and increasingly playing a significant role in the development of neural networks. The primary objective of an SOM is to determine an approximate representation of data with an unknown probability distribution, from a multi-dimensional input space, using a lower dimensional neural network. The approximation by the network corresponds to the topological structure inherent in the data distribution. The classical SOM, and many of its variations such as the growing grid, construct the network based on randomly selected pieces of the input space, where the number of pieces increases over time. We give an overview of a parallel algorithm for the SOM (ParaSOM), which alternatively examines the entire input in each step, leading to a more accurate representation of input patterns after only a fraction of iterations, albeit requiring significantly more time. Both growing grid and ParaSOM, unlike the classical SOM, do not maintain a fixed number of neurons. Instead, their networks may grow and increase in density to match the input space. We present a comparison of results generated by implementations of ParaSOM and growing grid is made, making apparent their considerable performance differences despite having the growth feature in common.
[11]: The Self-organizing map (SOM) is an effective method for topologically mapping datasets. By adapting the neurons to the inputs, the network can conform to the data and form clusters. However, with the Classical SOM and growing architectures such as Growing Cells and Growing Grid, the neurons are simply points in space and do not cover entire regions of the input space. Therefore, inputs that are introduced after the network is trained need to have cluster membership determined by proximity to the trained neurons. The ParaSOM, being a different SOM architecture, where each neuron actually covers a region of the input space, opens up possibilities for different approaches to clustering and classification. An algorithm has been proposed to take advantage of the unique characteristics of the ParaSOM. The neighbors of each neuron are evaluated by distance to determine cluster separation. Once the clusters have successfully been identified, new inputs can be introduced to effectively determine which, if any, cluster each belongs to. © 2008 IEEE.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that both the growing grid and ParaSOM “do not maintain a fixed number of neurons.

QBDSONN exploits the power of quantum computation. It is composed of three second order neighborhood topology based inter-connected layers of neurons (represented by qubits) arranged as input, intermediate and output layers. In the suggested network architecture, the inter-connection weights and activation values are represented by rotation gates. A self-supervised learning algorithm, suggested in this proposed architecture, relies on the steepest descent algorithm. The quantum neurons enjoy full-connectivity in each layer of the network architecture. The image pixels in terms of qubits are self-organized in between the intermediate or hidden and output layers of the QBDSONN architecture using counter-propagation of the quantum states to obviate time consuming quantum back propagation algorithm. In the final phase, quantum measurement is carried out at the output layer to eliminate superposition of the quantum states of the outputs. In order to establish the result, the proposed QBDSONN architecture is applied on an artificial synthetic and on a real life spanner image with different degrees of uniform and Gaussian noises. Experimental results show that QBDSONN outperforms both its classical counterpart and the supervised auto-associative Hopfield network as far as extraction time is concerned and it retains the shapes of the extracted images with great precision. Experiments are also carried out using a linear method named local statistics (Wiener filter) and a nonlinear technique named median filter with adaptive discrete wavelet transformations (DWT) for binary object extraction to show the dominance of the proposed QBDSONN with respect to the quality of extracted images. Finally, a statistical significance of the proposed QBDSONN is reported by applying 2 sample one sided Kolmogorov–Smirnov test with the existing methods.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a quantum bi-directional self-organizing neural network (QBDSONN) that uses neural‐network (AI) principles (self-supervised learning, steepest descent, neuron interconnections) and quantum computation to perform real‐time binary object extraction from noisy backgrounds.

s_304,Entailment,Challenges and Considerations: Initialization and Parameter Selection: Proper initialization of network topology and selection of training parameters are crucial for achieving high-quality feature maps. Misconfiguration can lead to suboptimal results .,"The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a neural network model that performs an ordered projection of a high dimensional input space in a low-dimensional topological structure. The process in which such mapping is formed is defined by the SOM algorithm, which is a competitive, unsupervised and nonparametric method, since it does not make any assumption about the input data distribution. The feature maps provided by this algorithm have been successfully applied for vector quantization, clustering and high dimensional data visualization processes. However, the initialization of the network topology and the selection of the SOM training parameters are two difficult tasks caused by the unknown distribution of the input signals. A misconfiguration of these parameters can generate a feature map of low-quality, so it is necessary to have some measure of the degree of adaptation of the SOM network to the input data model. The topology preservation is the most common concept used to implement this measure. Several qualitative and quantitative methods have been proposed for measuring the degree of SOM topology preservation, particularly using Kohonen's model. In this work, two methods for measuring the topology preservation of the Growing Cell Structures (GCSs) model are proposed: the topographic function and the topology preserving map. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that “the initialization of the network topology and the selection of the SOM training parameters are two difficult tasks” and that “a misconfiguration of these parameters can generate a feature map of low-quality.” This directly supports the claim that proper initialization and parameter selection are crucial for high-quality feature maps and that misconfiguration leads to suboptimal results.

This makes feature engineering for predicting the sentiment arduous and challenging. Population-based meta-heuristics, especially the ones inspired by nature have been proposed in various pertinent studies for feature selection because of their probability to accept a less optimal solution and averting being stuck in local optimal solutions. This research demonstrates the use of two such swarm intelligence algorithms, namely, binary grey wolf and binary moth flame for feature optimization to enhance the sentiment classification performance accuracy. The study is conducted on tweets from two benchmark Twitter corpus (SemEval 2016 and SemEval 2017) and is initially analyzed using the conventional term frequency-inverse document frequency statistical weighting filter for feature extraction and subsequently using the swarm-based algorithms. The features are trained over five baseline classifiers namely, the Naïve Bayesian, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron and decision tree. The results validate that the population-based meta-heuristic algorithms for feature subset selection outperform the baseline supervised learning algorithms. For the binary grey wolf algorithm, an average improvement of 9.4% in accuracy is observed with an approximate 20.5% average reduction in features. Also, for the binary moth flame algorithm, an average accuracy improvement of 10.6% is observed with an approximate 40% average reduction in features. The highest accuracy of 76.5% is observed for support vector machine with binary grey wolf optimizer on SemEval 2016 benchmark dataset.
[3]: Recent research has shown that Particle Swarm Optimisation is a promising approach to feature selection. However, applying it on high-dimensional data with thousands to tens of thousands of features is still challenging because of the large search space. While filter approaches are time efficient and scalable for high-dimensional data, they usually obtain lower classification accuracy than wrapper approaches. On the other hand, wrapper methods require a longer running time than filter methods due to the learning algorithm involved in fitness evaluation. This paper proposes a new strategy of combining filter and wrapper approaches in a single evolutionary process in order to achieve smaller feature subsets with better classification performance in a shorter time. A new local search heuristic using symmetric uncertainty is proposed to refine the solutions found by PSO and a new hybrid fitness function is used to better evaluate candidate solutions. The proposed method is examined and compared with three recent PSO based methods on eight high-dimensional problems of varying difficulty. The results show that the new hybrid PSO is more effective and efficient than the other methods.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes the use of population-based meta-heuristics (specifically swarm intelligence algorithms like binary grey wolf and binary moth flame optimizers, and Particle Swarm Optimisation) for feature selection.

[8]: Making decisions can be hard, but it can also be facilitated. Simple heuristics are fast and frugal but nevertheless fairly accurate decision rules that people can use to compensate for their limitations in computational capacity, time, and knowledge when they make decisions [Gigerenzer, G., Todd, P. M., & the ABC Research Group (1999). Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart. New York: Oxford University Press.]. These heuristics are effective to the extent that they can exploit the structure of information in the environment in which they operate. Specifically, they require knowledge about the predictive value of probabilistic cues. However, it is often difficult to keep track of all the available cues in the environment and how they relate to any relevant criterion. This problem becomes even more critical if compound cues are considered. We submit that knowledge about the causal structure of the environment helps decision makers focus on a manageable subset of cues, thus effectively reducing the potential computational complexity inherent in even relatively simple decision-making tasks. We review experimental evidence that tested this hypothesis and report the results of a simulation study. We conclude that causal knowledge can act as a meta-cue for identifying highly valid cues, either individual or compound, and helps in the estimation of their validities. © Springer Science+Business Media 2006.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that machine learning (ML) cannot effectively leverage human cognitive heuristics (e.g., fast and frugal heuristics), that these heuristics underperform compared to standard ML algorithms, and that a cognitive-inspired approach yields unreliable inference and inefficient decision-making.

[2]: A Knowledge Graph (KG) is a machine-readable, labeled graph-like representation of human knowledge. As the main goal of KG is to represent data by enriching it with computer-processable semantics, the knowledge graph creation usually involves acquiring data from external resources and datasets. In many domains, especially in biomedicine, the data sources continuously evolve, and KG engineers and domain experts must not only track the changes in KG entities and their interconnections but introduce changes to the KG schema and the graph population software. We present a framework to track the KG evolution both in terms of the schema and individuals. KGdiff is a software tool that incrementally collects the relevant meta-data information from a KG and compares it to a prior version the KG. The KG is represented in OWL/RDF/RDFS and the meta-data is collected using domain-independent queries. We evaluate our method on different RDF/OWL data sets (ontologies).",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that data is collected from structured, semi-structured, and unstructured sources.

We compare our approach with the current state-of-the-art type prediction method and report on experiments with the KGs.

Despite their immense success and utility, these KGs are surprisingly noisy. In this study, we investigate the quality of these KGs, where the typing error rate is estimated to be 27% for coarse-grained types on average, and even 73% for certain fine-grained types. In pursuit of solutions, we propose an active typing error detection algorithm that maximizes the utilization of both gold and noisy labels. We also comprehensively discuss and compare the state-of-the-art in unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised paradigms to deal with typing errors in factual KGs. The outcomes of this study provide guidelines for researchers to use noisy factual KGs. To help practitioners deploy the techniques and conduct further research, we published our code and data 1.
[3]: When it comes to factual knowledge about a wide range of domains, Wikipedia is often the prime source of information on the web. DBpedia and YAGO, as large cross-domain knowledge graphs, encode a subset of that knowledge by creating an entity for each page in Wikipedia, and connecting them through edges. It is well known, however, that Wikipedia-based knowledge graphs are far from complete. Especially, as Wikipedia's policies permit pages about subjects only if they have a certain popularity, such graphs tend to lack information about less well-known entities. Information about these entities is oftentimes available in the encyclopedia, but not represented as an individual page. In this paper, we present a two-phased approach for the extraction of entities from Wikipedia's list pages, which have proven to serve as a valuable source of information. In the first phase, we build a large taxonomy from categories and list pages with DBpedia as a backbone. With distant supervision, we extract training data for the identification of new entities in list pages that we use in the second phase to train a classification model. With this approach we extract over 700k new entities and extend DBpedia with 7.5M new type statements and 3.8M new facts of high precision.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly describes open knowledge graphs such as Wikidata and YAGO (along with DBpedia) as being built “either via an automated information extraction from Wikipedia snapshots or information accumulation provided by the users” and notes that “the type information of these KGs is often noisy, incomplete and incorrect.” This directly supports the claim’s characterization of open KGs (including Wikidata and YAGO) as created by automated extraction or user contributions and being noisy and incomplete in their type information.

There is no doubt that the advancement of ICTs has brought both brought opportunities and challenges to developing countries in their efforts to ensure socio-economic development and improve public governance. In the wake of globalization, developing countries have no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges. Despite the fact that many developing countries are taking actions to strengthen their ICT capabilities in both private and public sector organizations, the process has been limited mostly to national and provincial capitals leaving behind majority of the communities and institutions operating in remote areas. This paper took a case study of implementing computerized Health Information Systems (HIS) in the context of the Ethiopian public health care system and investigated the potentials of the new ICT based system and the challenges encountered at provincial and district levels. The findings also revealed that even those with access to modern ICT infrastructure do not get maximum benefit from ICT advancements due to inadequacies in data quality and lack of knowledge in data management and use for decision making and action.

A challenging task in these applications is to protect the privacy of the participants' profiles and communications. In this paper, we design novel mechanisms, when given a preference-profile submitted by a user, that search persons with matching-profile in decentralized mobile social networks.

These techniques can also be applied to conduct privacy preserving keywords based search without any secure communication channel. Our analysis shows that our mechanism is privacy-preserving (no participants' profile and the submitted preference-profile are exposed), verifiable (both the initiator and any unmatched user cannot cheat each other to pretend to be matched), and efficient in both communication and computation.

These platforms can use blockchain-based solutions to treat personal data as digital assets, ensuring transparent and fair data trading .","The scale of matchmaking market continues to grow rapidly. In the current fast pace of life, an online matchmaking platform is getting more popular, and users are only required to provide their personal information and preferences to match with others, which is accurate and efficient. However, as data privacy laws such as European Union(EU)'s General Data Protection Regulations(GDPR) aims to give control back to consumers over their personal data, current matchmaking platforms failed to fulfil the data transparency and data processing requirements, which raise privacy concerns by the society. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposed a self-sovereign blockchain-based privacy-preserving matchmaking platform namely PSM, which enables its users to treat their personal data as a digital asset and trade it according to the matching score with other users. By leveraging smart contract, we carefully designed a trading contract to ensure a fair and transparent trading process. In addition, we build a matching score calculation algorithm, according to which PSM can determine the price for purchasing someone's contact information. Finally, we develop a proof of concept prototype on Hyperledger Fabric and conduct several experiments to demonstrate the performance of the matching algorithm and the feasibility of PSM.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes a self-sovereign, blockchain-based matchmaking platform (PSM) that uses a privacy-preserving matching score algorithm to match users on their preferences.

These operations are often deemed essential, even in cases where a trusted third party is available, as they provide a false sense of security that can lead users to overlook the inherent risks of data sharing .","Privacy issues are becoming a key focus with software systems. Surveys show that the invasion of privacy is among the things people fear the most from the coming years. These fears seem to be justified, in the light of recent events involving the UK government. Thus, according to the EU Telecoms Commissioner the UK government breach European privacy laws by allowing a group of UK based Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to intercept communications of their users for behavioural advertising purposes. In this case it was complaints from the concerned public that made the EU Commission examine the privacy implications. Yet, on the contrary, popularity of various social networking portals, where users publish their personal and sensitive data publicly, is growing. Therefore, some argue that users should not expect any level of privacy in the digital world. Such climes are backed-up by the fact that majority of Internet users are unconcerned about the digital footprint they leave behind. What is overseen is the control factor. Users want to have the right to decide what information about their lives is in the public domain. Consequently, 'one-size fits all' solution to privacy concerns does not exist, as everybody perceives privacy in a slightly different way. Therefore, parties involved in data-handling, including social networking portals, need to research and implement privacy technologies that can keep their customers happy and make the operation comply with local security and privacy directives in many locations around the globe. This paper gives an insight on how Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) can be used to perform private matching operations in large datasets. These operations can be used by data-holders and individuals to compare or to retrieve information in a private manner in cases where trusted third party does not exist or trusted third party it is used trusted for authentication purposes only. Thus, they can provide users with greater control over how their data is used. They include equality tests, dataset intersections, dataset equijoins, and symmetric private information retrieval protocols. Application of such private operations lies in the area of pervasive computing, database interaction, auditing and data acquisition. Here it is shown that PETs based on commutative cryptosystems are most efficient in performing these operations. Therefore, these cryptosystems are examined in detail. Currently anyone wishing to implement PETs based on commutative cryptosystems will quickly notice that such cryptosystems cannot be found in any of the popular cryptographic suites. The reason for this is the fact that these cryptographic algorithms are expensive to run in comparison with other encryption technologies and have limited area of usage in security applications. Thus, the key contribution of this paper is a guide to implementing commutative cryptosystems, using common open-source cryptographic packages. Consequently, this should enable developers and researchers to further investigate the existing PETs and propose new systems employing the notion of the commutative cryptography.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference confirms that PETs can perform private matching operations (equality tests, dataset intersections, etc.) in pervasive computing and data acquisition contexts, matching the first part of the claim.

There is no discussion of false security or user complacency in the presence of a trusted third party. Thus, the reference neither supports nor directly contradicts that part of the claim.

Expert systems is one of the areas where corporations are investigating the potential benefits of information technology. Expert systems are pre-programmed systems with a knowledge base full of information that humans can utilize to make decisions on a given subject. Expert systems, in reality, are computer programs that imitate a specialist's reasoning in a certain field. An expert system is a branch of artificial intelligence that attempts to provide specialization services in addition to professionals by gathering specialty knowledge and expert information in a certain sector. Because of the rapid development of Internet technology, the way expert systems may be produced and delivered has been altered. The purpose of an expert system is to replicate expertise and disseminate expert knowledge to non-experts. Using the Internet can considerably improve this. This was a non-systematic review research.

The main difference is caused from the structure of an expert system that contains the two loosely coupled parts: knowledge inference engine and knowledge base, instead of one tightly integrated structure. The loose coupling allows knowledge base contents to be dynamically added, removed, modified, or even completely changed to another subject area, whereas the inference engine remains intact and needs no modification. We refer to the knowledge inference engine as an expert system shell because it can be viewed as an outer layer program to infer knowledge advice from the inner knowledge base core. The development of expert system shell can be efficiently achieved through the support of logic-based language such as Prolog. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a different scheme of expert system shell development using a constraint-based paradigm with the ECLiPSe constraint system. Comparisons of the two paradigms have been done in terms of computational time, memory usage, and lines of code. The experimental results reveal that the difference in lines of code of the two paradigms is insignificance, but the constraint-based paradigm uses less memory during execution and provides more concise form of knowledge representation.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that expert systems are structured with two loosely coupled components—a knowledge inference engine and a knowledge base—allowing the knowledge base to be dynamically added, removed, modified, or completely changed without altering the inference engine.

[19] There is tremendous potential to utilize new and emerging digital channels of communication to help raise public environmental health literacy. Modern society is in the midst of a communication revolution that is rapidly expanding public use of digital communication systems and tools for many goals and purposes. Yet, there is a plethora of complex, and sometimes contradictory, information concerning environmental health risks that consumers struggle to understand. Consumers additionally struggle with determining what are the most important environmental health risks to be aware of concerning health issues such as cancers and heart disease, and what can be done to avoid these health risks? This chapter examines the growth and influence of digital communication as channels for helping consumers access, evaluate, and utilize relevant health information concerning environmental health risks. Different digital communication channels and platforms are identified as potentially strong venues for disseminating important environmental health information. Guidelines for designing and implementing environmental health education messages are examined to promote the most effective use of digital communication channels to reach and influence intended audiences. Strategic design principles, such as enhancing system interactivity, interoperability, ease of use, immediacy, adaptability, accessibility, and cultural sensitivity are examined and applied to the dissemination of environmental health information.

Text mining is an evolving technology that allows enterprises to understand their customers well, and help them in redefining customer needs. As e-commerce is becoming more and more established, the number of customer reviews and feedback that a product receives has grown rapidly over a period of time. For a popular asset, the number of review comments can be in thousands or even more. This makes it difficult for the manufacturer to read all of them to make an informed decision in improving product quality and support.

This article attempts to derive some meaningful information from asset reviews which will be used in enhancing asset features from engineering point of view and helps in improving the support quality and customer experience.
[2]: Text data, which are represented as free text in World Wide Web (WWW), are inherently unstructured and hence it becomes difficult to directly process the text data by computer programs. There has been great interest in text mining techniques recently for helping users to quickly gain knowledge from the Web. Text mining technologies usually involve tasks such as text refining which transforms free text into an intermediate representation form which is machine-processable and knowledge distillation which deduces patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form. These text representation methodologies consider documents as bags of words and ignore the meanings and ideas their authors want to convey. As terms are treated as individual items in such simplistic representations, terms lose their semantic relations and texts lose their original meanings. In this paper, we propose a system that overcomes the limitations of the existing technologies to retrieve the information from the knowledge discovered through data mining based on the detailed meanings of the text. For this, we propose a Knowledge representation technique, which uses Resources Description Framework (RDF) metadata to represent the semantic relations, which are extracted from textual web document using natural language processing techniques. The main objective of the creation of RDF metadata in this system is to have flexibility for easy retrieval of the semantic information effectively. We also propose an effective SEMantic INformation RETrieval algorithm called SEMINRET algorithm. The experimental results obtained from this system show that the computations of Precision and Recall in RDF databases are highly accurate when compared to XML databases. Moreover, it is observed from our experiments that the document retrieval from the RDF database is more efficient than the document retrieval using XML databases. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim states that text mining is “solely dependent on NLP and machine learning techniques” and that this makes “other methods obsolete.” However, the reference explicitly says that text mining applies Statistical, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing techniques.

s_440,Entailment,"Reliability: Error Minimization: Implementing mechanisms to minimize errors during data processing, such as using distributed computing for data transmission, can enhance data reliability .","This article examines directions and mechanisms for increasing data reliability in computer networks. Currently, the rapid development of information technologies, the rapid growth of data flow, high-quality data processing carried out in network technologies, and the increase in the volume of data lead to an increase in the problem of data reliability. It is an urgent issue to find solutions based on the use of modern technologies to solve these problems. The simultaneous processing of various types of data in information systems, video, audio, text and digital data, creates big data. The variety of data types in bigdata creates the problem of quality data processing, which greatly affects the reliability of the data. Research shows that breaches of data integrity mainly manifest in three directions. In this case, there is a violation of the reliability of interrelated data in data transmission and storage, in the processing of large volumes of data and in the transcription of video data. It is created due to errors created during data transmission based on artificial and natural redundancy. To solve the mentioned problems , increasing data reliability based on blockchain mechanisms for payment systems in data transmission, increasing data reliability based on error minimization mechanisms in video information systems, and distributed computing and parallel mechanisms in large-scale information systems based on methods of increasing data reliability are researched.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly discusses “error minimization mechanisms in video information systems” and “distributed computing and parallel mechanisms in large-scale information systems” as researched methods for increasing data reliability.

Their pervasive use means that they are used in several risk-sensitive domains, where failed predictions may cause substantial financial, economic, health, reputational, or other damage. For such use, most data mining approaches are less than ideal, since more often than not, they cannot produce reliable and unbiased assessments of their predictions' quality. In recent years, several approaches for estimating reliability or confidence of individual classifiers have emerged, many of them building upon the algorithmic theory of randomness, such as (historically ordered) transduction-based confidence estimation, typicalness-based confidence estimation, transductive reliability estimation, and conformal prediction. In the chapter we describe a general approach to estimating quality of data mining predictions, based upon transductive reliability estimation and conformal prediction frameworks. The resulting conformal predictors produce confidence values in the statistical sense (e.g., a confidence level of 95% means that in 95% the predicted class is also a true class), as well as provide a general principle that is independent of the particular underlying data mining method. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

[3]: Today, network malware is the major threat to Internet security. Malware and Bots are exploiting system vulnerabilities to infect systems and control them to perform Distributed Denial of Service Attcks (DDoS) attacks. Malware analysis is a multi-step process providing insight into malware structure, functionality and behaviour that can help to create a malware antidote. Unfortunately, existing techniques of malware analysis are insufficient and have significant shortcomings. In order to successfully detect new infections there is a need to rely on multiple factors; these include malware analysis, traffic heuristics and traffic analysis. This paper will be focussed on how malware analysis can be used and how events gathered from an infected system can be used to detect a new infection at a honeypot. This strategy of malware analysis is based on correlating events from the system memory, system events and captured traffic. This strategy makes it possible to detect an infection on a honeypot that has been deployed to detect zero-day attacks. An application's memory access behaviour can provide additional insight into the behaviour of the malware. This paper shows how to interpret memory access, system changes and traffic captured to analyse malware behaviour. To address the problem of how to conduct a practical malware analysis a 'framework of malware analysis' chart is provided that can be used in the analysis of malware. After performing the malware analysis, the output is used in the intrusion detection engine to identify similar malware behaviour. Future work will include the dynamic analysis of system events and the monitoring of memory access violations to dynamically generate attack signatures.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes cybersecurity threats posed by hackers, criminals, terrorists, and state actors who exploit IT vulnerabilities to steal data, damage systems, or deny services, directly supporting the first part of the claim. However, the reference makes no mention of using psychological profiles of these actors to inform threat identification strategies.

s_449,Entailment,"Key Components of Cybersecurity: 5. Technological and Operational Measures: Implementing technological solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure network architectures is crucial. For example, traditional firewalls can enhance security by segmenting networks and controlling access .","Purpose: In order to leverage automation control data, Industry 4.0 manufacturing systems requireindustrial devices to be connected to the network. Potentially, this can increase the risk of cyberattacks,which can compromise connected industrial devices to acquire production data or gain control over theproduction process. Search engines such as Sentient Hyper-Optimized Data Access Network (SHODAN)can be perverted by attackers to acquire network information that can be later used for intrusion. Toprevent this, cybersecurity standards propose network architectures divided into several networks segmentsbased on system functionalities. In this architecture, Firewalls limit the exposure of industrial controldevices in order to minimize security risks. This paper presents a novel Software Defined Networking(SDN) Firewall that automatically applies this standard architecture without compromising networkflexibility.Design/methodology/approach: The proposed SDN Firewall changes filtering rules in order toimplement the different network segments according to application level access control policies. TheFirewall applies two filtering techniques described in this paper: temporal filtering and spatial filtering, sothat only applications in a white list can connect to industrial control devices. Network administrators needonly to configure this application-oriented white lists to comply with security standards for ICS. Thissimplifies to a great extent network management tasks. Authors have developed a prototypeimplementation based on the OPC UA Standard and conducted security tests in order to test the viabilityof the proposal.Findings: Network segmentation and segregation are effective counter-measures against networkscanning attacks. The proposed SDN Firewall effectively configures a flat network into virtual LANsegments according to security standard guidelines.Research limitations/implications: The prototype implementation still needs to implement severalfeatures to exploit the full potential of the proposal. Next steps for development are discussed in aseparate section.Practical implications: The proposed SDN Firewall has similar security features to commerciallyavailable application Firewalls, but SDN Firewalls offer additional security features. First, SDN technologyprovides improved performance, since SDN low-level processing functions are much more efficient.Second, with SDN, security functions are rooted in the network instead of being centralized in particular network elements. Finally, SDN provides a more flexible and dynamic, zero configuration framework forsecure manufacturing systems by automating the rollout of security standard-based network architectures.Social implications: SDN Firewalls can facilitate the deployment of secure Industry 4.0 manufacturingsystems, since they provide ICS networks with many of the needed security capabilities withoutcompromising flexibility.Originality/value: The paper proposes a novel SDN Firewall specifically designed to secure ICSnetworks. A prototype implementation of the proposed SDN Firewall has been tested in laboratoryconditions. The prototype implementation complements the security features of the OPC UAcommunication standard to provide a holistic security framework for ICS networks.
[8]: Firewalls are among the most important components in network security. Traditionally, the rules of the firewall are kept private under the assumption that privacy of the ruleset makes attacks on the network more difficult. We posit that this assumption is no longer valid in the Internet of today due to two factors: the emergence of botnets reducing probing difficulty and second, the emergence of distributed applications where private rules increase the difficulty of troubleshooting. We argue that the enforcement of the policy is the key, not the secrecy of the policy itself. In this paper, we demonstrate through the application of game theory that public firewall rules when coupled with false information (lying) are actually better than keeping firewall rules private, especially when taken in the larger group context of the Internet. Interesting scenarios arise when honest, public firewalls are socially insured by other lying firewalls and networks adopting public firewalls become mutually beneficial to each other. The equilibrium under multiple-network game is socially optimal because the percentage of required lying firewalls in social optimum is much smaller than the percentage in single-network equilibrium and the chance of attacking through firewalls is further reduced to zero. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that technological measures—specifically firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure network architectures—are crucial for cybersecurity, and cites network segmentation and access control via traditional firewalls as an example.

Training and education programs are unnecessary as individuals will act responsibly without them .,"For an effective Cybersecurity Culture, it is fundamental to develop adequate cybersecurity awareness programmes. Awareness, training and education are the three areas which define a learning process. Understanding their meaning and their mutual relationship is the key for organizations to identify the appropriate tools and methods to induce people to behave responsibly. With awareness we refer to having knowledge of a certain situation and behaving consequently; training is an active and a more or less formal process to teach skills; education is the process of providing integrated knowledge and skills and the means to extend them. Talking of the building of a Cybersecurity Culture, our commitment cannot be limited to the use of materials like videos or posters; these are important in the context of awareness initiatives, but they must be part of a more complex process, whose goal is to induce people to change their behaviour. The success of this process depends on the quality of used tools and contents and on employees' motivation, which has to be stimulated so as to ensure their active participation. Changing insecure behaviour and fostering a responsive mindset is a challenge that cannot be achieved in a short period; this also requires the knowledge of human nature and its mechanisms.

s_464,Contradiction,"Hypotheses are rarely modeled and tested against empirical data, leading to frequent invalidity .","The general concept of the scientific method or procedure consists in systematic observation, experiment and measurement, and the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses. In many cases a hypothesis is formulated in the form of a model, for example a mathematical or simulation model. The correctness of a solution of a problem produced by a model is verified by comparing it with collected data. Alternatively, observational data may be collected without a clear specification that the data could also apply to the solution of other, unforeseen problems. In such cases data analytics are used to extract relationships from and detect structures in data sets. In accordance with the scientific method, the results obtained can then be used to formulate one or more hypotheses and associated models as solutions for such problems. This approach allows for ensuring the validity of the solutions obtained. The results thus obtained may lead to a deeper insight in such problems and can represent significant progress in scientific research. The increased interest in so-called Big Data resulted in a growing tendency to consider the structures detected by analysing large data sets as solutions in their own right. A notion is thus developing that the scientific method is becoming obsolete. In this paper it is argued that data, hypotheses and models are essential to gain deeper insights into the nature of the problems considered and to ensure that plausible solutions were found. A further aspect to consider is that the processing of increasingly larger data sets result in an increased demand for HTC (High Throughput Computing) in contrast to HPC (High Performance Computing). The demand for HTC platforms will impact the future development of parallel computing platforms.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference describes how the scientific method systematically formulates hypotheses as models (often mathematical or simulation models) and verifies their correctness by comparing them with collected empirical data. It emphasizes that formulating, testing, and modifying hypotheses against data “allows for ensuring the validity of the solutions obtained.” This directly contradicts the claim that “hypotheses are rarely modeled and tested against empirical data” and thus “frequently invalid.”

Recently, many software projects adopt an agile software methodology. Still, some software is developed with traditional waterfall methodologies. Agile methods claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree. In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is demonstrated using a simple shopping web site. As a case study, the effects on rework by adoption of agile can be evaluated using the developed simulator. With comparison of predicted rework costs given a balance of waterfall or agile methods for a specific case, the project can be designed more effectively.
[2]: Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals.

The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes. © 2010 by the authors.

s_492,Unverifiable,Agile Methodology: Advantages: Risk Management: Agile can be effective in managing risks through iterative development and continuous feedback phases .,"This paper proposes a method for deciding whether to insert an agile process as part of a waterfall project. Recently, many software projects adopt an agile software methodology. Still, some software is developed with traditional waterfall methodologies. Agile methods claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree. In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is demonstrated using a simple shopping web site. As a case study, the effects on rework by adoption of agile can be evaluated using the developed simulator. With comparison of predicted rework costs given a balance of waterfall or agile methods for a specific case, the project can be designed more effectively.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes that agile methods “claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes” and that the paper’s whole approach is to “evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques,” focusing on reducing rework risk through iterative simulation.

These are well known for their benefits like focus on quality, early business value delivery, higher morale of stakeholders, and the reduced cost/schedule. Also, they can support the earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other Agile methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven software development methodologies. In this Paper, we identify the XP phases and practices, how they ensure product quality, and map XP phases against the Spiral model phases to prove that XP has built-in QA (Quality Assurance) practices in its life cycle, in addition to its focus on productivity. A case study is also included to empirically investigate quality of the product developed using XP with comparison to the product developed using Spiral Model. © 2007 IEEE.

[6]: The effects of varying fuel mixtures and using a lime additive were studied in a 125-MW<inf>th</inf> circulating fluidized bed boiler. A high-temperature aerosol measurement method using a hot-dilution probe was used to characterize the particles and condensing inorganic vapors upstream from the superheater. The particle size distributions of the extracted samples indicate that when high-sulfur rubber waste, waste wood, and forest fuel were cocombusted, the hot flue gas contained no substantial amount of particulate matter in the fine (<0.3 μm) particle size range, although the SO<inf>2</inf> concentration exceeded 70 ppm. Only a nucleation mode was observed, which was presumably formed from inorganic vapors that condensed in the sampling probe. The size-segregated elemental analysis of the extracted samples indicated that when lime was added, the nucleation mode mainly comprised condensed alkali chlorides, while the sulfates dominated the mode when no lime was added. The presumed explanation for the sulfates in the nucleation mode was the sulfation of the alkali chlorides inside the sampling system. When only the wood fuels and no rubber fuel were cocombusted, the SO<inf>2</inf> concentration in the gas was approximately 5 ppm. In this case, an alkali sulfate particle mode formed at approximately 70 nm in the hot flue gas. In addition, vapors of alkali chlorides and lead formed particulate matter inside the sampling probe when using low dilution ratios.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The claim states that using additives (e.g., lime) and choosing alternative bed materials can mitigate fuel‐related problems—specifically, reducing agglomeration and improving heat transfer.  The reference experiments show:  
1) Bed‐to‐tube heat transfer coefficients vary strongly with bed material (sand ≈550 W/m²K vs. ilmenite ≈850 W/m²K), demonstrating that alternative bed materials can improve heat transfer.  
2) Co‐combustion of high‐alkali fuels with traditional silica sand leads to agglomeration and deposit issues. Trials with alternative bed materials (blast furnace slag, olivine) and additives (kaolin, zeolites, sulphur) successfully reduced alkali and chlorine deposition, indicating these measures alleviate agglomeration problems.  
Together, these findings directly support the claim’s assertion that additives and alternative bed materials help manage agglomeration and enhance heat transfer.

The resulting ecological advantages on the one hand and grid-stabilising effects of a nationwide network of swapping stations on the other hand, support the transition to environmentally sustainable mobility. The characteristics of the concept presented are advantageous for its practical implementation. The acceptance by customers and manufacturers can thus be improved compared to previous battery swapping systems. The loan system for the exchange batteries may be designed conveniently and information security as well as data protection will be strictly complied.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference explicitly states that combining built-in and exchangeable batteries “can significantly reduce” the battery capacity required for the entire vehicle fleet and that the resulting ecological advantages “support the transition to environmentally sustainable mobility.” The claim asserts the opposite—that battery swapping is unlikely to have a substantial effect on fleet battery capacity or to significantly support the transition. Because the reference directly contradicts both parts of the claim, the correct label is Contradiction.

It is generally recognized that increasing demand for resources will remain as long as this growth in emerging economies continues. Against this background, Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., Ltd. has developed and released a series of mining machines, including working jointly with Hitachi, Ltd. on the development of dump trucks with AC drives based on the latest technology. Hitachi Construction Machinery is also committed to the planned development and release of environmentally conscious trolleyassisted dump trucks, autonomous dump trucks, and electric excavators. [11] Shortage of big construction machinery is continuing amid explosive buying, as suppliers keep keep margins low after a previous recession. Vendors are appreciating the demand but low inventories for tires, steel casting and other components have left them confused. Mining operators have locked most of their new machinery and contractors needing these heavy equipments have to wait or buy from low-rung buyers. Some doubt the growth of the machinery sector's ability to keep growing at such a pace. [17] The introduction of storage batteries has begun to be used generally in households. When batteries of a certain size are bundled and controlled together, they can be used to balance supply and demand in areas other than for general consumers. At the EMS Shinjuku Demonstration Center, Waseda University, NEC has recently succeeded in building a system for the automated control of storage batteries of consumers from a remote location. This was done by combining ECHONET Lite, which is the standard procedure for equipment control, and OpenADR, which is the procedure for Demand Response (DR) signal interchange. Using the developed environment, NEC demonstrated the remote charging/discharging control of storage batteries at consumer premises, the results of which are reported below..",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses industrial machinery development and a demonstration of remote-controlled household storage batteries, but it does not address economic modeling, time-of-use electricity pricing, demand for battery charging, or net present value considerations for a battery swapping station.

[9] Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a robust modelling tool for coastal engineering applications. Some application areas include coastal inundation (tsunamis), coastal structure design, density-driven flows (thermal plumes, salinity gradients), and sediment erosion and transport. To date, the use of CFD in examining rubble mound breakwater structures has been limited and mainly restricted to porous media models. This approach does not capture interstitial flow effects and cannot predict the incipient motion of armour block. This paper examines how CFD can be used to study wave interactions with these structures, enabling design verification and/or improvements. A new breakwater was recently constructed to protect the Hammond Island Marine Facility from extreme events, but its remote location made affordably sourcing rock armour an issue. To assess whether improvement of the desktop design was possible, a two-dimensional physical model of a typical breakwater section was undertaken in a wave flume. The physical modelling concluded that an approximately 40% lighter armour material would provide an acceptable level of protection. Using the CFD software FLOW-3D®, a numerical analysis of the typical breakwater section was conducted and verified against physical model results. This CFD study focused on qualitative comparisons of potential damage to the armour layer. A more quantitative prediction of damage would warrant a more extensive study using a moving object model to represent the rock layers. Numerical CFD modelling showed promise in its ability to replicate the laboratory physical modelling results. Numerical and physical testing can help address specific design challenges, whereas desktop sizing methods can potentially be more conservative. With continued refinement, CFD may be used to complement physical modelling to support breakwater designs.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: Reference [2] directly documents that vortex‐induced vibrations in offshore (marine) structures produce increased loading, stresses, deflections, vibrations, noise and reduced fatigue life—i.e., damage to mechanical parts and efficiency loss in submerged and semi‐submerged bodies in sea currents.

The assessment of each site followed a set format which include certain key steps; project kick off, full site survey and discussions, with operations and support staff.

Industrial Processes and Waste Management: Solid Waste Management: Systems analysis models can provide interdisciplinary support for sustainable solid waste management, ensuring cost-effective, risk-informed, and environmentally benign decisions .","[1] Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems.

Education and Cultural Change: Social Dimensions: Excluding social dimensions from engineering courses can prevent students from understanding the broader impacts of their work and lead to less inclusive and sustainable solutions .,"Sustainability is increasingly being incorporated into engineering curriculums<sup>1,2</sup>, often due to ABET requirements<sup>3</sup>, but also due to faculty expertise. The United Nations recognizes that achieving sustainable development is only possible if a balance exists between the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental<sup>4</sup>. However, engineering programs can overlook the social dimension by focusing on technological solutions and conflating sustainable development with only environmental protection<sup>5,6</sup>. This paper reports on the evolution of incorporating the social dimensions of sustainability into Engineering for Sustainability, a required sophomore-level course in a Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The course was created in 2003, revised in 2010<sup>7</sup>, and redesigned in 2015-2016. Throughout the history of the course, sustainability was mostly discussed as the application of the basic sciences to engineering issues focused on protecting the environment. Though social issues were present in some lectures, there was little emphasis on social dimensions until the course's redesign in 2015, when the design of sustainable infrastructure became the focus of the course. Activities that centered on the intersection of social issues, urbanization, and sustainable development were introduced in two class sections during a semester. These discussion-based activities have been revised every semester since their implementation in order to improve student learning outcomes, induce more thoughtful conversations among students, and invoke a deeper evaluation of the complexity of the current urban systems. However, it became evident that it was challenging to address important social issues, because of their complexity, in only two class sessions. Developing students' understanding of social and ethical issues related to sustainable development requires full engagement of the course instructor, considerable preparation time, and the development of curriculum that intentionally brings social dimensions of sustainable technology to the forefront. The 2015 redesign of the course included a format change from lecture-based to a blended style that allowed for more student discussions and active learning opportunities. In 2017, additional curricular revision increased student exposure to social issues from two class sessions deeply focused on social issues per semester to at least 80% of the class sessions (even if briefly). The focused class sessions have evolved from a stakeholder debate approach to exercises that emphasize a socio-technical systems framework, stakeholder value mapping, and empathy building. This paper, using written student work, evaluates how the deepening of discussions revolving around social and ethical issues in sustainable urban development have affected student learning and their ability to integrate social and technical issues when thinking about the design of sustainable infrastructure. We evaluate and analyze student work from three activities that represent the evolution of curriculum in this course over the past three years. Results of the analysis suggest that short interventions in this technical course did increase students' awareness of social impact of technologies and students' understanding of complexity in infrastructure and technological changes.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes how early versions of the course “overlooked the social dimension” by focusing almost entirely on technical and environmental aspects, and it reports that only after redesigning the curriculum to include social issues did students’ awareness of broader societal impacts and their ability to integrate social with technical factors improve. This directly supports the claim that excluding social dimensions prevents students from understanding the broader impacts of their work and undercuts the development of inclusive, sustainable solutions.

The effect of two parameters was studied, namely, the fiber content and the temperature of the curing water. Eight UHPFRC beams were tested, comprising six beams reinforced with rebars and two beams without rebars. Three fiber contents were investigated in this study (1, 2, and 4% in volume). The study investigated two curing temperatures of water, 20 and 90°C. The results presented in this paper include deflections, toughness energy, and moment capacity and also includes a comparison with calculations according to EC2 provisions. A minor difference was observed in the deformation and flexural behavior of beams with fiber contents of 1 and 2% (in volume). However, beams with 4% (in volume) fibers exhibited a higher flexural capacity. Only flexural failure was observed and no shear-related failure was recorded.

Likewise, various research initiatives have advocated recycling of construction and demolition wastes and novel technologies to avert their generation. Owing to disadvantages of steel rebar, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) was utilized as potential internal reinforcement in recycled concrete beam owing to its lightweight, non-corrosiveness, high-stiffness-to-weight ratio and flexibility. Our study revealed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and efficiency which is controlled by the fibre architecture. The improved mechanical properties was attributed to the Bauschinger strain-reversal effect, made possible by the effective CFRP tensile strength mobilization, its high bonded surface area and interfacial energy as well as the composite action of the multi-layered CFRP reinforcements. The best configuration (N4) revealed by the simplified linear weighted sum optimization method achieved strengthening (load) efficiency of 402.7%, ductility efficiency of 299.7%, fracture toughness efficiency of 567.1% and fracture energy efficiency of 5713.9% compared to the unreinforced control. In addition, CFRP laminate was 3.67–4.9 times more cost-effective than steel rebar in terms of fracture toughness. Therefore, CFRP-reinforced recycled concrete is recommended for cost-effective and sustainable prefabricated concrete structures.
[6]: Corrosion of steel reinforcement in conventional concrete structures induces deterioration of structures. Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite reinforcement can be used in concrete structures instead of steel rebars. This composite rebar prevents the degradation of concrete structures from moisture effects. Moreover, this composite rebar reduces the structural weight and continuous fiber composites are able to arrest cracks and prevent self-similar crack propagation. However, a number of design parameters such as fiber orientation patterns and choices of constituent material combinations provide a multiplicity of design options for this structure, which requires a priori quantification of progressive damage in this composite structure and its fracture characteristics. In this paper, durability and damage tolerance (D&DT) of concrete beams with FRP composite reinforcement under static loading is evaluated using a multi-scale micro-macro progressive failure analysis (PFA) technique that augments commercial FE stress solvers. PFA predicts damage initiation and propagation, fracture initiation and propagation, and the final residual strength in the structure. The prediction is validated with experiment data obtained from full-scale beam tests. In the experiment, each specimen was tested in four-point bending with different specification. Simulation results show in detail the damage progression sequence and structural response characteristics during different degradation stages.

Whereas, there is a need for cost-effective system that could be used to strengthen steel high-way bridge girders to cope with losses due to corrosion in addition to continuous demands for increasing traffic loads. In this study, a parametric finite element study is performed to investigate the effect of applying thick CFRP strips diagonally on webs of plate girders on the shear strength of end-web panels. The study focuses on illustrating the effect of several geometric parameters on nominal shear strength. Hence, a formula is developed to determine the enhancement of shear strength gained upon the application of CFRP strips.

s_562,Entailment,"Current Technologies and Systems: Navigation Assistance Systems: These systems use ice forecasts and route optimization algorithms to find the fastest routes through varying ice conditions, enhancing navigation by predicting ship performance based on ice conditions .","Within March 2013 a prototype of an ice route optimization system was tested within a two weeks trial in Barents Sea using research ship Lance. The system is based on two main components, an ice forecast and a route optimization finding the fastest routes through varying ice conditions depending on the ice manoeuvring capability of a specific ship. After giving a short introduction to the ice forecast and navigation model the paper will mainly adress the findings on the systems capability to predict the ship during the trial based on a comparison to observations and measured data. On the trial optimized route options were provided for ten different route proposals in the region east of Svalbard between 76° N and 79° N. The routes were specified by starting and endpoint. The route optimization used an ice forecast from a regional model with a spatial resolution of 5km to minimise the traveling time starting from the shortest distance between start and destination point. The main benefit of the model is given by the inclusion of temporal change of ice conditions driven by wind and currents. The optimization algorithm determines the attainable speed on a route option by time iteration including the actual time step of forecast output between two waypoints. Each waypoint may then be moved along gradients of ice thickness and ice concentrations such that the overall distance of the route will increase but the travel time will be decreased due to higher attainable speeds in lighter ice conditions. In order to assess the ice conditions on the trial permanent observations of the ice coverage as well as ice and snow thickness in the viscinity of the ship were carried out and documented. Additionally the ice thickness was measured using an electro magnetic induction device (EM31). At the same time the ship navigational data like speed, course over ground and percentage of engine power were documented. During the trial the system proofed to be a useful assistance for navigation enhancing the radius of information on the ice situation beyond the range of radar and visibility. Different routes proposed by the system could be tried out while in several cases the ship first tried to follow the shortest distance option and was then forced to switch to one of the neiboughring route options in lighter ice conditions. As the optimisation is computed on a grid with 5x5km2 cells, deviations between predicted and obtained travel time on the routes in ice can be related to the effect of averaging the ice conditions and speed over one grid cell. As the data observed and measured during the trial are given at a sampling rate of two minutes they can be used to quantify this effect by providing fine scaled distributions of ice parameters and ship speed for each chosen track. For further development of the system the shortcomings given by the limited number of ice parameters included in the ice forecast could be determined and ideas to improve the quality of speed prediction by using implicit information about the distribution of certain ice parameters within one grid cell may be proposed.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a prototype navigation assistance system tested in the Barents Sea that combines ice forecasts with a route‐optimization algorithm to select the fastest routes through variable ice conditions. It specifically details how the model predicts attainable ship speeds based on forecasted ice thickness and concentration, and then optimizes waypoints to minimize travel time. This matches the claim’s statement that such systems use ice forecasts and route optimization to find the fastest routes and enhance navigation by predicting ship performance according to ice conditions.

Moreover, we monitor the trajectory deflection using three gradually increasing weights attached to the end-effector. When the robot is loaded with the maximum allowed payload, a deviation of 0.77mm is identified in the Z-coordinate of the end-effector. Tracing trajectory information, we train five supervised learning regression models. Such models are afterwards used to predict the deviation of the end-effector, using the pose estimation provided by the visual tracking system. As a result of this study, we show that this procedure is a stable, robust, rigorous and reliable tool for robot trajectory deviation estimation and it even allows to identify the mechanical element producing non-kinematic errors.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes a vision-based tracking system and regression models for assessing and predicting end-effector trajectory deviations under varying payloads.

Thin films of WS <inf>2</inf> exhibit extremely low coefficient of friction in dry environments, and are typically applied by mixed in oil, grease or impregnated into porous matrix of powdered materials, sputter deposition, pulsed laser ablation, evaporation or chemical vapour deposition and, which are essential either line-of-sight or high temperature processes. Solid lubricant coatings are attractive because they can reduce friction-generated heat. WS <inf>2</inf> is a common solid lubricant. However, the use of WS <inf>2</inf> can limit excessive wear, as well as the friction coefficient.

Lubricant Additives: Alcohol Vapor Adsorption: This method involves using alcohol vapor to continuously replenish the lubricating layer, which can prevent wear effectively .","[1] Hard coatings and surface adsorptive/reactive lubricants are two common strategies for improving wear protection, but what if they are used together? In this study, steel-steel and steel-coating sliding was investigated in boundary lubrication of polar and non-polar oils containing a ZDDP or an ionic liquid. Two hard coatings, diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and chromium nitride (CrN), were used. For a steel-steel contact, wear was effectively reduced by using a more surface reactive lubricant, as expected. However, the steel ball wear was increased against a hard coating and further worsened with a more polar oil and/or a more surface reactive additive. The wear mechanism is proposed as a combined effect of physicochemical interactions with the lubricant, mechanical polishing by the counterface, and material adhesion. [3] Nickel-based graphite-containing composites were prepared by powder metallurgy method. Their mechanical properties at room temperature and friction and wear properties from room temperature to 600 °C were investigated by a pin-on-disk tribometer with alumina, silicon nitride and nickel-based alloy as counterfaces. The effects of graphite addition amount, temperature, load, sliding speed and counterface materials on the tribological properties were discussed. The micro-structure and worn surface morphologies were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that the composites are mainly consisted of nickel-based solid solution, free graphite and carbide formed during hot pressing. The friction and wear properties of composites are all improved by adding 6-12 wt.% graphite while the anti-bending and tensile strength as well as hardness decrease after adding graphite. The friction coefficients from room temperature to 600 °C decrease with the increase of load, sliding speed while the wear rates increase with the increasing temperature, sliding speed. The lower friction coefficients and wear rates are obtained when the composite rubs against nickel-based alloy containing molybdenum disulfide. Friction coefficients of graphite-containing composites from room temperature to 600 °C are about 0.4 while wear rates are in the magnitude of 10<sup>-5</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/(N m). At high temperature, the graphite is not effective in lubrication due to the oxidation and the shield of 'glaze' layer formed by compacting back-transferred wear particles.

The solid lubricant coating life was closely relevant to the surface roughness on a specimen prior to the coating process. Especially under a harsh test condition, the coating life increased when the surface roughness was appropriately formed by a shot peening process in view of Sm and (Ry-Ra)/Ry as the effective processing parameters (Sm : mean profile element width, Ry : maximum height of profile, Ra: arithmetical mean deviation of the assessed profile). Spherical shot peening particles were then suitable as the formation of surface roughness.

Finally, the authors fabricated the prototype railway wheel with the flange surface modified by solid lubricant coatings.",Entailment,"justification: The reference reports that shot peening was used to form an appropriate surface roughness (via parameters Sm and (Ry–Ra)/Ry) which directly increased the life of the solid lubricant coating under harsh test conditions.

Lubrication Techniques: Grease Lubrication: Using grease can significantly reduce friction and wear in sliding contacts, but it is often ineffective at high displacement amplitudes and with certain types of grease .","Grease lubricants are extensively used in contacts, usually to reduce friction and wear. Under small amplitude sliding, however, as in rolling systems subject to vibration, there is significant lubricant decay. The present study analyses the fretting sliding response of two grease lubricants subjected to small (i.e. partial slip) and large displacement amplitude (i.e. gross slip fretting). Tribological behavior and associated wear volume were investigated as a function of displacement amplitude. The investigation confirmed that, below a threshold displacement amplitude, scarce lubrication induced significant wear activation, while, above threshold, low friction and a low wear response were observed. A new effective friction energy wear concept is introduced to quantify wear rate whatever the fretting sliding condition.
[8]: Sliding electrical contacts are used to detect the motion of mechanical components. Grease is often used to reduce the friction and wear of sliding electrical contacts. Chattering sometimes occurs at low temperatures in grease-lubricated sliding electrical contacts. However, the causes of chattering are not well understood. We developed a test apparatus to simulate sliding electrical contacts. Using this apparatus, we studied the effects of sliding velocity, contact load, ambient temperature, and oil and grease viscosity on chattering occurrence. The results showed that chattering occurred at high sliding speeds, low contact loads, and with high-viscosity greases. By measuring the displacement of the upper contact, we also showed that the shape of the lower contact influenced the chattering characteristics. The causes of chattering are concluded to be an increase in the thickness of the oil layer between the upper and lower contacts due to hydrodynamic effects and an increase in the resistance of the oils or greases. © 2008 by Allerton Press, Inc.",Entailment,"justification: The claim’s first part (“Using grease can significantly reduce friction and wear in sliding contacts”) is supported by both parts of the reference, which state that grease lubricants are extensively used to reduce friction and wear. However, the claim’s second part (“it is often ineffective at high displacement amplitudes”) is directly contradicted by the main study, which found that above a threshold (i.e. at large displacement amplitudes) grease delivers low friction and low wear. Because the reference shows grease remains effective at high amplitudes, the claim’s assertion of ineffectiveness in that regime is disproven.

According to its structural characteristics, the corresponding TW and radio frequency (RF) coupling power supply and measurement as well as control system were designed. Customizable Ethernet communication protocol was used to control the field-programmable logic gate array (FPGA) for full-circuit signal control and generation, and an 8-channel traveling-wave amplitude monitoring was achieved through a 12-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a 16-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). In addition, dual-plane transformer coupling circuit was designed. The use of traveling wave changed the central reference frame of the RF, achieving the purpose of programmed RF and the effect of TW in the stacked-ring to provide axial kinetic energy. The stability and accuracy of the electrical parameters of the hardware system on the off-axis transmission structure were tested. The results showed that the controllable voltage range of TW power supply is 0.1-100 V and the controlled DC power supply's full range detection and control absolute error are less than 0.04 V.

[6]: Wood-polymer composites (WPC) are materials in which wood is impregnated with monomers that are then polymerised in the wood to tailor the material for special applications. The resulting properties of these materials, from lightness and enhanced mechanical properties to greater sustainability, has meant a growing number of applications in such areas as building, construction and automotive engineering. This important book reviews the manufacture of wood-polymer composites, how their properties can be assessed and improved and their range of uses. After an introductory chapter, the book reviews key aspects of manufacture, including raw materials, manufacturing technologies and interactions between wood and synthetic polymers. Building on this foundation, the following group of chapters discusses mechanical and other properties such as durability, creep behaviour and processing performance. The book concludes by looking at orientated wood-polymer composites, wood-polymer composite foams, at ways of assessing performance and at the range of current and future applications.

s_634,Contradiction,"Impact of Object Detection on Traffic Surveillance: Object detection does not significantly enhance traffic surveillance systems. In fact, these systems often struggle with computer vision techniques to analyze traffic videos, which can lead to decreased public safety and ineffective traffic management .","Now day's computer vision techniques are used for analysis of traffic surveillance videos which is gaining more importance. This analysis of videos can be useful for public safety and for traffic management. In recent time, there has been an increased scope for analysis of traffic activity automatically. Computer based surveillance algorithms and systems are used to extract information from the videos which is also called as Video analytics. Detection of traffic violations such as illegal turns and identification of pedestrians, vehicles from traffic videos can be done by using computer vision and pattern recognition techniques. Object detection is the process of identifying instances of real world objects which include persons, faces and vehicles in images or videos. Object detection is becoming an increasingly important challenge now days as it has so many applications. Vehicle detection helps in core detection of multiple functions such as Adaptive cruise control, forward collision warning. Automatic Generation of Traffic Signal based on Traffic Volume system can be used for traffic control. Traffic Surveillance videos of vehicles are taken as input from MIT Traffic dataset. These videos are further processed frame by frame where the background subtraction is done with the help of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). From the background subtracted result some amount of noise is removed with the help of Morphological opening operation and Blob analysis is done in order to the detect the vehicles. Later the vehicles are counted by incrementing the counter whenever a bounding box is appeared for the detected vehicle. Finally a signal is generated depending on the count in each frame.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference describes how computer vision and object detection techniques are actively used to analyze traffic surveillance videos, improve public safety, manage traffic signals automatically based on vehicle counts, detect traffic violations, and support functions like adaptive cruise control and collision warnings. This directly supports the view that object detection significantly enhances traffic surveillance and traffic management. The claim asserts the opposite—that object detection does not enhance surveillance and leads to decreased safety—so the reference directly contradicts the claim.

A block-based Gaussian mixture background modeling method for object detection is presented to reduce the computational complexity of moving vehicle object abstraction. An adaptive tracking algorithm fused with color features and texture features is described to better adapt the traffic scene variation. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively deal with the complex urban traffic conditions and the tracking performance is better than the conventional particle filter method and single feature based non-adaptive object tracking method.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that advanced tracking algorithms using color and texture features “struggle” in complex urban traffic, resulting in lower accuracy and higher computational complexity.

s_638,Contradiction,"Occlusion Handling: In crowded urban areas, particularly in developed countries, object detection methods that ignore occlusions and inter-vehicle space issues are sufficient. Techniques that do not analyze geometric and ellipticity characteristics of objects do not significantly affect detection rates, even in challenging conditions .","Traffic Surveillance System (TSS) plays an important role in extracting necessary information (count, type, speed, etc.). In the area of Traffic Surveillance System (TSS), vehicle detection has emerged as an influential field of study. So far there has been a considerable amount of research to accommodate this subject. However, these studies almost address problems in developed countries where the traffic infrastructure is constructed to appropriate automobiles. Detecting moving vehicles in urban areas is difficult because the inter-vehicle space is significantly reduced, increasing the occlusion between vehicles. This issue is more challenging in developing countries where the roads are crowded with 2-wheeled motorbikes in rush hours. This paper presents a method to improve the occlusion vehicle detection from static surveillance cameras. The proposed method is a vision-based approach in which undefined blobs of occluded vehicles are examined to extract the vehicles individually based on the geometric and the ellipticity characteristic of objects' shapes. Experiments have been carried out with the real-world data to evaluate the performance and the accuracy of our method. The assessment results are promising for a detection rate of 84.10% at daytime.
[8]: In order to address the challenges of occlusions and background variations, we propose a novel and effective rule-based multiple object tracking system for traffic surveillance using a collaborative background extraction algorithm. The collaborative background extraction algorithm collaboratively extracts a background from multiple independent extractions to remove spurious background pixels. The rule-based strategies are applied for thresholding, outlier removal, object consolidation, separating neighboring objects, and shadow removal. Empirical results show that our multiple object tracking system is highly accurate for traffic surveillance under occlusion conditions. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that in crowded urban areas—especially in developed countries—methods that ignore occlusions and do not analyze geometric or ellipticity characteristics are nevertheless sufficient and do not significantly affect detection rates. The reference, however, emphasizes that reduced inter-vehicle spacing and occlusions in urban scenarios make detection difficult even in developed countries, and it specifically proposes a vision-based method that examines blobs via geometric and ellipticity features to improve occlusion handling. This directly contradicts the claim’s assertion that such considerations are unnecessary.

It is therefore important to take advantage of available infrastructures to maximize the information extraction for each technology. Here we show how low-quality urban road traffic images from cameras, already installed in many cities such as Montreal, Vancouver and Toronto can be used as a non-intrusive traffic monitoring. To this end, we use a pre-trained object detection neural network to count vehicles within images. We then compare the results with human annotations gathered through crowdsourcing campaigns. We use this comparison to assess performance and calibrate the neural network annotations. The performance of our system allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time, making the counting usable for traffic-related services. Furthermore, the resulting annotations pave the way for building a historical vehicle counting dataset to be used for analysing the impact of road traffic on many city-related issues such as urban planning, security, and pollution.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that the object detection system “allows us to consider applications which can monitor the traffic conditions in near real-time,” directly supporting the first part of the claim. However, it does not mention dynamic traffic management or any effects on congestion reduction. Since the claim’s assertions about sufficiency for dynamic traffic management and potential congestion relief are not addressed in the reference, those points cannot be verified.

s_642,Entailment,"Data Collection Strategies: Industry-Wide Surveys and Questionnaires: Conducting comprehensive surveys across various stakeholders in the infrastructure projects, including public and private sectors, can provide valuable insights into risk perceptions and allocation preferences .","Risk allocation in public-private partnership (PPP) projects is currently claimed as capability driven. While lacking theoretical support, the claim is often 'violated' by current industrial practice. There is thus a need for formal mechanisms to interpret why a particular risk is retained by government in one project while transferred to private partners in another. From the viewpoint of transaction cost economics (TCE), integrated with the resource-based view (RBV) of organizational capabilities, this paper proposed a theoretical framework for understanding risk allocation practice in PPP projects. The theories underlying the major constructs and their links were articulated. Data gathered from an industry-wide survey were used to test the framework. The results of multiple linear regression (MLR) generally support the proposed framework. It has been found that partners' risk management routine, mechanism, commitment, cooperation history, and uncertainties associated with project risk management could serve to determine the risk allocation strategies adopted in a PPP project. This theoretical framework thus provides both government and private agencies with a logical and complete understanding of the process of selecting the allocation strategy for a particular risk in PPP projects. Moreover, it could be utilized to steer the risk allocation strategy by controlling certain critical determinants identified in the study. Study limitations and future research directions have also been set out.
[2]: Earlier research studies on public-private partnership (PPP) indicated that an objective, reliable, and practical risk assessment model for PPP projects and an equitable risk allocation mechanism among different parties are crucial to the successful implementation of these PPP projects. However, actual empirical research works in this research area are limited. This paper reports the first stage of a research study, which aims to identify and assess the principal risks for the delivery of PPP projects in China and to address their proper risk allocation between the private and public sectors. An empirical questionnaire survey was designed to examine the relative importance of different risk factors and to analyze the allocation of risk factors to different parties in PPP projects. A total of 580 questionnaires were sent out, and a total of 105 valid responses were obtained for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to investigate whether significant difference in perception existed first between the private and public sectors and second between industrial practitioners and academics in China. The empirical findings show that the three most important risk factors for PPP projects in China are (1)government intervention; (2)government corruption; and (3)poor public decision-making processes. These findings reveal that the Chinese government intervention and corruption may be the major obstacles to the success of PPP projects in China. A major cause for these risks may be attributed to inefficient legislative and supervisory systems for PPP projects in China. After conducting the Mann-Whitney U test on the 105 survey respondents, the empirical findings indicate that the perceptions of all 34 risk factors in China between the private and public sectors were not significantly different. Similarly, there were no significant differences between academics and industrial practitioners except that the former perceived the problem of government corruption to be more severe than did the latter. For risk allocation, the empirical results indicate that the public and private sectors were in general consensus with most of the risks identified. The major risks that the public sector preferred to accept are within the systematic risk category, especially political, legal, and social risks. The private sector preferred to retain the principal risks within the specific project risk category, especially construction, operation, and relationship risks, in addition to economic risks within systematic risk category. The remaining risk, environment risk, is preferred to be shared between the two sectors.

[3]: The implementation of public private partnership (PPP) procurement method is expected to help governments in the development of infrastructures and provides an opportunity for the reduction in the governments' debt profiles. This method has been adopted in Nigeria for more than a decade and with these years of implementation, few infrastructural projects have been developed using this method while some have been unsuccessful. This study aims to examine the PPP projects implementation in Nigeria and identify the most critical factors that could determine the success of such projects. A total of 184 questionnaires were received from public and private sectors' participants in the implementation of PPP projects. An exploratory factor analysis identified seven critical success factors as projects feedback, leadership focus, risk allocation and economic policy, good governance and political support, short construction period, favourable socio-economic factors, and delivering publicly needed service. This study shows that more developmental projects could be delivered through PPP if the government could focus on these main factors in the implementation process. The result will influence policy development towards PPP and guide the partners in the development of PPP projects.",Entailment,"justification: The references describe using industry-wide surveys and questionnaires sent to both public and private sector stakeholders in PPP infrastructure projects to gather data on the importance of different risk factors and how those risks should be allocated.

This paper compares the efficiencies of a 220V AC power feed system with those of a 300V DC power feed system under equal load conditions, as established by the Mok-Dong IDC of Korea Telecom Co. Ltd. (KT). Experimental results show that the total operation efficiency of the 300V DC power feed system is approximately 15% higher than that of the 220V AC power feed system.",Numeric error,"justification: The reference confirms that AC feed systems involve three conversion stages (AC-DC, DC-AC, AC-DC) and that DC feed systems require only AC-DC, yielding higher efficiency and reliability. However, the experimental improvement cited in the reference is approximately 15%, not 25% as claimed. This numeric discrepancy directly contradicts the claim’s stated efficiency gain.

Here, the characterization of the cutting edge radius and the cutting edge microstructure is not possible using optical imaging techniques due to the limited lateral resolution of these systems. Additionally, intermittent off machine measurements are not possible in this order of magnitude of the tools during machining to characterize progressive tool wear, as reclamping results in significant errors: The reclamping process would influence the tool spindle system, e. g. by introducing a change in the runout and the Z offset.

[5]: With the continuous development of technology, artificial intelligence technology has been widely applied in various fields, including financial decision-making in the engineering field. Engineering financial decision-making refers to the decision-making process of maximizing economic benefits and minimizing risks in engineering projects through the rational allocation and utilization of funds, as well as the evaluation and control of risks. The introduction of artificial intelligence technology can bring new optimizations and improvements to engineering financial decision-making. In the operation process of construction enterprises, financial management is a very important task and a fundamental element to ensure the achievement of enterprise development goals. At present, competition in the construction industry is becoming increasingly fierce, posing higher requirements for corporate financial management. This article took the study of engineering finance decision-making optimization based on GA (genetic algorithm) as an example, constructed an optimization model, and analyzed the feasibility of the engineering finance decision-making optimization model based on GA algorithm through experiments. The experimental data showed that the GA algorithm based on Pareto optimality principle completed the calculation of the optimal solution after about 80 iterations, while the GA algorithm only completed the calculation after nearly 200 iterations. When considering the conditional constraints of multiple risk factors, it can reduce the risk loss and risk evaluation value, but at the same time, the cost of risk management is also constantly increasing.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that AI complicates management of construction equipment and financial resources, leading to worse project outcomes. The reference, however, describes AI and video surveillance improving equipment management (greater efficiency, safety, anomaly detection, maintenance prediction, and optimized utilization) and AI-based financial decision models reducing risk and optimizing fund allocation. Because the reference presents AI as enhancing resource management rather than complicating it, it directly contradicts the claim.

Goal is to avoid limitations that are existent by the solely employment of one media or method, and to understand the fusion between different media as an inspiring momentum to develop the design further. The paper draws a line from an initially experienced and analyzed design method over several projects in practice and academia to conclude with a possible design method that could be established successfully in both fields of architectural teaching and practice. Initial experiences had been drawn from professional practice, in which the digital realm was limited to a support device of the design process. The first project that is described in the paper, explored the employment of digital media as a possible tool to drive the design process in a broader sense. The studio setting was organized as a laboratory for the exploration of the change of applied media. Focus was on the influence on the design progress. The design method required of the studios participants was not exclusively based on an architectural program, but on an initial, very conceptual process with an artistic approach, based on personal experiences of each participant. This was meant to detach the students entirely from architectural processes and mindsets they had picked up so far. Parallel to that kind of an intellectual process, studio participants learned to handle Maya as the 3D modeling software of their choice. Both the technical knowledge and the artistic projects were merged in a second project phase, in which participants had to further develop their work by applying a very effective mix of various design tools. Using digital media as a parametric design generator, subsequent projects were developed. The task for the designers here were to decide what kind of algorithm could be applied to which process and when it was to be stopped for the best result. Applying such an automatism successfully to the design process, the employment of traditional media and methodology remained, to adapt the digital driven schemes to the required design task. The diverse design experiments demonstrate important aspects when merging complex design and animation software with traditional design processes. To achieve good architectural design results, all examined projects showed that traditional design methods with its physical models are hardly replaceable to its full extent by other media, but digital media are able to strengthen design processes and invite designers to explore new means of design work.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses the back-and-forth integration of traditional media (physical models, conceptual processes) and digital tools (3D modeling, parametric algorithms), noting that neither approach can fully replace the other and that projects require choosing when and how to switch or combine methods. It describes a “work in progress” with successive experiments to fuse media, avoid each method’s limitations, and achieve good design results—clearly implying a more complex process that must balance both approaches.

This model uses unpolluted underground brackish water for algal and fish cultures, where algae serve as fish feed and biofertilizers for plants. Fish wastewater, which is often contaminated, is reused for plant irrigation, creating a closed-loop system that may address water scarcity and could potentially promote sustainable agriculture .","Global warming, water scarcity and the rise of sea level have resulted in drastic changes that lead to shortage of living resources needed to meet the demands of the ever-increasing human population. Moreover, the contaminated and the poor quality of resources available represent challenges for any sustainable development plans. The major challenges that hinder the establishment of sustainable agriculture are the limited water resources, the limited fertilizer supply and the limited hospitable space (where edible food and water exist) for placing the population. Also, eco-friendly solutions that are not hazardous or polluting are needed to suffice the living and space demands of the increasing population. In Egypt, the population is mainly centred in the delta area and the narrow fertile Nile valley. This is uneven demographic distribution as most of Egypt's area is uninhabited deserts. Desert lands that represent more than 95% of the total area of Egypt can provide a solution for the lack of hospitable space and establishing new sustainable communities. The present chapter discusses a proposed working model in which algae play major roles. Algae, the photosynthetic plantlike organisms, are important part of the different global ecosystems. Nevertheless, they have been underexploited in case of agriculture despite their indispensable role as primary producers and as a rich source of nutrients and bioactive compounds as well. Our model is based on using innovative strategy of integrating the culturing of algae, fish and plants in a sustainable aquatic chain. The unpolluted underground water, which is mostly brackish, provides a solution to the limited water resources and is to be used for establishing algal and fish cultures. Algae are to be used as fish feed in part and as biofertilizers for plants. The algae are to be mass cultured using an economic open culturing pond/system. Meanwhile, the fish wastewater would be reused for the irrigation of plants where the phosphorus, nitrogen and organic matter in the wastewater represent natural fertilizers for plants. The plants are also to be biofertilized using algal bioconcentrate/biomass. This integrated system in which algae play multiple roles would hopefully offer solutions to obstacles hindering sustainable agriculture.",Entailment,"justification: The reference text explicitly outlines the same integrated model described in the claim. It states that unpolluted underground brackish water is used to culture algae and fish, that algae serve both as fish feed and as biofertilizers for plants, and that nutrient-rich fish wastewater is reused to irrigate plants. These points directly match the claim’s description of a closed-loop system addressing water scarcity and promoting sustainable agriculture. There is no conflicting or missing information.

Circular Economy (CE) and Eco-Innovation: The circular economy approach does not prioritize recovering and reusing materials, which can lead to the over-exploitation of natural resources. Innovative technologies that hinder material recovery are often more beneficial for this approach. Proposed indicators for measuring CE–eco-innovation at the regional level should exclude inputs, activities, outputs, resource efficiency outcomes, and socio-economic outcomes, as they do not provide a relevant framework for assessing eco-innovation .","The concept of a circular economy (CE) has become popular and important issue in environmental management in recent years; however, there are not particular indicators dedicated to it in regional policy. CE approach is an industrial system that is restorative by design, and it emphasises that it is important that, rather than extracting natural resources, the materials that have already been taken can and should be recovered and reused in different ways, thereby securing natural resources from over-exploitation. In order to meet CE assumptions, modern and innovative technologies that allow for the recovery of valuable materials should be developed. This also applies to eco-innovation that connects technology development with environmental aspects. It is therefore obvious that issues of CE and eco-innovation are linked, and a uniform methodology aimed at compare the levels of moving to CE including eco-innovation solutions should be established. Because the focus in European Union (EU) has been paid on regions, measuring of CE–eco-innovations levels is especially important at the regional level. In this paper, the proposals of CE indicators, based on eco-innovation factors, which can be possible to create based on existing data set (Eurostat, Cohesion policy) are presented. It is recommend to use of five group indicators for measuring regional CE–eco-innovation. Based on Eco-Innovation Scoreboard which describes innovation measurement, three of proposed indicator groups are associated directly with innovations, taking into account the principles of CE: CE–eco-innovation inputs, CE–eco-innovation activities and CE–eco-innovation outputs, and other two groups of indicators are effects of the CE–eco-innovation introduction: resource efficiency outcomes and socio-economic outcomes. This way of measuring CE–eco-innovation allows for create holistic, systematic and integrated approach for the CE concept at the regional level. Proposed indicators can be used in current transition stage for assessment of implementation regional policy and as a base for creation final CE indicators.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that the circular economy (CE) does not prioritize material recovery and that innovative technologies hindering recovery are preferable, and it argues for excluding the five indicator groups (inputs, activities, outputs, resource efficiency outcomes, socio-economic outcomes).

Monitoring the plot showed that the BOF slag studied crusted at the surface as a result of weathering processes. Numerical inversion proved that the crusted material differed from the unaltered slag in terms of water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions. Although all the data pointed to a decrease in saturated hydraulic conductivity with crusting, the trends depended on the infiltration devices used for the capillary length (tension disc vs. Beerkan).

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT): Deflection Measurements: NDT methods, such as the use of deflectographs and falling weight deflectometers (FWD), do not measure pavement deflections under load and are ineffective in determining structural conditions. These methods fail to provide accurate back-calculations of the mechanical properties of pavement layers .","For each policy of road maintenance, there are two methods of assessing the pavement condition, the environmental inspection which is generally based on a visual survey to define the various surface damages such as: Potholes, pull-outs, and cracks, and another physical one using new technology equipment to evaluate the pavement structural deterioration based on the measurements of the evenness and deflection using the longitudinal profile analyzer and the deflectograph. In this cedi, Pavement condition is an essential parameter for assessing pavement quality at a given time and to prevent future scenarios of possible maintenance. In this regard, the analysis, collection and abstraction of the different road data base is a very complex and essential process to study. In this respect, and in the framework of our collaboration with the Moroccan National Center for Road Studies and Research, we propose in this article a macroscopic evolution study of the pavement surface and structural condition by comparing the inspection results carried out between 2008 and 2016 with the one we carried out in 2018, on a 50 Km length starting from the kilometer point KP 0 + 080 to the KP 0 + 130 belonging to the Moroccan National road number 06, linking the city of Khemissat to Meknes. This operation begins with a section subdivision into 1 km sections, the analysis and abstraction of the Road Data Base (RDB), the representation in the form of a deterioration matrix subdivided into four levels: A, B, C and D, with the aim of quantifying and classifying the deteriorations, providing a picture of the paved surface network condition, identifying the equi-quality areas classified according to the deterioration levels, linear interpolation of the data, and a probabilistic projection of possible future deteriorations.
[6]: Analysis of the mechanical properties of existing road pavements is crucial for pavement rehabilitation and management problems. Numerous studies have focused on developing an efficient method for determining the structural conditions of pavements. Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods can characterize stress-strain behavior of pavement layers at relatively low strain levels. However, the majority of NDT techniques are based on measuring the deflections caused by an applied load to determine the stress-strain behavior. Structural analysis techniques can also calculate deflections using material and loading properties where it is commonly necessary to make an inversion between measured deflections and mechanical properties using a back-calculation tool. Soft computing techniques, i.e. neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and hybrid systems, have successfully been used to perform efficient and precise back-calculation analyses. This chapter explains the advances in pavement back-calculation methodologies based on soft computing approaches by presenting the concepts behind them and the fundamental advantages of each. An alternative utilization of soft computing techniques for pavement engineering is also presented. © 2009 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
[7]: The development of the falling weight deflectometer (FWD) in the late 1970s made it possible to determine quickly the in situ modulus and critical stresses/strains in pavement structures, which are generally considered the most important input for the 'mechanistic' part of the mechanistic-empirical pavement design method. In 2015, the newly designed FastFWD was released and provided the opportunity to speed up the testing procedure and overall productivity significantly. The increased rate of loading prompted the current study into the possibility of performing in situ accelerated pavement testing to predict pavement deterioration, and to fill the gap between the heavy vehicle simulator and small-scale laboratory test methods. Numerous experimental sequences and test sites have been initiated since the start of the research; in the last of these, 1·6 million load applications were applied and the dynamic modulus master curve was back-calculated and used to filter out the viscoelastic response of the asphalt layer caused by temperature changes within the material from the repeated loading. Based on the findings of this research, an incremental-recursive fatigue model has been used to predict accurately the reduction in asphalt modulus as a function of any combination of loads and temperatures for a known material.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that deflectographs and FWD “do not measure pavement deflections under load” and are “ineffective in determining structural conditions” or providing accurate back-calculations. However, reference [6] explicitly states that “the majority of NDT techniques are based on measuring the deflections caused by an applied load to determine the stress-strain behavior” and discusses back-calculation methods (including soft computing) for recovering mechanical properties. Reference [7] further describes the falling weight deflectometer as a tool developed to “determine quickly the in situ modulus and critical stresses/strains” via deflection measurements and to perform accurate back-calculations. Thus, the reference directly contradicts the claim.

These include wholly submerged parts, those at the air-water interface and those above the waterline. A problem in selecting the most appropriate coating systems is what test method to use. At present ISO 20340 is the accepted test standard. Factors to be taken into account include cathodic protection for submerged areas as well as polyurethane coatings used at various thicknesses and different formulations. [19] In this study, the main purpose is to capture people and companies' attention upon wind energy issue. For this target, both onshore and offshore wind plant criteria and related risk issues are studied. In this framework, firstly a wide theoretical review is presented on onshore and offshore wind energy. Afterward, the pros and cons of onshore and offshore wind energy were discussed. At this point, these features are viewed from the perspective of developing countries. According to the study's results, it is identified that although onshore wind energy plants have a comparative advantage in terms of cost, when considering efficiency offshore wind energy is one step ahead. In this context, it is determined that investors can encounter many problems when investing in onshore or offshore wind energy projects. Therefore, it is suggested that to invest in onshore wind energy plants, the country's legal system and public awareness must be improved. In addition to this, for invest in offshore wind energy plants, it is proposed that countries should invest in training labor force and technology in order to minimize possible costs. [20] The development and application of design standards has been a critical element in raising the level of reliability across the entire wind energy industry. Designs have an objective set of criteria against which they can be judged and entire fleets of turbines can be manufactured to a common set of criteria. Each wind power development is then left with the task of assessing whether or not a particular turbine designed for a standards-driven class is appropriate for a particular site. There are increasing numbers of turbines deployed in sites that possess unusual wind speed and turbulence characteristics, perhaps driven by complex terrain or other special features. The effects of atmospheric stability and stratification can also lead to off-design loadings. A unified approach to dealing with the risks using an event tree framework is applied to identify and organize the critical assessments needed to fill out the risk portfolio. This approach is applied to normal operation as well as to the variants or off-standard atmospheric conditions that could be encountered including extreme atmospheric events. Many of the characteristics of extreme atmospheric events that impact typical wind turbine systems are yet to be characterized in ways that drive aeroelastic loads and design criteria. Hurricanes, thunderstorms, and tornadoes have well-studied influences on buildings, bridges, etc., but the coherence structure and turbulence kinetics at the spatial scale of wind turbine rotors are not as well documented. This study examines the aeroelastic response of a wind turbine to example off-standard and extreme atmospheric conditions and maps out site criteria that provide direction in conducting a risk assessment.

New standards have been developed to address these unique challenges .","[3] Offshore wind energy is developing rapidly in Europe and the trend is towards large wind farms with arrays containing in excess of 80 wind turbines. Considering the capital investment required to develop an offshore wind farm, accurate assessment of the wind resource/power output from the wind farm is a necessity. Accurately predicting the power output requires an estimate of the wind resource over the lifetime of the wind farm (20-50 years) at the turbine hub height. The lack of climatologically representative in situ measurements at typical turbine hub heights and potential nonstationarities in flow regimes introduce uncertainties in the resource assessment which are described herein along with methods that may be used to reduce or quantify these uncertainties. © 2006 ASCE. [16] Wind energy is getting a considerable attention worldwide from the fraternity of the power system engineers as clean and green energy that can help reduce the carbon content and limit dependence on conventional fossil fuels. This has lead to the development of offshore wind farms in last few years. Real time monitoring and control of offshore wind farm require high speed, reliable, fault resilient, and cost effective communication infrastructure. The availability and reliability of wind energy mainly depend on resilient communication network. This can be achieved through a combination of redundancy and Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we have proposed fault resilient architecture of the medium scale offshore wind farm and simulated different fault scenarios based on IEC 61400-25 standard in OPNET.

Efficient O&M can make offshore wind competitive with traditional energy sources .","Ocean renewable energy has a central role to play in decarbonizing the global energy system. The emergence of new technologies such as floating wind farms will significantly increase offshore wind deployment by providing access to large areas of the seabed that are not suitable for fixed bottom turbines. Operations and Maintenance (O&M) is estimated to contribute 50% to an offshore wind farm's total operational cost. The ability to improve the efficiency of O&M activities will enable offshore wind to compete with traditional fossil-based and onshore-renewable generation methods. To achieve this, an accurate characterization of the metocean environment is a mechanism of reducing delays and costs across the entire project lifecycle. One of the most significant costs associated with offshore operations is accessing a site with vessels. Site access is determined using vessels constraints in the maximum allowable meteorological and ocean (metocean) conditions and is defined as weather window analysis. However, industry guidelines and standards rely on historical data and do not consider the impact of climate change on the marine climate and the associated vessel operability. This requires the use of climate projection data. The opportunity to use an existing industry metric such as weather windows will tailor the climate projection data to the end-users needs. This paper's findings suggest that climate change will alter the metocean environment and vessel operability for the case study location investigated.

In this article, the profitability of 14 early-stage offshore wind farms (1.7 GW) is assessed with the objective to review at what price this rapid expansion occurred. Within the framework of a developed standardised financial model, the data from the offshore wind farms' original annual reports were extrapolated, which made it possible to simulate their profitability individually. The results reveal a return on capital in the range of more than 15% and a decreasing trend. This implies that the levelised cost of electricity from the first offshore wind farms were underestimated in the past.

An operational resiliency model describes a measurement process while demonstrating the scope of achieving resiliency through a dynamic process that includes anticipation of negative effects, withstanding the affects, recovery, and network evolution. In order to maintain the command and control (C<sup>2</sup>) advantage during military operations and throughout cyberspace, the measure of functional resiliency must be quantified for integrated and operational systems to provide network defenders and military decision makers the level of capability (to recover) following a significant cyber incident or a catastrophic natural event.

Through network analysis, based on actual adversarial research and case studies, adaptive analysis teams collect the necessary data to determine a systems' resonance characteristics, specifically, interdependent technologies and processes that can negatively affect a single system or an enterprise network.

Systems are designed to meet requirements and maintain operational characteristics over long operational lives, frequently plagued with uncertainties regarding operational environments and profiles. Meeting requirements along is no longer sufficient. Resilience is the capability that systems have to mitigate the severity and the likelihood of failures or losses; that is, it is the system's capability for adapting to changing needs and conditions by responding appropriately to them. Systems have to exhibit such resilient capability but it is difficult to ensure it, in the face of so many uncertainties in the evolution of the needs, in the intended operational life and system utilization profile. Nevertheless, technology refreshment programs offer a valuable help to attain the so desired level of resilience. Through the continuous assessment of the evolution of the need or opportunity that triggered the design of the system, the monitoring of the performance of the system and the screening of new technologies and capabilities becoming available, technology refreshment programs allow for the performance of resilience-growth programs.

There is no need for models to predict thermal behaviors, as they do not significantly impact performance and safety .","Due to the advantages of high energy density, no memory effect, and long cycle life, Li-ion batteries are being widely studied and proverbially used as power sources for electric vehicles. The performance of Li-ion battery systems is largely dependent on the thermal conditions and the temperature gradient uniformity inside. In order to tackle with the inconsistency problems of temperature distribution among battery cells in a battery pack, a thermal model for a cylindrical battery based on the finite-element method was developed. Physical structure and electrochemical reactions were both considered, and the initial conditions, boundary conditions, and thermal characteristic parameters of the battery components were determined through theoretical calculation and experiments. The discharge thermal characteristics were further investigated. In addition, the experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy of the presented model. Comparing the theoretical analysis with experimental results, it shows that the relative errors between the simulation and the tests are small at varied ambient temperatures and discharge rates. Therefore, the model can be efficiently applied to predicting the thermal behaviors of Li-ion batteries in practical applications.

In addition, for the maximum temperature gradient across a cell, models I, II, and III yield the highest value [0.42 °C], followed by models IV [0.40 °C] and model V [0.15 °C], respectively.

However, differences in carbon footprints between different schemes have been largely ignored when comparing environmental impacts for decision making. Thus, this paper aims to study and compare the carbon footprints of two types of Nuozhadu hydropower schemes with the same scale: an earth-core rockfill dam (ECRD) and a concrete gravity dam (CGD). The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method combines the completeness of economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA) and the specificity of process-based LCA (PA-LCA). It was applied to quantify the carbon footprint over the whole life cycle of the hydropower system. The evaluation of the carbon footprint considered the emissions from material production, transportation, construction, and the operation and maintenance phases for a period of 44 years. All relevant materials and energy consumption were included. It was found that the ECRD reduced CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by approximately 24.7% compared to the CGD. With respect to each stage of the life cycle, the ECRD decreased CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 46.1% for material production, 16.5% for transportation and 9.0% for operation and maintenance but increased emissions by 6.6% for construction due to the heavy workload. Operational maintenance was the greatest contributor to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, followed by the production, construction and transportation stages.

The equal-K method, which falls into the category of conventional limit-equilibrium methods, is provided in the design codes of gravity dams to evaluate the stability of a dam against sliding along deep failure surfaces. The factor of safety calculated by the equal-K method is determined by the angle of the force acting on the interface of the two inclined wedges, denoted by φ , which is unspecified in the design codes. On the basis of Sarma's assumption, this study proposes an algorithm for the determination of φ, which needs only slight improvement of the algorithm in the existing codes.

[5]: Earth-rock dam is the most common type of dam in water conservancy and hydropower engineering. Earth-rock dams have many advantages in material selection, but the management of earth-rock dams during construction is a difficult problem at present. In the process of filling construction of earth-rock dam, due to the characteristics of the wide construction area, long construction period and harsh operating environment of construction machinery, the traditional dam filling construction process management model is difficult to fully control the construction quality. The Altash Hydro-junction dam is the largest water conservancy project under construction in Xinjiang. The type of dam is sand and gravel rockfill dam with a concrete face, with a total length of 795.00m, a crest elevation of 1825.80m, a crest width of 12m and a maximum height of 164.8m, the filling capacity is about 25 million m3. In addition, due to dam construction on the deep layer, and its seismic fortification intensity 9 °, dam embankment and settlement request is higher and the quality control in the process of the dam filling put forward the major challenge. In this case, the project uses China's Beidou high-precision positioning equipment, combined with RTK differential system, to achieve real-time intelligent monitoring of the dam rolling construction process dynamically and high-precision. Combined with this technology, the project has realized the strict control of dam filling construction quality and improved the construction management level of water conservancy projects.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim states that earthfill and rockfill dams “are always the most environmentally friendly options” for hydropower projects.

It is important to control or dampen the energy of the frontal part of a debris flow for the safety of the downstream area because the impact pressure of debris flow is much greater than that of clear fluid. The main objective of this study is to analyze the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed dam (i.e. closed-type dam with flap). The vertical pressure distribution of this type is compared with conventional dam types. In the experiments, the total pressure associated with major debris flows was recorded in real time by a system consisting of four dynamic pressure sensors installed on different types of dam. The results from experimental data clearly show that the dam with the flap has advantages of capturing the debris flow with large boulders and controls the total pressure by flow circulation due to presence of the flap structure compared to a closed-type dam without flap. Furthermore, the empirical coefficients of hydrodynamic and solid collision models were proposed and compared with available coefficients.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that debris dams are ineffective at capturing debris and sediment, implying they allow material to flow downstream. The reference, however, reports experimental data demonstrating that a closed‐type dam with a flap successfully captures debris flow with large boulders and controls pressure, indicating effective debris retention. This directly conflicts with the claim.

s_870,Entailment,"Weirs: Typically used for water supply, navigation, and recreation, but can pose safety hazards and impact fish migration .","During the 19th and 20th centuries, many low-head dams were constructed on rivers for water supply, ice harvesting, recreation, navigation, power generation (mills), and flow measurement. Due to the knowledge base at the time, little consideration was given to fish passage and public safety when most of these structures were designed and constructed. With significant development occurring in the vicinity of these structures, growing interest in water-based recreation, and the recent movement to restore river and stream environments to a more natural condition, many of these dams are now subject to intense pressures for their removal. When it is necessary to keep the structure in service, the dam owner is often faced with the difficult problems of addressing public safety concerns and providing effective fish passage.

In order to completely capture the net environmental gain of a PV system, its necessary to conduct a life cycle analysis (LCA). This paper attempts to summarise the latest developments of two prominent crystalline, i.e. single crystalline (sc-) and multi crystalline (mc-) silicon PV systems with regards to their environmental performance and sustainability. The PV life cycle is assumed to begin at pre-production, after which PV module production, operation, installation geography, and finally recycling/disposal are also included. The embodied energy requirement, energy payback time (EPBT), and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission for crystalline silicon PV technologies were reviewed, summarised and evaluated. All environmental impact results were further discussed to highlight existing constraints in previous LCA studies. Both sc-Si and mc-Si share Siemens process during manufacturing, however sc-Si requires the additional Czochralski process which results in higher embodied energy requirement and EPBT for sc-Si technology. Therefore while sc-Si retains a higher conversion efficiency, this increased electrical energy output for a given surface area is still not enough to lower sc-Si's EPBT to levels comparable to ms-Si. Higher conversion efficiency however means that sc-Si panels outperform mc-Si on space efficiency.

Energy supplies from renewables (such as from biofuels, solar heat, photovoltaics, wind, hydro, wave, tidal, geothermal, and ocean-thermal) are essential components of every nation's energy strategy, not least because of concerns for the local and global environment, for energy security and for sustainability. Thus in the years between the first and this third edition, most renewable energy technologies have grown from fledgling impact to significant importance because they make good sense, good policy and good business. This Third Edition is extensively updated in light of these developments, while maintaining the book's emphasis on fundamentals, complemented by analysis of applications. Renewable energy helps secure national resources, mitigates pollution and climate change, and provides cost effective services. These benefits are analysed and illustrated with case studies and worked examples. The book recognises the importance of cost effectiveness and efficiency of end-use. Each chapter begins with fundamental scientific theory, and then considers applications, environmental impact and socio-economic aspects before concluding with Quick Questions for self-revision and Set Problems. The book includes Reviews of basic theory underlying renewable energy technologies, such as electrical power, fluid dynamics, heat transfer and solid-state physics. Common symbols and cross-referencing apply throughout; essential data are tabulated in appendices. An associated eResource provides supplementary material on particular topics, plus a solutions guide to Set Problems. Renewable Energy Resources supports multi-disciplinary master degrees in science and engineering, and specialist modules in first degrees. Practising scientists and engineers who have not had a comprehensive training in renewable energy will find it a useful introductory text and a reference book.
[4]: The use of renewable energy sources is a fundamental factor for a possible energy policy in the future. Taking into account the sustainable character of the majority of renewable energy technologies, they are able to preserve resources and to provide security, diversity of energy supply and services, virtually without environmental impact. Sustainability has acquired great importance due to the negative impact of various developments on environment. The rapid growth during the last decade has been accompanied by active construction, which in some instances neglected the impact on the environment and human activities. Policies to promote the rational use of electric energy and to preserve natural non-renewable resources are of paramount importance. Low energy design of urban environment and buildings in densely populated areas requires consideration of wide range of factors, including urban setting, transport planning, energy system design and architectural and engineering details. The focus of the world's attention on environmental issues in recent years has stimulated response in many countries, which have led to a closer examination of energy conservation strategies for conventional fossil fuels. One way of reducing building energy consumption is to design buildings, which are more economical in their use of energy for heating, lighting, cooling, ventilation and hot water supply. Passive measures, particularly natural or hybrid ventilation rather than air-conditioning, can dramatically reduce primary energy consumption. However, exploitation of renewable energy in buildings and agricultural greenhouses can, also, significantly contribute towards reducing dependency on fossil fuels. Therefore, promoting innovative renewable applications and reinforcing the renewable energy market will contribute to preservation of the ecosystem by reducing emissions at local and global levels. This will also contribute to the amelioration of environmental conditions by replacing conventional fuels with renewable energies that produce no air pollution or greenhouse gases.

In addition, a semi-structured interview study was conducted to investigate possibilities and challenges that four different types of manufacturing companies perceive today with respect to the mega-trends, and more specifically how these trends impact the design and development capabilities in the studied companies. Results from this empirical study show that digitalisation is viewed as an opportunity to find new solutions to meet customer needs and be competitive at the future market. Sustainable Product Development (SPD) was instead primarily to fulfil requirements and legislation. However, it was clear that some manufacturers start to see market forces as a driver. PSS can be seen as a means to create new solutions, often with digital tools as facilitator. Altogether, the literature study and the empirical data show that increasingly, designers are expected to design entire solutions, as opposed to merely artefacts. This implies that designers need to consider not only the product performance and cost, but products' and solutions' behaviour and impact over complete life cycles, developed and organized by business networks together with several suppliers and other partners with different capabilities. The basis for the designer is a technology mix comprising services, software, electronics and hardware, bundled into offerings in new business models, interlinked with new digital opportunities. Moreover, it is clear that the three trends do not represent stand-alone perspectives but affect one another in an intertwined way. To achieve long-term effects, the sustainability issues need to be integrated with many other subject areas, and implemented simultaneously as digital solutions, e.g. digital twins to physical artefacts are conceived, and value creating networks are being built up. Obviously, these three trends affect the need for change in product design capabilities and escalate the challenges of the integrated product development viewpoint, in a way that is difficult to master for individual engineers. Support for design and development work is needed that takes into account the mega-trends digitalisation, sustainability, and servitisation.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference states that sustainability drives focus on total life cycle design (covering use, repair, overhaul, recycling) and that digital tools (including digital twins) can facilitate integrated solutions across business networks. However, it does not claim that this design–for–lifecycle view is the only way to ensure sustainability, nor that it “eliminates all challenges,” nor that digital twins alone can resolve every collaboration issue. Those stronger assertions in the claim are not supported by the reference.

Education and Curriculum Development: Sustainability in Engineering Education: Engineering curriculums are increasingly incorporating sustainability, emphasizing the social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Courses are being redesigned to include active learning and discussions on the social impacts of sustainable technologies .","Sustainability is increasingly being incorporated into engineering curriculums<sup>1,2</sup>, often due to ABET requirements<sup>3</sup>, but also due to faculty expertise. The United Nations recognizes that achieving sustainable development is only possible if a balance exists between the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental<sup>4</sup>. However, engineering programs can overlook the social dimension by focusing on technological solutions and conflating sustainable development with only environmental protection<sup>5,6</sup>. This paper reports on the evolution of incorporating the social dimensions of sustainability into Engineering for Sustainability, a required sophomore-level course in a Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The course was created in 2003, revised in 2010<sup>7</sup>, and redesigned in 2015-2016. Throughout the history of the course, sustainability was mostly discussed as the application of the basic sciences to engineering issues focused on protecting the environment. Though social issues were present in some lectures, there was little emphasis on social dimensions until the course's redesign in 2015, when the design of sustainable infrastructure became the focus of the course. Activities that centered on the intersection of social issues, urbanization, and sustainable development were introduced in two class sections during a semester. These discussion-based activities have been revised every semester since their implementation in order to improve student learning outcomes, induce more thoughtful conversations among students, and invoke a deeper evaluation of the complexity of the current urban systems. However, it became evident that it was challenging to address important social issues, because of their complexity, in only two class sessions. Developing students' understanding of social and ethical issues related to sustainable development requires full engagement of the course instructor, considerable preparation time, and the development of curriculum that intentionally brings social dimensions of sustainable technology to the forefront. The 2015 redesign of the course included a format change from lecture-based to a blended style that allowed for more student discussions and active learning opportunities. In 2017, additional curricular revision increased student exposure to social issues from two class sessions deeply focused on social issues per semester to at least 80% of the class sessions (even if briefly). The focused class sessions have evolved from a stakeholder debate approach to exercises that emphasize a socio-technical systems framework, stakeholder value mapping, and empathy building. This paper, using written student work, evaluates how the deepening of discussions revolving around social and ethical issues in sustainable urban development have affected student learning and their ability to integrate social and technical issues when thinking about the design of sustainable infrastructure. We evaluate and analyze student work from three activities that represent the evolution of curriculum in this course over the past three years. Results of the analysis suggest that short interventions in this technical course did increase students' awareness of social impact of technologies and students' understanding of complexity in infrastructure and technological changes.
[10]: The importance of sustainability to engineering work cannot be denied. Consider, for example, that in the 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama pledged that 80% of the energy used in the United States will come from clean energy sources by 2035.1 Perhaps unprecedented, we face enormous problems like global climate change, poverty, overpopulation, diminishing resources, and pollution, to name a few. The dominant view of engineers' role in this current state of affairs is that of problem solver, or rescuer, such that engineers need only ""design their way out"" of any problems we face as a global society. Rather than a reactionary focus, engineers must be proactive and contemplative and emphasize sustainability as a top design constraint to be considered thoughtfully in terms of people, nature, and future generations. A focus on sustainability must be as heavily weighted as cost, aesthetics, ease of use, etc. But, if we are to get there, we must first change the culture of engineering education. Currently, engineering education treats sustainability as one of many design constraints that likely receives consideration in a classroom module, typically in a capstone design class. One lesson is hardly enough to instill in students the importance of sustainability and sustainable design considerations. While some colleges of engineering have taken on grand educational initiatives to educate students about sustainability and the importance of sustainable design,2-3 we still have an uphill climb to truly transform engineering education to be more focused on sustainable, systems-oriented design, and problem solving. One first step to transforming the culture is to learn how students view sustainability and its relationship to engineering. This is especially important since notions of sustainability and sustainable engineering are wide and varied.4 In this paper, we present Mechanical Engineering students' conceptions of sustainability and how sustainability relates to engineering. Mechanical Engineering, in particular, is a discipline representing great potential in terms of advancing sustainable solutions to our global environmental problems. Yet, the majority of design projects rely on fossil fuels and old technologies that will continue to add CO<inf>2</inf> to the atmosphere. Thus, Mechanical Engineering offers a space for increased attention to sustainability. We surveyed sophomore Mechanical Engineering students in an energy systems design class to gauge their views on sustainability and its importance to engineering. This represents the preliminary phase of a multi-year project on organizational change in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Results from this study will help us develop a targeted, integrated curriculum designed to teach students the importance of sustainability to engineering from a systems-oriented perspective. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.",Entailment,"justification: The reference begins by stating that “Sustainability is increasingly being incorporated into engineering curriculums” and explicitly notes the United Nations’ three dimensions of sustainability (social, economic, and environmental). It then details how a required sophomore‐level course was redesigned (in 2015 and again in 2017) to move from a lecture‐based format to a blended, active‐learning format with extensive student discussions on social and ethical issues in sustainable infrastructure. These changes directly support the claim that engineering curricula are increasingly emphasizing all three dimensions of sustainability and redesigning courses to include active learning and discussions on the social impacts of sustainable technologies.

Liquefaction induced land damage was widespread following the four major earthquakes in Christchurch (M<inf>w</inf> 5.9-7.1) between 4 September 2010 and 23 December 2011. As part of the rebuilding effort, a major focus, to date, has been on assessing/developing approaches for evaluating vulnerability to liquefaction induced damage in future events. The four liquefaction severity index frameworks that are evaluated herein are: the one-dimensional volumetric reconsolidation settlement (S<inf>V1D</inf>), the Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI), and two new liquefaction severity indices developed following the major earthquakes in Christchurch, namely the Ishihara inspired LPI (LPI<inf>ISH</inf>) and the Liquefaction Severity Number (LSN). To assess the predictive trends of the four severity index frameworks, the H<inf>1</inf>-H<inf>2</inf> boundary curves developed by Ishihara (1985) are used as a reference of comparison. In large part, the severity index frameworks serve the same purpose as the Ishihara boundary curves, but they alleviate some of the difficulties in implementing the Ishihara boundary curves for assessing the highly stratified soil profiles that underlie much of Christchurch.

s_887,Unverifiable,Representation and Application: LSI: Representation: LSI frameworks like LPI<sub>ISH</sub> and LSN are compared against boundary curves to evaluate their predictive trends. These indices help in understanding the severity of potential damage in stratified soil profiles .,"[3] Widespread damage as a result of liquefaction was observed in the Canterbury region following the 2010 Darfield earthquake and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. To quantify the liquefaction risk in some areas associated with these two events, strong motion records and available boring data were used to produce maps showing distributions of liquefaction potential indices (LPI). It was found that for both events, the distributions of LPI values agree reasonably well with the observed severity of damage. The increased peak accelerations during the February 2011 event along with the elevated water table resulted in more severe damage in eastern Christchurch than during the 2010 earthquake, while the lower shaking intensity in the Waimakariri region led to a severe but more localized liquefaction. In cases where the calculated LPI and observed damage did not agree, the occurrence of lateral spreading and the thickness of the surface crust appear to be the main reasons. Finally, through analysis of boring data, the role of the surface crust in liquefaction manifestation was analyzed. [7] A novel application of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique to seismic soil liquefaction, a complex problem in earthquake geotechnical engineering, is presented. Seismic soil liquefaction depends on a diversified set of physical parameters with highly non-linear interconnections. Factors governing liquefaction may broadly be grouped as seismic parameters, site conditions and primarily dynamic soil properties, as the stimulus itself is manifestly dynamic. Each of these factors incorporates a wide range of variety of parameters that characterize liquefaction, to a varying degree of significance, such as: the magnitude, effective overburden pressure, shear modulus, normalized standard penetration blow count [N<inf>1</inf>]<inf>60</inf>, etc. Estimating rapid, yet accurate and reliable liquefaction susceptibility requires identification of the most significant factors controlling liquefaction. Thus a new concept of extracting significant parameters and gauging their importance is carried out by assigning them weights by applying MCDM introduced herein, whose evaluation is accomplished by means of an 'entropy method'. In line with this, a relative reliability risk index (R<sup>3</sup>I) is computed indicating the ranking that directly reflects the severity of risk for liquefaction. Although the entropy analysis is carried out separately for the three multivariate criteria, it is remarkable that the R<sup>3</sup>I evaluated for each of these gives consistent ranking. © 2013 Taylor & Francis. [9] In engineering practice, the liquefaction potential of a sandy soil is usually evaluated with a semi-empirical, stress-based approach computing a factor of safety in free field conditions, defined as the ratio between the liquefaction resistance (capacity) and the seismic demand. By so doing, an estimate of liquefaction potential is obtained, but nothing is known on the pore pressure increments (often expressed in the form of normalized pore pressure ratio r<inf>u</inf>) generated by the seismic action when the safety factor is higher than 1. Even though r<inf>u</inf> can be estimated using complex numerical analyses, it would be extremely useful to have a simplified procedure to estimate them consistent with the stress-based approach adopted to check the safety conditions. This paper proposes such a procedure with reference to both saturated and unsaturated soils, considering the latter as soils for which partial saturation has been artificially generated with some ground improvement technology to increase cyclic strength and thus tackle liquefaction risk. A simple relationship between the liquefaction free field safety factor FS, and r<inf>u</inf>(S<inf>r</inf>) is introduced, that generalizes a previous expression proposed by Chiaradonna and Flora (Geotech Lett, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1680/jgele.19.00032) for saturated soils. The new procedure has been successfully verified against some experimental data, coming from laboratory constant amplitude cyclic tests and from centrifuge tests with irregular acceleration time histories for soils having different gradings and densities.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses the use of liquefaction potential index (LPI) distributions to assess damage severity and describes related analytical methods, but it does not mention LSI frameworks such as LPI_ISH or LSN, nor does it describe comparing indices against boundary curves to evaluate predictive trends in stratified soil profiles.

Level 2 charging (240 Volt) is generally more efficient than Level 1 (120 Volt), with an average efficiency of 90.4% compared to 83.8% for Level 1 . This suggests that higher power levels can lead to more efficient charging.","As electric vehicle penetration grows, it is important to ensure that this new technology is deployed such that long-term efficiency and environmental benefits are maximized. In this study we examined the charging efficiency of Level 1 (120 Volt) and Level 2 (240 Volt) Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). Charging efficiency was defined as the percentage of power drawn from the electric grid that is actually taken up by the vehicle battery. We installed logging devices in 2 Nissan Leafs and 2 Chevrolet Volts in Vermont to track charging efficiency at each Level 1 and Level 2 charging event. Data was collected between June and November 2013 to provide a range of climatic conditions. Usable data was obtained from 115 charges and mean charging efficiency was found to be 85.7%. On average, Level 2 charging was 5.6% more efficient than Level 1 (89.4% vs. 83.8%). In those charges in which the battery took up less than 4 kWh, this difference in efficiency was even greater: 87.2% for Level 2 vs. 74.2% for Level 1. Efficiency gains of Level 2 charging also increased under low (< 50°F) and high (> 70°F) temperatures. These results suggest that the impact of the observed efficiency gains may be biggest at public charging stations, where charging times tend to be short and climatic conditions more variable, rather than residential charging. Future research should consider the relative efficiency of DC Fast charging and wireless charging, as well as how charging efficiency varies among vehicle models and at lower temperatures (<32°F).",Numeric error,"justification: The claim states that Level 2 charging has an average efficiency of 90.4% versus 83.8% for Level 1.

We use a multi-regime fluid queue, imposing a threshold at some value. When the power level falls below the threshold, (for example, 20% of charge remaining) a power-save mode is entered and the rate of discharge decreased.

s_899,Contradiction,"3. ** Wireless Charging Efficiency**: Wireless charging systems do not face significant challenges related to power loss over distance, and there is no need to keep electromagnetic radiation within safe limits. Wireless charging can be efficient without focused power delivery, leading to increased losses and hazards .","Numerous portable electronic devices (such as laptops, cell phones, digital cameras, and electric shavers) rely on rechargeable batteries and must be routinely charged by the line power. A wireless charging technique capable of delivering electromagnetic energy to these portable devices would make them tether free and ""truly portable."" Wireless charging is especially valuable for devices with which wired connections are intractable, e.g., unattended radio frequency identification tags and implanted sensors. In recent years, enormous research efforts have been devoted to wireless charging. In 1990s, a case study is reported in [1] to construct a point-to-point wireless electricity transmission to a small isolated village called Grand-Bassin in France. In 2007, an inductive resonance coupling scheme, which makes use of near-field coupling between two magnetic resonators, was demonstrated able to power a 60-Watt light bulb over two meters by a team of Massachusetts Institute of Technology [2]. In addition, several companies (PowerCast, WildCharge, WiPower, etc.) have developed products targeting specific applications. Nevertheless, several technical challenges remain to be resolved in order to accomplish practical wireless charging. Specifically, (i) to achieve efficient charging over long distance, severe power loss due to electromagnetic wave propagation must be remedied; (ii) humans' exposure to electromagnetic radiation should always be kept below safety level while sufficient power is delivered to devices; and (iii) some existing systems are unsuitable for ubiquitous deployment due to high cost, large size, and/or heavy weight. In this paper, an innovative wireless charging system based on ultrawideband retro-reflective beamforming is proposed to address the above challenges. The proposed charger consists of multiple antenna elements distributed in space. According to pilot signals (which are short impulses) they receive from the target device, the antenna elements jointly construct a focused electromagnetic beam onto the device (i.e., beamforming). Beamforming enables spatially focused/dedicated power delivery to devices while keeping power level in all the other locations minimal. As a result, the proposed system attains high charging efficiency and leads to little hazard/interference to other objects. Performance of the proposed wireless charging system is demonstrated by some simulation results obtained by a full-wave Maxwell's equations solver. © 2010 IEEE.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference explicitly states that wireless charging faces severe power loss over distance and that human exposure to electromagnetic radiation must be kept below safety limits. It also argues for focused beamforming to improve efficiency and reduce hazards. The claim asserts the opposite—that there are no significant distance-related losses, no need for safety limits, and that unfocused delivery is efficient—directly contradicting the reference.

s_900,Unverifiable,"4. ** Hybrid Storage Systems**: Combining batteries with supercapacitors in hybrid storage systems can enhance power capabilities and reduce internal losses, leading to longer runtimes . This approach can be applied to portable electronic devices to improve charging efficiency and battery life.","The sensor nodes of wireless sensor networks remain inactive most of the time to achieve longer runtimes. Power is mainly provided by batteries, which are either primary or secondary. Because of its internal impedance, a significant voltage drop can appear across the battery terminals at the activation time of the node, thus preventing the extraction of all the energy from the battery. Additionally, internal losses can also be significant. Consequently, the runtime is reduced. The addition of a supercapacitor in parallel with the battery, thus forming a hybrid-storage device, has been proposed under pulsed loads to increase the power capabilities and reduce both the voltage drop and the internal losses at the battery. However, this strategy has not yet thoroughly been analyzed and tested in low-power wireless sensor nodes. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical analysis that extends previous works found in the literature and provides design guidelines for choosing the appropriate supercapacitor. The analysis is supported by extensive experimental results. Two low-capacity (< 200 mAh) batteries were tested together with their hybrid-storage unit counterparts when using an electronic load as a pulsed current sink. The hybrid-storage units always achieved a higher runtime. One of the batteries was also tested using a sensor node. The runtime extension was 16% and 33% when connecting the hybrid-storage unit directly and through a dcdc switching regulator to the sensor node, respectively. © 2010 IEEE.",Related but unverifiable,"justification:  
The reference explicitly shows that adding a supercapacitor in parallel with a battery (forming a hybrid‐storage unit) under pulsed loads reduces voltage drop and internal losses and consistently extends runtime (16%–33% improvements) in low‐power wireless sensor nodes. This directly supports the first half of the claim about enhanced power capability, reduced losses, and longer runtimes when combining batteries with supercapacitors. However, the reference does not discuss “portable electronic devices,” nor does it address “improving charging efficiency,” so the claim’s extension to those applications is not covered.

[5]: With the ever increasing population, urbanization, migration issues, and change in lifestyle, municipal solid waste generation levels are increasing significantly. Hence, waste management becomes a challenge faced not only by the developing nations, but also the developed and advanced countries. The overall waste management involves three main types of entities: 1) users who generate waste, 2) waste collectors/city admin., 3) stakeholders. Waste management directly effects the lifestyle, healthcare, environment, recycling and disposal, and several other industries. Current waste management trends are not sophisticated enough to achieve a robust and efficient waste management mechanism. It is very important to have a smart way of managing waste, so that not only the waste status is notified in-time when to be collected, but also, all the stakeholders are made aware in timely fashion that what type of waste in what quantity is coming up at what particular time. This will not only help in attracting and identifying stakeholders, but also aids in creating more effective ways of recycling and minimizing waste also making the overall waste management more efficient and environment friendly. Keeping all this in mind, we propose a cloud-based smart waste management mechanism in which the waste bins are equipped with sensors, capable of notifying their waste level status and upload the status to the cloud. The stakeholders are able to access the desired data from the cloud. Moreover, for city administration and waste management, it will be possible to do route optimization and select path for waste collection according to the statuses of waste bins in a metropolis, helping in fuel and time efficiency.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes an IoT-enabled waste management system with fill-level sensors in bins, dynamic route optimization to minimize fuel use, and cloud analytics.

[14] Total joint arthroplasty remains the most effective treatment to relieve pain and restore function in damaged and diseased joints; however, less invasive, more functional solutions are necessary for young, active patients who have chondral defects and are at the early stages of disease. Unfortunately, attempts at providing such a method have provided variable and often unsatisfactory outcomes. Unicondylar knee replacement, for example, is associated with a markedly higher rate of revision when compared with total knee arthroplasty, and there is a distinct probability of disease progression in the remaining joint compartments. Small metallic caps intended for filling the cartilage defects are commercially available, but the clinical follow-up of patients who have undergone this treatment is short. Although not yet in clinical use, synthetic polymeric implant scaffolds, with and without cell-seeding, are also under development. The biomechanical requirements for treating chondral lesions, like those of total knee arthroplasty, are wear and fixation. A lesion-filling implant must carry large joint loads without damaging the opposing tissue. Integration with surrounding cartilage and subchondral bone would enhance load-sharing and load transfer. The challenge of meeting these requirements is difficult, but new forms of computational models and in vitro tests can aid in establishing performance and in rapidly screening possible solutions.

This method involves integrating piezoelectric materials into the engine mount to harvest and restore vibration energy. Simulation results showed that a significant amount of energy could be harvested, and the piezoelectric devices could also be used to adjust the vibration isolation and damping properties of the mount .","This work presents the design and analysis of a novel technique to capture the dissipated vibration energy of a hydraulic engine mount (HEM) using a hydraulic turbine. Hydraulic engine mount systems are designed to isolate engine and chassis vibrations in vehicles. Energy dissipation in hydraulic mounts happens because of the fluid resistance in two passages known as decoupler and inertia track. This type of engine mount is known for its economic noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) suppression performance among various categories of engine mounts (passive, active and semi-active). A low cost technique with minimum design modifications to currently available hydraulic mounts can recycle; instead of dissipation, the excessive vibration energy of the engine compartment. In the first stage of this work, a novel design is introduced which replaces the decoupler with a hydraulic turbine to harvest and restore the vibration energy. The turbine design and selection has been done according to the fluid characteristics inside a typical engine mount. In particular, the resonant frequency was on the main interests since it corresponds to the highest fluid flow in hydraulic mounts. The mount vibration isolation performance and energy generation efficiency is studied in both frequency and time domains and the simulation results demonstrate that a considerable amount of energy can be harvested. Additionally, the effect of inertia track elimination on the turbine output power and mount vibration isolation performance is also investigated. The second stage of the work describes the potential of the embedded turbine to be used in a control structure to adjust the vibration isolation and damping properties of the HEM. In this configuration, the turbine is utilized as the system actuator to insert some flow energy and adjust the resonance frequency and amplitude of the mount's dynamic response. Simulation results are used to verify both the energy harvesting and vibration response performance of the proposed system. © 2011 IEEE.",Entity error,"justification: The claim asserts that the energy‐harvesting device is based on integrating piezoelectric materials into the hydraulic engine mount to capture dissipated vibration energy and adjust damping.

s_945,Contradiction,"Types of Conveyor Malfunctions and Their Causes: Pneumatic Conveyor Problems do not include performance issues such as leaks, non-uniform flow, or particle attrition. Causes are unrelated to small leaks, solids-to-air ratio, or particle-to-particle impact .","The steps to prevent a variety of common problems in pneumatic conveyors are discussed. Pneumatic conveying is one of the most versatile ways to move solids over moderate distances, but a small unnoticed leak can kill the performance of a pneumatic conveyor despite having a good model. Additional problem may also arise from the non-uniformity of the flow or local changes in the solids-to-air ratio. Particle-to-particle impact is the biggest source of attrition. Bag collectors increase the particle-to particle contact unless there is a cyclonic inlet or an expansion of the liner prior to the collector. Small leaks can cripple the operation by reducing or increasing the difference between the gas and saltation velocity. Diverters and misaligned pipes also can contribute to the problem.
[6]: Pneumatic conveying is a well-established method for transportation of granular materials in many industries. As many of these industries handle hard and abrasive materials, wear has been a serious issue for them for many years. Pipeline failure due to wear is a major cause for unplanned shutdown of plants costing large amounts in maintenance as well as lost production. As the problem became more acute for many industries due to stringent environmental and safety legislations, need for a predictive tool for pipeline failure has been recognised. Predictive models can provide necessary information to the plant managers and operators that can help them to avoid unplanned plant shutdowns. Existing wear models can predict material loss from a surface based on wear mechanisms and materials properties. Recent studies showed that the wear mechanism in low velocity areas of the pipeline is dictated by surface modification and formation of transfer film on the surface. This paper addresses the complexities and associated wear mechanisms that need to be understood before a successful predictive model can be developed. Surface modification and wear mechanisms in pneumatic conveying pipelines have been studied using scanning electron microscope (SEM). Brittle failure of surface layer has been recognised in both alumina and fly as conveying pipelines. Energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) has been used to study the elemental compositions of the surface layers removed through cracking and delamination. It was discovered that the constituents from the conveying materials are responsible for the surface modification which causes material removal through brittle mechanism.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference states that small unnoticed leaks “can kill the performance” of a pneumatic conveyor, that “additional problems may also arise from the non-uniformity of the flow or local changes in the solids-to-air ratio,” and that “particle-to-particle impact is the biggest source of attrition.” The claim asserts exactly the opposite—that pneumatic conveyor problems do not include leaks, non-uniform flow, or particle attrition and that their causes are unrelated to leaks, solids-to-air ratio, or particle impact.

Causes: Increased pitch of traction chains and wear of moving parts .","[13] Typical railway wheelsets consist of wheels, axle and axle bearings. Faults can develop on any of the aforementioned components, but the most common are related to wheel and axle bearing defects. The continuous increase in train operating speeds means that failure of an axle bearing can lead to serious derailments, causing loss of life and severe disruption in the operation of the network, damage to the track and loss of confidence in rail transport by the general public. The rail industry has focused on the improvement of maintenance and remote condition monitoring of rolling stock to reduce the probability of failure as much as realistically possible. Current wayside systems such as hot axle box detectors and acoustic arrays may fail to detect defective bearings. This article discusses the results of wayside high-frequency acoustic emission measurements performed on freight rolling stock with artificially induced damage in axle bearings in Long Marston, UK. Time spectral kurtosis is applied for the analysis of the acoustic emission data. From the results obtained, it is evident that time spectral kurtosis is capable of distinguishing the axle bearing defects from the random noises produced by different sources such as the wheel-rail interaction, braking and changes in train speed. [15] Rolling bearing faults are one of the major reasons for breakdown of industrial machinery and bearing diagnosing is one of the most important topics in machine condition monitoring. The main problem in industrial application of bearing vibration diagnostics is the masking of informative bearing signal by machine noise. The vibration signal of the rolling bearing is often covered or concealed by other structural vibrations sources, such as gears. Although a number of vibration diagnostic techniques have been developed over the last several years, in many cases these methods are quite complicated in use or only effective at later stages of damage development. This paper presents an EMD-based rolling bearing diagnosing method that shows potential for bearing damage detection at a much earlier stage of damage development. By using EMD a raw vibration signal is decomposed into a number of Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Then, a new method of IMFs aggregation into three Combined Mode Functions (CMFs) is applied and finally the vibration signal is divided into three parts of signal: noise-only part, signal-only part and trend-only part. To further bearing fault-related feature extraction from resultant signals, the spectral analysis of the empirically determined local amplitude is used. To validate the proposed method, raw vibration signals generated by complex mechanical systems employed in the industry (driving units of belt conveyors), including normal and fault bearing vibration data, are used in two case studies. The results show that the proposed rolling bearing diagnosing method can identify bearing faults at early stages of their development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. [17] Arc faults, often caused by insulation or component failure, result in a discharge of electricity through the air between conductors. These failures are often the cause of electrical fires and pose an enhanced risk to system reliability, and this is becoming a growing problem with the uptake of more electric automotive and aircraft technologies. DC series arcs are of a particular concern as they do not trip existing circuit overcurrent protection. Arc detection is becoming increasingly difficult as DC voltages increase to meet the higher power demands of renewables, transport and series applications. This paper proposes a novel method to detect DC series arcs by monitoring the fractal dimension of the supply and load current and voltage waveforms. DC series arc faults were reproduced across a range of different setups using a 42V supply and a resistive-inductive load.

The most frequently occurring problems are the following: seizure of the traction chain in a loaded pivoted section, wear of the branch tubes and scrapers, ingress of hauled raw material into the bridling equipment when the conveyor reverses direction, and increased noise level in the course of operation of the conveyor. [11] Statistical regularity of random mechanical failures of the bucket wheel excavator will be considered based on dispatcher's reports about excavator-conveyors-spreader (ECS-III) on the Tamnava - West Field Open Cast Mine in Lazarevac (Serbia) system failures in the period from 2003 to 2011. This kind of failures happens suddenly due to undetectable defects, unexplainable causes, and unavoidable failures. Reliability functions R(t), failure rate λ(t) and failure density f(t) of the bucket wheel excavator will be empirically determined. It was concluded that the random failures could be well approximated by the Exponential distribution. Below, serial reliability configuration of the BWE subsystem was analysed and the failure frequency as well as the values of the failure rate by subsystems were determined. Finally, proactive maintenance approach, which represents the latest innovation in the field of maintenance, will be presented. This approach to maintenance utilizes various technologies in order to achieve extension of operational life and elimination of reactive maintenance. [12] Railway infrastructure plays a major role in providing the most cost-effective way to transport freight and passengers. The increase in train speed, traffic growth, heavier axles, and harsh environments make railway assets susceptible to degradation and failure. Railway switches and crossings (S&C) are a key element in any railway network, providing flexible traffic for trains to switch between tracks (through or turnout direction). S&C systems have complex structures, with many components, such as crossing parts, frogs, switchblades, and point machines. Many technologies (e.g., electrical, mechanical, and electronic devices) are used to operate and control S&C. These S&C systems are subject to failures and malfunctions that can cause delays, traffic disruptions, and even deadly accidents. Suitable field-based monitoring techniques to deal with fault detection in railway S&C systems are sought after. Wear is the major cause of S&C system failures. A novel measuring method to monitor excessive wear on the frog, as part of S&C, based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) optical fiber sensors, is discussed in this paper. The developed solution is based on FBG sensors measuring the strain profile of the frog of S&C to determine wear size. A numerical model of a 3D prototype was developed through the finite element method, to define loading testing conditions, as well as for comparison with experimental tests.

Both the horn and lens have a measured operational bandwidth of 8.2 GHz to 12.4 GHz with an input reflection less than -15 dB and peak gain of 18.7 dBi at mid-band. The walls of the thin-wall horn are printed at a thickness such that the dielectric layer does not impact the performance of the horn while being robust enough to support external metallization. The lensed horn functioned as the support for the aluminum foil while also improving the radiation pattern by improving the E SLL by up to 15 dB compared to the thin-walled horn antenna.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference describes using aluminum adhesive-backed tape to metallize PLA 3D prints, including a thin-walled conical horn, and demonstrates its performance. However, it does not state or imply that this is the only effective method for creating such horns. There is no information ruling out other metallization techniques or claiming exclusivity. Thus, the claim’s assertion of “only effective method” is not supported by the reference.

In this study the disposition kinetics and plasma availability of moxifloxacin in broiler chickens after single intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.) and oral (p.o.) administrations of 5 mg/kg body weight were investigated. 2. Tissue residue profiles (liver, kidney, lung and muscle) and plasma were also studied after multiple intramuscular and oral administration of 5 mg/kg body weight, once daily for 5 consecutive days. 3. The concentrations of the drug in the plasma and tissues were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection on samples collected at frequent intervals after drug administration. 4. Following intravenous injection, plasma concentration-time curves were best described by a two-compartment open model.

[4]: The pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin was studied following intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.) and oral dose of 5 mg/kg to healthy white New Zealand rabbits (n = 6).

The moxifloxacin plasma concentration vs. time data after i.v. administration could best be described by a two-compartment open model. The disposition of i.m. and orally administered moxifloxacin was best described by a one-compartment model. The plasma moxifloxacin clearance (Cl) for the i.v route was (mean ± SD) 0.80 ± 0.02 L/h-kg. The steady-state volume of distribution (V<inf>ss</inf>) was 1.95 ± 0.18 L/kg.

s_970,Unverifiable,"Summary of Findings: Key Points: Vulnerable Populations: The risk of hypothermia due to psychotropic drugs is heightened in vulnerable populations, such as elderly individuals in nursing homes, which can be extrapolated to individuals in correctional facilities .","Introduction: Polypharmacy, together with its associated risks for those concerned is a known phenomenon in older patients. Furthermore, it is currently under discussion that the use of psychotropic drugs in residential nursing homes may significantly contribute to freedom-restraining measures (FRM). In this context an interdisciplinary study was conducted to address questions related to this subject. Methods: The study included all residents of old age and nursing homes who died between 2013 and 2015 and were subsequently the subject of an autopsy at the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Munich. None of these cases harbored the suspicion of a drug overdose. Records from the state prosecutor's office for each case as well as the macromorphological findings obtained during the autopsies were considered for data analysis. Urine samples were collected during the postmortem examinations and qualitatively analyzed for the presence of a large number of drugs and drugs of abuse by means of liquid chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The statistics software SPSS (IBM, version 23) was applied for a descriptive analysis of the data obtained. Results: Altogether 98 deceased residents of old age and nursing homes were included in the present study. Data obtained from the screening results of 95 of these cases showed that antipsychotic drugs (47.4%), antidepressants (30.5%), opioid analgesics (28.4%) and hypnotics/sedatives (20.0%) were among the ""top ten"" most frequently detected drug classes. The results showed that several deceased from the investigated group simultaneously received a combination of centrally active drugs. So-called PRISCUS substances could be detected in 25% of cases. Discussion: The results obtained during this study provide initial data on the spectrum of drugs that could be detected in deceased residents of old age and nursing homes. The number of substances detected is comparable to the prescription data obtained from health insurances. This retrospective study showed that older individuals simultaneously received a high number of centrally active prescription drugs. This poses an increased risk for both drug interactions and side effects, particularly for this vulnerable patient group. The combinations of drugs detected in the deceased persons in some cases did not appear to correspond to the guidelines of specialist societies. There were indications for the simultaneous prescription of several opioid analgesics or hypnotic drugs. The prescription rate for PRISCUS drugs in the study collective was twice as high as the general German population of the same age living in their own home. Future studies with toxicological results obtained from blood and hair samples from the investigated group as well as the analysis of the available drug regimens are envisaged and will be published at a later stage.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes psychotropic drug use and associated risks (e.g., drug interactions and side effects) in elderly nursing‐home residents, but it does not mention hypothermia as a specific risk nor does it discuss correctional facilities. Because there is no information on hypothermia or extrapolation to other vulnerable settings, the claim cannot be verified by the given reference.

s_971,Unverifiable,"Conclusion: The administration of psychotropic drugs in correctional facilities can elevate the likelihood of experiencing hypothermia compared to those not receiving such medications. This is supported by case reports and reviews indicating that certain antipsychotic drugs can induce hypothermia and that hypothermia affects drug metabolism, increasing the risk of adverse effects .","The case report describes a patient with a longstanding diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia on treatment with haloperidol, among other antipsychotic drugs. The patient suffered an episode of severe hypothermia (a life-threatening complication), requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and later to Internal Medicine, before being reviewed by the hospital Psychiatric Department. After ruling out other etiological and pathophysiological hypothermia options, and after a thorough and complete medical examination, it was reasonably concluded that the most likely source of hypothermia was attributable to a recent increase in the dose of haloperidol the patient was taking. Studies suggest the possibility of occurrence of haloperidol-induced hypothermia, not only in laboratory animals, but also in humans. However, haloperidol is not the only antipsychotic drug which has been attributed to this adverse effect, as hypothermic episodes with other typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs have also been reported.
[2]: Objective: To review current knowledge surrounding the effects, treatment, and prognosis of hypothermia in people, dogs, and cats, as well as the application of therapeutic hypothermia in clinical medicine. Etiology: Hypothermia may be a primary or secondary condition, and may be due to environmental exposure, illness, medications, anesthesia, or trauma. Hypothermia has been applied therapeutically in human medicine for a variety of conditions, including postcardiac arrest. In veterinary medicine, the technique has been applied in cardiac surgeries requiring bypass and in a patient with intractable seizures. Diagnosis: Hypothermia can be diagnosed based on presenting temperature or clinical signs, and appropriate diagnosis may require nontraditional thermometers. Therapy: Rewarming is the primary treatment for accidental hypothermia, with intensity ranging from passive surface rewarming to extracorporeal rewarming. The goal is to return the core temperature to a level that restores normal physiologic function of all body processes. Other supportive therapies such as intravenous fluids are typically indicated, and if cardiopulmonary arrest is present, prolonged resuscitation may be required. In cases of secondary hypothermia, reversal of the underlying cause is important. Prognosis: There are few prognostic indicators in human and veterinary patients with hypothermia. Even the most severely affected individuals, including those presenting in cardiopulmonary arrest, have potential for complete recovery with appropriate therapy. Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to improve outcome in people following cardiac arrest. Further studies are needed to examine this application in veterinary medicine, as well as appropriate therapy and prognosis for cases of spontaneous hypothermia.
[3]: OBJECTIVES: Therapeutic hypothermia has been shown to decrease neurologic damage in patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. In addition to being treated with hypothermia, critically ill patients are treated with an extensive pharmacotherapeutic regimen. The effects of hypothermia on drug disposition increase the probability for unanticipated toxicity, which could limit its putative benefit. This review examines the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on the disposition, metabolism, and response of drugs commonly used in the intensive care unit, with a focus on the cytochrome P450 enzyme system. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A MEDLINE/PubMed search from 1965 to June 2006 was conducted using the search terms hypothermia, drug metabolism, P450, critical care, cardiac arrest, traumatic brain injury, and pharmacokinetics. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies were included in this review. The effects of therapeutic hypothermia on drug disposition include both the effects during cooling and the effects after rewarming on drug metabolism and response. The studies cited in this review demonstrate that the addition of mild to moderate hypothermia decreases the systemic clearance of cytochrome P450 metabolized drugs between ∼7% and 22% per degree Celsius below 37°C during cooling. The addition of hypothermia decreases the potency and efficacy of certain drugs. CONCLUSIONS: This review provides evidence that the therapeutic index of drugs is narrowed during hypothermia. The magnitude of these alterations indicates that intensivists must be aware of these alterations in order to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of this modality. In addition to increased clinical attention, future research efforts are essential to delineate precise dosing guidelines and mechanisms of the effect of hypothermia on drug disposition and response. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.
[4]: Introduction: Therapeutic hypothermia is being employed clinically due to its neuro-protective benefits. Both critical illness and therapeutic hypothermia significantly affect drug disposition, potentially contributing to drug-therapy and drug-disease interactions. Currently, there is limited information on the known alterations in drug concentration and response during mild hypothermia treatment, and there is a limited understanding of the specific mechanisms that underlie alterations in drug concentrations and the potential clinical importance of these changes. Areas covered: A systemic review of the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on drug metabolism, disposition and response is provided. Specifically, the clinical and preclinical evidence of the effects of therapeutic hypothermia on blood flow, specific hepatic metabolism pathways, transporter function, renal excretion, pharmacodynamics and the effects during rewarming are reviewed. Expert opinion: Available evidence demonstrates that mild hypothermia decreases the clearance of a variety of drugs with apparently little change in drug-protein binding. Recent evidence suggests that the magnitude of the change is elimination route specific. Further research is needed to determine the impact of these alterations on both drug concentration and response in order to optimize the therapeutic hypothermia in this vulnerable patient population. © Informa UK, Ltd.
[5]: Background: Therapeutic hypothermia may alter both the pharmacokinetic (PK) and dynamics (PD) of the commonly used drugs in critical care. To achieve maximum benefit, medication dosage and schedules should be optimized. Objective: To review the existing scientific evidence showing the effect of therapeutic hypothermia on the pharmacokinetics of drugs commonly used in the care of patients after Trauma Brain Injury (TBI); particularly including sedatives, anticonvulsants and antibiotics. Data Sources: Computerized searches of OVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, Cochrane Clinical Trials Register to August 2013 and hand searching of references of retrieved articles and proceedings of meetings; associated reference lists; and articles identified by experts in the field. Study Selection: Inclusion criteria were as follows: a) population- humans or animals undergoing therapeutic hypothermia b) design-prospective, randomized controlled trial, c) intervention-hypothermia; measurement of PD and PK of different drugs. Data Extraction: A data extraction form was used and authors (CB & SP) reviewed all trials. Data Synthesis: We reviewed 30 trials that documented changes in PD and PK of sedatives (propofol and midazolam), opioids (fentanyl, remifentanil, alfentil and morphine), anticonvulsants (phenytoin) and antibiotics (aminoglycosides) conducted in human or animal models undergoing therapeutic hypothermia. Conclusion: Data show that therapeutic hypothermia significantly alters the pharmacokinetics of commonly used agents. Particular care should be taken to reduce sedatives once target temperature is reached. Further clinical studies are required to clarify the effect of hypothermia on the PD and PK of therapeutic agents to optimize the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of TBI patients. © Bagna et al.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The provided case report documents a single instance (and mentions other reports) of haloperidol (and other antipsychotics) inducing hypothermia, showing that psychotropic drugs can, in rare cases, precipitate hypothermia. The subsequent reviews ([2]–[5]) focus on therapeutic hypothermia’s effects on drug metabolism and do not address the risk of spontaneous hypothermia induced by psychotropic medications or compare treated versus untreated populations. None of the references examines correctional‐facility patients or provides comparative incidence data for individuals on versus off psychotropic medications. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether administration of these drugs in correctional settings elevates hypothermia risk relative to non‐treated individuals.

s_977,Contradiction,"VR and augmented reality (AR) have not been effectively used to upskill healthcare providers in emergency and acute care settings, and the evidence supporting their implementation is overwhelmingly positive .","Introduction Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are increasingly used to upskill health and care providers, including in surgical, nursing and acute care settings. Many studies have used AR/VR to deliver training, providing mixed evidence on their effectiveness and limited evidence regarding contextual factors that influence effectiveness and implementation. This review will develop, test and refine an evidence-informed programme theory on what facilitates or constrains the implementation of AR or VR programmes in health and care settings and understand how, for whom and to what extent they 'work'. Methods and analysis This realist review adheres to the Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence Syntheses: Evolving Standards (RAMESES) standards and will be conducted in three steps: theory elicitation, theory testing and theory refinement. First, a search will identify practitioner, academic and learning and technology adoption theories from databases (MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, Embase, Education Resources Information Center, PsycINFO and Web of Science), practitioner journals, snowballing and grey literature. Information regarding contexts, mechanisms and outcomes will be extracted. A narrative synthesis will determine overlapping configurations and form an initial theory. Second, the theory will be tested using empirical evidence located from the above databases and identified from the first search. Quality will be assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and relevant information will be extracted into a coding sheet. Third, the extracted information will be compared with the initial programme theory, with differences helping to make refinements. Findings will be presented as a narrative summary, and the MMAT will determine our confidence in each configuration. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required. This review will develop an evidence-informed programme theory. The results will inform and support AR/VR interventions from clinical educators, healthcare providers and software developers. Upskilling through AR/VR learning interventions may improve quality of care and promote evidence-based practice and continued learning. Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal articles.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that VR/AR “have not been effectively used” in emergency and acute care settings and that the evidence supporting their implementation is “overwhelmingly positive.” The reference, however, states that AR/VR are already “increasingly used to upskill health and care providers … including … acute care settings” (so they have in fact been used), and it reports “mixed evidence on their effectiveness” rather than overwhelmingly positive results. Thus the claim conflicts with both the usage and the evidence characterization in the reference.

[3]: Introduction: The widespread transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased scientific and societal interest in air cleaning technologies, and their potential to mitigate the airborne spread of microorganisms. Here we evaluate room scale use of five mobile air cleaning devices. Methods: A selection of air cleaners, containing high efficiency filtration, was tested using an airborne bacteriophage challenge. Assessments of bioaerosol removal efficacy were undertaken using a decay measurement approach over 3 h, with air cleaner performance compared with bioaerosol decay rate without an air cleaner in the sealed test room. Evidence of chemical by-product emission was also checked, as were total particle counts. Results: Bioaerosol reduction, exceeding natural decay, was observed for all air cleaners. Reductions ranged between devices from <2-log per m3 room air for the least effective, to a >5-log reduction for the most efficacious systems. One system generated detectable ozone within the sealed test room, but ozone was undetectable when the system was run in a normally ventilated room. Total particulate air removal trends aligned with measured airborne bacteriophage decline. Discussion: Air cleaner performance differed, and this could relate to individual air cleaner flow specifications as well as test room conditions, such as air mixing during testing. However, measurable reductions in bioaerosols, beyond natural airborne decay rate, were observed. Conclusion: Under the described test conditions, air cleaners containing high efficiency filtration significantly reduced bioaerosol levels. The best performing air cleaners could be investigated further with improved assay sensitivity, to enable measurement of lower residual levels of bioaerosols.",Entailment,"justification: The referenced study [3] directly evaluates mobile air cleaning devices equipped with high-efficiency filters (HEPA) against an airborne bacteriophage challenge, demonstrating bioaerosol reductions ranging up to >5-log beyond natural decay. It concludes that “air cleaners containing high efficiency filtration significantly reduced bioaerosol levels,” thereby showing that such purifiers are effective at removing airborne microorganisms (viruses in this case) with high efficiency. This directly supports the claim that air purifiers effectively remove airborne microorganisms, including bacteria and viruses.

All experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 25°C and humidity of 50%. Most bacteria (excluding B. subtilis) rapidly decreased on the functional filter.

Therefore, in order to minimize the risks associated with this pandemic, an efficient, robust and affordable air‐borne virus removal filters are highly demanded for prevention of spreading viruses in hospitals, transportation hubs, schools, and/or other venues with high human turn‐over. Respirators such as N95, N99 and N100 as well as surgical masks have been widely used. To date, there is no filter standards or special filter technologies tailored for effectively adsorbing the airborne viruses.

Researchers believed that the positive surface charge of filtration material is an important key to efficiently adsorb the negatively charged viruses. Nanocellulose has emerged as a new class of biobased material with promising potential application in the filtration of viruses.

In an environmentally controlled full-scale laboratory chamber (87 m<sup>3</sup>), and an indoor therapy pool building, the mitigation ability of air filters was assessed by comparing concentrations of total bacteria, culturable bacteria, and airborne endotoxin with and without the air filters operating under otherwise similar conditions. Controlled chamber tests with pure cultures of aerosolized Mycobacterium parafortuitum cells showed that the HUVAF unit tested provided an equivalent air-exchange rate of 11 hr<sup>−1</sup>. Using this equivalent air-exchange rate as a design basis, three HUVAFs were installed in an indoor therapy pool building for bioaerosol mitigation, and their effectiveness was studied over a 2-year period. The HUVAFs reduced concentrations of culturable bacteria by 69 and 80% during monitoring periods executed in respective years.

The combining filter method was used to reduce the air pollution indoor such as that particulate matter and gases pollution that affected in health and productivity. Using particle filters in industrial HVAC systems (factories and manufacturing process) does not enough to remove all the indoor pollution. The main objective of this study is to investigate the impact of combination filters for particle and gases removal efficiency. The combining method is by using two filters (particulate filter pre-filter and carbon filter) to reduce particle matter and gases respectively. The purpose of this study is to use minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV filter) rating 13 and activated carbon filter (ACF) to remove indoor air pollution and controlling the air change rate to enhance the air quality and energy saving. It was concluded that the combination filter showed good removal efficiency of particle up to 90.76% and 89.25% for PM<inf>10</inf> and PM<inf>2.5</inf> respectively. The pressure drop across the filters was small compared with the high-efficiency filters. The filtration efficiency of combination filters after three months' was better than efficiency by the new MERV filter alone.,Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim states that combination filters “do not experience pressure drops,” but the reference explicitly notes that there is a pressure drop across the combination filters—albeit smaller than that of high-efficiency filters. While the reference does support that combination filters are more effective than a new MERV filter alone, it directly contradicts the absolute claim of no pressure drop.

Controlling exposure to bioaerosols is important for disease control and prevention. In this study, we evaluated the efficacies of various functional filters coated with antimicrobial chemicals in deactivating representative microorganisms on filters or as bioaerosols. Tested functional filters were coated with different chemicals that included (i) Ginkgo and sumac, (ii) Ag-apatite and guanidine phosphate, (iii) SiO<inf>2</inf>, ZnO, and Al<inf>2</inf>O<inf>3</inf>, and (iv) zeolite. To evaluate the filters, we used a model ventilation system (1) to evaluate the removal efficiency of bacteria (Escherichia coli and Legionella pneumophila), bacterial spores (Bacillus subtilis spore), and viruses (MS2 bacteriophage) on various functional filters, and (2) to characterize the removal efficiency of these bioaerosols. All experiments were performed at a constant temperature of 25°C and humidity of 50%. Most bacteria (excluding B. subtilis) rapidly decreased on the functional filter. Therefore, we confirmed that functional filters have antimicrobial effects. Additionally, we evaluated the removal efficiency of various bioaerosols by these filters. We used a six-jet collision nebulizer to generate microbial aerosols and introduced it into the environmental chamber. We then measured the removal efficiency of functional filters with and without a medium-efficiency filter. Most bioaerosol concentrations did not significantly decrease by the functional filter only but decreased by a combination of functional and medium-efficiency filter.

s_999,Contradiction,"Drawbacks: Potential By-Product Emission: While some air cleaning devices may emit hazardous by-products, such as ozone, it is likely that all air cleaners pose similar health risks, as indicated by the findings from one air cleaner system during testing .","Introduction: The widespread transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus has increased scientific and societal interest in air cleaning technologies, and their potential to mitigate the airborne spread of microorganisms. Here we evaluate room scale use of five mobile air cleaning devices. Methods: A selection of air cleaners, containing high efficiency filtration, was tested using an airborne bacteriophage challenge. Assessments of bioaerosol removal efficacy were undertaken using a decay measurement approach over 3 h, with air cleaner performance compared with bioaerosol decay rate without an air cleaner in the sealed test room. Evidence of chemical by-product emission was also checked, as were total particle counts. Results: Bioaerosol reduction, exceeding natural decay, was observed for all air cleaners. Reductions ranged between devices from <2-log per m3 room air for the least effective, to a >5-log reduction for the most efficacious systems. One system generated detectable ozone within the sealed test room, but ozone was undetectable when the system was run in a normally ventilated room. Total particulate air removal trends aligned with measured airborne bacteriophage decline. Discussion: Air cleaner performance differed, and this could relate to individual air cleaner flow specifications as well as test room conditions, such as air mixing during testing. However, measurable reductions in bioaerosols, beyond natural airborne decay rate, were observed. Conclusion: Under the described test conditions, air cleaners containing high efficiency filtration significantly reduced bioaerosol levels. The best performing air cleaners could be investigated further with improved assay sensitivity, to enable measurement of lower residual levels of bioaerosols.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that “all air cleaners pose similar health risks” based on the finding that “one system generated detectable ozone.” The reference reports testing five devices, checking for chemical by-product emissions, and finding ozone emission in only one system (and only under sealed conditions). It does not report hazardous by-products from the other four devices. Thus the claim’s blanket generalization (“all air cleaners pose similar health risks”) is directly contradicted by the reference’s observation that only one device produced ozone and the others did not.

Radiographs allow for precise assessment of the acromion and glenoid morphology, which are crucial for CSA measurement.","Background: Accurate assessment of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) is important in clinical evaluation of degenerative rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the CSA, developed a classification system to identify malpositioned radiographs, and assessed the relationship between the CSA and demographic factors. Methods: Glenoid height, width, and retroversion were measured on 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions of 68 cadaver scapulae. A digitally reconstructed radiograph was aligned perpendicular to the scapular plane, and retroversion was corrected to obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) view. In 10 scapulae, incremental anteversion/retroversion and flexion/extension views were generated. The CSA was measured, and a clinically applicable classification system was developed to detect views with >2° change in CSA vs. true AP view. Results: The average CSA was 33° ± 4°. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.81) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Views beyond 5° anteversion, 8° retroversion, 15° flexion, and 26° extension resulted in >2° deviation of the CSA compared with the true AP view. The classification system was capable of detecting aberrant viewing perspectives with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 53%. Correlations between glenoid size and CSA were small (. R≤0.3), and CSA did not vary by gender (. P=.426) or side (. P=.821). Conclusions: The CSA was most susceptible to malposition in anteversion/retroversion. Deviations as little as 5° in anteversion resulted in a CSA >2° from true AP view. A new classification system refines the ability to collect true AP radiographs of the scapula. The CSA was unaffected by demographic factors.
[3]: Subacromial impingement syndrome results from irritation of the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles in the subacromial space and may manifest as a range of pathologies. However, subacromial impingement is a dynamic condition for which imaging reveals predisposing factors but no pathognomonic indicators. Also, the usual imaging features of subacromial impingement may be seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Therefore, imaging is able to detect tears and describe the risk factors of impingement but cannot confirm subacromial impingement. Radiographs allow assessment of the morphology of the acromion and its lateral extension by means of the acromial index and the critical shoulder angle, which may increase in cases of subacromial impingement. Ultrasound is necessary to evaluate a tendon tear and is the only tool that provides dynamic information, which is essential to assessing dynamic conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the assessment of associated intraarticular abnormalities, joint effusion, and bone marrow edema. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of subacromial impingement and discuss recent advances in the imaging of subacromial impingement and the role of radiography, ultrasound, and MRI in differentiating normal from pathologic findings.",Entailment,"justification: The claim states that ultrasound is best for dynamic soft‐tissue evaluation and that radiographs are typically used for measuring the critical shoulder angle (CSA) because they accurately depict bone structures and angles, allowing precise assessment of acromion and glenoid morphology. Reference [3] explicitly says that ultrasound “is the only tool that provides dynamic information” for tendon evaluation, and it also states that radiographs “allow assessment of the morphology of the acromion and its lateral extension by means of … the critical shoulder angle.” The radiographic CSA study further demonstrates using true AP radiographs to measure CSA and assess scapular morphology.

In the past 2 decades, usage of high-volume–low-pressure microcuffed tracheal tubes in smaller children has increased. However, there is paucity of evidence of its usage in smaller children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery. The aim of this study was to assess if microcuff endotracheal tubes in neonates and younger children undergoing congenital cardiac surgery is associated with better outcomes than uncuffed tubes. Methods. We carried out this single-center, prospective, randomized study between June and November 2016. Eighty patients were randomized into those receiving microcuff tracheal tubes and conventional uncuffed tubes. Primary outcome was stridor postextubation. Secondary outcomes measured included number of tube changes, volume of anesthetic gases required, and cost incurred. Results. The 2 groups were comparable in terms of baseline characteristics and duration of intubation. Incidence of stridor was significantly higher in conventional uncuffed tubes (12 [30%] vs 4 [10%]; P =.04) and so was the number of tube changes required (17/40 [42.5%] vs 2/40 [5%]; P ≤.001). Tube change was associated with more than 3-fold risk of stridor (odds ratio = 3.92; 95% confidence interval = 1.23-12.43). Isoflurane (29.14 ± 7.01 mL vs19.2 ± 4.81 mL; P <.0001) and oxygen flow requirement (P <.0001) and the resultant cost (7.46 ± 1.4 vs 5.77 ± 1.2 US$; P <.0001) were all significantly higher in the conventional uncuffed group.

This leads to significant cost reduction that offsets the higher costs associated with usage of a microcuff tracheal tube.",Entailment,"justification: The reference reports a randomized study in neonates undergoing congenital cardiac surgery comparing microcuffed versus conventional uncuffed tracheal tubes. It shows that the uncuffed group had a significantly higher incidence of postextubation stridor (30% vs 10%; P = .04), a greater number of tube changes (42.5% vs 5%; P ≤ .001), increased anesthetic gas requirements (higher isoflurane volume and oxygen flow; P < .0001), and higher resultant costs.

Evidence: A new magnesium-aluminum-zinc-calcium-manganese (Mg-Ca) alloy showed promise as a biodegradable tracheal stent, demonstrating good cytocompatibility and corrosion resistance in preliminary studies .","Airway obstruction conditions are relatively rarely observed in clinical settings but nevertheless, extremely challenging to handle, especially when observed in pediatric patients. Several surgical procedures, including tracheal resection, end-to-end tracheal anastomosis, and tracheoplasty, have been developed and practised of late, to treat airway obstruction. However, the clinical outcome is typically not satisfactory due to airway restenosis conditions that develop following surgery. Various types of stents are currently available for airway stenting ranging from non-degradable silicone tubes and bio-inert metallic stents (bare or coated with polymer matrix) to hybrid silicone tubes strengthened by metallic cores, but none of the stents provides the satisfactory long-term effectiveness. Therefore, there is a significant clinical need for a biodegradable airway stent that would maintain airway patency and totally degrade over time after meeting the desired objectives. The present study aims to investigate biodegradable magnesium-aluminum-zinc-calcium-manganese (AZXM) alloy as a potential tracheal stent. The new AZXM alloy was fabricated by partially replacing aliminum in commercial AZ31 alloy with calcium. The present study demonstrates that calcium preferentially segregates along the grain boundaries as intermetallic phases (Mg <inf>2</inf> Ca) and is homogeneously distributed in the magnesium matrix. The extruded AZXM alloy showed less pitting, higher corrosion resistance in Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) compared to the as-cast and solution-treated AZXM alloys and exhibited optimized mechanical properties. In vitro cytotoxicity evaluation using human trachea epithelial cells demonstrated excellent cyto-compatibility of AZXM alloys compared to pure Mg and commercial AZ31 validated by a very preliminary rabbit in vivo tracheal model study. Preliminary results show that the approach to use biodegradable AZXM alloys as a tracheal stent is indeed promising, although further alloy processing is required to improve the ductility needed followed by a more exhaustive in vivo study to demonstrate full viability for stent applications.",Entailment,"justification: The reference outlines the clinical need for a biodegradable airway stent that maintains patency and fully degrades over time, then presents the new AZXM (Mg–Al–Zn–Ca–Mn) alloy as a candidate. It reports that the extruded AZXM alloy has higher corrosion resistance, optimized mechanical properties, excellent cytocompatibility in vitro, and promising preliminary in vivo results in a rabbit tracheal model. This directly supports the claim that the new Mg–Ca alloy shows promise as a biodegradable tracheal stent with good cytocompatibility and corrosion resistance.

To evaluate the relationship between free SC and SIgA, the influence of maternal factors (vaccination during pregnancy, allergy, previous infections, nutrition, mode of delivery and active lifestyle) on the concentrations of those secretory immune components in human milk was investigated. Methods: Concentration of active free SC and SIgA in 124 milk samples from 91 mothers were measured via ELISA. Results: Free SC in milk from Tdap-vaccinated mothers was lower than the Tdap-flu-vaccinated, flu-vaccinated or Rhogam-vaccinated mothers. Free SC in mothers who had a cesarean delivery was higher than mothers who had a vaginal delivery. Free SC in the nonallergic group was higher than the allergic group. Free SC was higher in mothers who rarely/never eat junk food, than in mothers who always/frequently eat junk food.

[10]: Background: Preterm infants fed fortified human milk (HM) grow more slowly than those fed preterm formulas. These differences could be related to the variability in the macronutrient composition of expressed HM, resulting in inadequate nutrient intake in relation to the estimated needs of the preterm infants. Objectives: The aim of this article was to show the variability in HM composition from an infant's own mother's milk (OMM) or pooled HM from the milk bank. The second objective was to evaluate the advantages of individual fortification on nutritional intakes over standard fortification. Design: The macronutrient composition of 428 OMM, 138 HM pools from single donors, 224 pools from multiple donors, and 14 pools from colostral milk was determined by using a mid-infrared analyzer. Individualized fortification was performed after analysis of the milk samples in 2 steps: adjustment of fat content up to 4 g/dL, followed by the addition of an HM fortifier to provide 4.3 g · kg <sup>-1</sup> · d<sup>-1</sup> according to the daily prescribed volume of feeding. Nutritional intakes resulting from the individualized fortification were compared with calculated intakes resulting from standard fortification (HM fortifier: 4 packets/dL). Results: The variability in contents of fat, protein, and energy was high for all types of HM samples. Compared with standard fortification, individual fortification significantly reduced the variability in nutritional intakes, allowing the maintenance of protein intake and the protein:energy ratio in the range of the nutritional recommendations. Conclusions: The variability in expressed HM with respect to its protein and energy content is high. This variability persists after standard fortification, possibly resulting in under- or overnutrition. Because both over- and undernutrition confer risks in later development, individualized fortification optimizes protein and energy intake. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes individualized (targeted/tailored) fortification as adjusting human milk based on its measured macronutrient composition (fat, protein, energy) and shows that this method “optimizes protein and energy intake,” reducing variability and keeping nutrient ratios within recommendations.

Individualized fortification methods are recommended to ensure that all preterm infants achieve optimal growth and development without any risk of nutrient inadequacy .","Nutrition support of the premature infant must be designed to compensate for metabolic and gastrointestinal immaturity, immunologic compromise, and associated medical conditions. Nutritional needs are determined based on intrauterine rates of growth and nutrient accretion.1 The beneficial effects of human milk extend to the feeding of premature infants (Chapter 26). Human milk is capable of satisfying most of the needs of premature infants if careful attention is given to nutritional status. Nevertheless, because of their specialized needs the human milkfed premature infant may require nutrient supplementation, or fortification, to maintain optimal nutritional status while deriving benefits from enhanced host defense, neurologic development, and gastrointestinal function. The nutritional adequacy of human milk for premature infants may be limited for several reasons. The nutrient content of the milk may be inadequate for their needs and the variability in nutrient content results in an unpredictable nutrient intake for an infant who cannot feed ad libitum. Infants often receive restricted milk intakes. Mothers often are unable to supply sufficient milk to meet the needs of the infant throughout the hospitalization. As a consequence, nutrient inadequacy may manifest in the premature infant fed unfortified human milk. This review will focus on the feeding of fortified human milk to the premature infant. Composition of preterm milk Milk from mothers who give birth prematurely (preterm milk) generally has greater concentrations of immune proteins, lipid, energy, vitamins, calcium, sodium, and trace elements than in corresponding term milk.

The claim makes two main points: (1) that human milk fortification consists of adding proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and immune components, and that these additions alone fully satisfy all preterm infants’ nutritional needs; and (2) that individualized fortification methods are recommended so that “all preterm infants achieve optimal growth and development without any risk of nutrient inadequacy.”  

Reference [1]–[3] do confirm that human milk fortification is used to supplement nutrients (notably proteins, lipids, vitamins, minerals, and immune proteins) that might otherwise be insufficient in unfortified human milk, and they endorse individualized fortification (“adjustable” or “targeted”) to improve protein intakes and growth. They show that standard fortification can still leave infants protein-underfed and that individualized methods help address that issue.  

However, the reference does not explicitly mention adding antioxidants (nor does it claim that fortification “alone” guarantees the full spectrum of nutritional needs). Nor does it assert there is “no risk of nutrient inadequacy” once individualized fortification is applied. The reference actually highlights ongoing variability in human milk composition and the need for careful monitoring.

The functional connectivity was analyzed using the method of phase lag index (PLI). We constructed weighted network and calculated the network topology characteristics based on PLI, subsequently. Finally, the signedrank test was used for statistical analysis. We found that the changes of functional connectivity could be detected mainly between functional regions rather than inside regions. The functional connectivity at lower frequency band (theta and alpha) was significantly increased, and was opposite at higher frequency band (beta, gamma, and gamma<inf>2</inf>).

Material and Method: Fourteen participants were randomly assigned to receive LF-rTMS or sham stimulation conditions. All participants underwent RTG training after the stimulation. Corticospinal excitability (CE) of the non-lesioned hemisphere, the total time of the wolf motor function test (WMFT) for dexterity tasks, maximum aperture, and movement time of RTG actions were evaluated at baseline, after the stimulation, and after RTG training. Results: Significant differences between interaction (group x time) were found in the total time of WMFT. The CE of nonlesioned hemisphere diminished after LF-rTMS and showed moderate correlation with the reduction in time of RTG actions after the stimulation. The total time of WMFT and RTG actions reduced after motor training only in the LF-rTMS group. No change was observed in maximum aperture in either group.

However, there is a lack of longitudinal studies on TBI that follow DTI changes over time and correlate findings with long-term clinical outcome. We performed a prospective longitudinal study of 30 adult patients admitted for subacute rehabilitation following severe traumatic brain injury. DTI and conventional MRI were acquired at mean 8 weeks (5-11 weeks), and repeated in 23 of the patients at mean 12 months (9-15 months) post-trauma. Using a region-of-interest-based approach, DTI parameters were compared to those of healthy matched controls, scanned during the same time period and rescanned with a similar interval as that of patients. At the initial scan, fractional anisotropy was reduced in all the investigated white matter regions in patients compared to controls (P ≤ 0.01) due to decreased diffusivity parallel (λ<inf>∥</inf>) and increased diffusivity perpendicular (λ<inf>⊥</inf>) to axonal fibre direction. Fractional anisotropy in the cerebral peduncle correlated with ∼1 year Glasgow outcome scale score (r = 0.60, P<0.001) and in this sample predicted dichotomized outcome with 76% accuracy when taken alone, and with 100% accuracy in combination with clinical evaluation by functional independence measure at the time of the first scan.

DESIGN: Single center prospective cohort with consecutive inclusions. SETTING: Critical Care Neurosurgical Unit of a university hospital. PATIENTS: Forty-three TBI patients not responding to simple orders after sedation cessation and 15 healthy controls. INTERVENTIONS: A multimodal magnetic resonance imaging combining morphologic sequences, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and H proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was performed 24 ± 11 days after severe TBI. The ability of DTI and MRS to predict 1-year outcome was assessed by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Robustness of the classification was tested using a bootstrap procedure. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fractional anisotropy (FA) was computed as the mean of values at discrete brain sites in the infratentorial and supratentorial regions. The N-acetyl aspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratio was measured in the thalamus, lenticular nucleus, insular cortex, occipital periventricular white matter, and pons. After 1 year, 19 (44%) patients had unfavorable outcomes (death, persistent vegetative state, or minimally conscious state) and 24 (56%) favorable outcomes (normal consciousness with or without functional impairments). Analysis of variance was performed to compare FA and NAA/Cr in the two outcome groups and controls. FA and MRS findings showed highly significant differences between the outcome groups, with significant variables by LDA being supratentorial FA, NAA/Cr (pons), NAA/Cr (thalamus), NAA/Cr (insula), and infratentorial FA. LDA of combined FA and MRS data clearly separated the unfavorable outcome, favorable outcome, and control groups, with no overlap.

[3]: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of neurological damage and disability. Conventional imaging (CT scan or MRI) is highly sensitive in detecting lesions and provides important clinical information regarding the need for acute intervention. However, abnormalities detected by CT scan or conventional MRI have limited importance in the classification of the degree of clinical severity and in predicting patients' outcome. This can be explained by the widespread microscopic tissue damage occurring after trauma, which is not observable with the conventional structural imaging methods. Advances in neuroimaging over the past two decades have greatly helped in the clinical care and management of patients with TBI. The advent of newer and more sensitive imaging techniques is now being used to better characterize the nature and evolution of injury and the underlying mechanisms that lead to progressive neurodegeneration, recovery or subsequent plasticity. This review will describe the role of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic (MRS), an advanced MRI technique as related to its use in TBI. Proton MRS is a noninvasive approach that acquires metabolite information reflecting neuronal integrity and function from multiple brain regions and allows to assess clinical severity and to predict disease outcome. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes a prospective cohort study using multimodal MRI (combining DTI and proton MRS) to predict 1-year outcomes after severe TBI.

However, their standalone predictive power is limited when compared to combined models.","Objective Biomarkers ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) may help detect brain injury, assess its severity, and improve outcome prediction. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of these biomarkers during the first days after brain injury. Methods Serum UCH-L1 and GFAP were measured in 324 patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) enrolled in a prospective study. The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) or the extended version, Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE). Results Patients with full recovery had lower UCH-L1 concentrations on the second day and patients with favorable outcome had lower UCH-L1 concentrations during the first 2 days compared with patients with incomplete recovery and unfavorable outcome. Patients with full recovery and favorable outcome had significantly lower GFAP concentrations in the first 2 days than patients with incomplete recovery or unfavorable outcome. There was a strong negative correlation between outcome and UCH-L1 in the first 3 days and GFAP levels in the first 2 days. On arrival, both UCH-L1 and GFAP distinguished patients with GOS score 1-3 from patients with GOS score 4-5, but not patients with GOSE score 8 from patients with GOSE score 1-7. For UCH-L1 and GFAP to predict unfavorable outcome (GOS score ≤3), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.727, and 0.723, respectively. Neither UCHL-1 nor GFAP was independently able to predict the outcome when age, worst Glasgow Coma Scale score, pupil reactivity, Injury Severity Score, and Marshall score were added into the multivariate logistic regression model. Conclusions GFAP and UCH-L1 are significantly associated with outcome, but they do not add predictive power to commonly used prognostic variables in a population of patients with TBI of varying severities.
[5]: Background: Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a significant healthcare burden and its diagnosis remains a challenge in the emergency department. Serum biomarkers and advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have already demonstrated their potential to improve the detection of brain injury even in patients with negative computed tomography (CT) findings. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical value of a combinational use of both blood biomarkers and MRI in mTBI detection and their characterization in the acute setting (within 24 hours after injury). Methods: Nine patients with mTBI were prospectively recruited from the emergency department. Serum samples were collected at the time of hospital admission and every 6 hours up to 24 hours post injury. Neuronal (Ubiquitin C-terminal Hydrolase-L1 [UCH-L1]) and glial (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) biomarker levels were analyzed. Advanced MRI data were acquired at 9±6.91 hours after injury. Patients' neurocognitive status was assessed by using the Standard Assessment of Concussion (SAC) instrument. Results: The median serum levels of UCH-L1 and GFAP on admission were increased 4.9 folds and 10.6 folds, respectively, compared to reference values. Three patients were found to have intracranial hemorrhages on SWI, all of whom had very high GFAP levels. Total volume of brain white matter (WM) with abnormal fractional anisotropy (FA) measures of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were negatively correlated with patients' SAC scores, including delayed recall. Both increased and decreased DTI-FA values were observed in the same subjects. Serum biomarker level was not correlated with patients' DTI data nor SAC score. Conclusions: Blood biomarkers and advanced MRI may correlate or complement each other in different aspects of mTBI detection and characterization. GFAP might have potential to serve as a clinical screening tool for intracranial bleeding. UCH-L1 complements MRI in injury detection. Impairment at WM tracts may account for the patients' neurocognitive symptoms. © 2013 Kou et al.",Entailment,"justification:  
The first study demonstrates that serum UCH-L1 and GFAP levels are significantly associated with TBI outcomes (patients with full or favorable recovery had lower biomarker concentrations and there was a strong negative correlation between biomarker levels and outcome). It also shows that neither UCH-L1 nor GFAP adds independent predictive power once established clinical predictors (age, GCS score, etc.) are included in a multivariate model, i.e., their standalone predictive power is limited.  
The second study ([5]) further supports the notion that biomarkers alone do not fully capture injury characterization but can complement other modalities (advanced MRI) in combined models, underscoring that biomarker predictive power is greater when used alongside other measures.  
Together, these findings directly support the claim.

For each patient, we collected T1- and T2-weighted MRI data acutely and at the 6-month follow-up, as well as acute measures of injury severity (Glasgow Coma Scale), follow-up measures of functional impairment (Glasgow Outcome Scale-extended), and, in a subset of patients, neuropsychological measures of attention, executive functions, and episodic memory.ResultsIn the final cohort of 113 subcortical and 92 cortical datasets that survived (blind) quality control, extensive atrophy was observed over the first 6 months after injury across the brain. However, only atrophy within subcortical regions, particularly in the left thalamus, was associated with functional outcome and neuropsychological measures of attention, executive functions, and episodic memory. Furthermore, when brought together in an analytical model, longitudinal brain measurements could distinguish good from bad outcome with 90% accuracy, whereas acute brain and clinical measurements alone could achieve only 20% accuracy.ConclusionDespite great injury heterogeneity, secondary thalamic pathology is a measurable minimum common denominator mechanism directly relating biology to clinical measures of outcome and cognitive functioning, potentially linking the acute event and the longer-term disease of traumatic brain injury.",Entailment,"justification:  
The reference reports that for a cohort of traumatic brain injury patients, acute clinical measures alone (which include the Glasgow Coma Scale and follow-up functional impairment assessed by the Glasgow Outcome Scale–extended, as well as subset neuropsychological tests of attention, executive functions, and memory) could only predict 6-month outcome with about 20% accuracy. In contrast, longitudinal MRI measurements (i.e. imaging data) distinguished good versus bad outcomes with 90% accuracy. This directly shows that adding imaging data yields a large improvement over clinical/neuropsychological measures alone, supporting the claim that clinical scales (GOS-E and neuropsychological assessments) are crucial and that combining them with imaging data significantly improves predictive accuracy.

[7]: Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes (PNS) are a rare heterogeneous group of disorders associated with malignancy that can result in significant functional impairment. One syndrome in particular, paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD), may be severely disabling. PCD is a rare neurological syndrome, associated with active or subclinical cancer, characterized by acute or subacute onset cerebellar ataxia due to tumor-induced autoimmunity against cerebellar antigens. Treatment of paraneoplastic syndromes is generally unsatisfactory, but early diagnosis and treatment of PCD, which includes neurological treatment, immunotherapy and oncological treatment of associated malignancy, may improve the neurological prognosis. We reported the case of a 59-year-old woman who presented PCD as the first sign of ovarian cancer. Laboratory investigations showed the presence of anti-Yo antibodies in the serum. The brain MRI revealed specific modifications for PCD. After oncological treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and corticosteroid therapy, the oncological response was satisfactory, but no improvement of the neurologic symptoms was achieved.",Entailment,"justification: The claim’s first sentence (“Treatment typically includes addressing the underlying malignancy and may involve immunotherapy”) is directly supported by both references, which state that antitumor therapy and immunotherapy are essential components of PNS management.

Limited data availability in the medical field can lead to overfitting and large variance in segmentation results .,"In preoperative imaging, the demarcation of rectal cancer with magnetic resonance images provides an important basis for cancer staging and treatment planning. Recently, deep learning has greatly improved the state-of-the-art method in automatic segmentation. However, limitations in data availability in the medical field can cause large variance and consequent overfitting to medical image segmentation networks. In this study, we propose methods to reduce the model variance of a rectal cancer segmentation network by adding a rectum segmentation task and performing data augmentation; the geometric correlation between the rectum and rectal cancer motivated the former approach. Moreover, we propose a method to perform a bias-variance analysis within an arbitrary region-of-interest (ROI) of a segmentation network, which we applied to assess the efficacy of our approaches in reducing model variance. As a result, adding a rectum segmentation task reduced the model variance of the rectal cancer segmentation network within tumor regions by a factor of 0.90; data augmentation further reduced the variance by a factor of 0.89. These approaches also reduced the training duration by a factor of 0.96 and a further factor of 0.78, respectively. Our approaches will improve the quality of rectal cancer staging by increasing the accuracy of its automatic demarcation and by providing rectum boundary information since rectal cancer staging requires the demarcation of both rectum and rectal cancer. Besides such clinical benefits, our method also enables segmentation networks to be assessed with bias-variance analysis within an arbitrary ROI, such as a cancerous region.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly states that “limitations in data availability in the medical field can cause large variance and consequent overfitting to medical image segmentation networks,” which directly supports the claim that U-Net’s performance is significantly affected by training data availability and quality, leading to overfitting and high variance. Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the reference.

s_1101,Entailment,Uterine Fibroid Segmentation: Advanced Techniques: Adaptive Localized Region and Edge-Based Active Contour Models: These models are robust against initial contour sensitivity and can efficiently segment heterogeneous features in ultrasound images .,"Uterine fibroids segmentation in ultrasound images is of great importance in the definition of intra-operative planning of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate, robust and efficient uterine fibroid segmentation due to low quality of ultrasound images. In this study, the authors propose a novel adaptive localised region and edge-based active contour model using shape constraint and sub-global information to accurately and efficiently segment the uterine fibroids in ultrasound images with robustness against initial contour. The authors first define adaptive local radius for the localised region-based model and combine it with the edge-based model to accurately and efficiently capture image's heterogeneous features and edge features. Then, they incorporate a shape constraint to reduce boundary leakage or excessive contraction to obtain more accurate segmentation. To overcome the initialisation sensitivity, they introduce the sub-global information to prevent the curve from trapping into the local minima and obtain robust results. Furthermore, the authors optimise computation by adaptively sharing local region and employing the multi-scale segmentation method to achieve efficient segmentation. The proposed method is validated by uterine fibroid ultrasound images in HIFU therapy and the results demonstrate that it can achieve accurate, robust and efficient segmentation.",Entailment,"justification: The reference explicitly describes an adaptive localized region and edge-based active contour model that is designed to be robust against initial contour sensitivity (“with robustness against initial contour”) and to efficiently capture heterogeneous features and edge features in ultrasound images (“to accurately and efficiently capture image’s heterogeneous features and edge features”). The validation results further confirm accurate, robust, and efficient segmentation of uterine fibroids. This directly supports the claim.

s_1102,Unverifiable,General Ultrasound Image Segmentation: Specific Applications: Salivary Gland Ultrasound Segmentation: Accurate segmentation of the salivary glands is crucial for diagnosing salivary-related diseases. Techniques like semi-automatic minutiae matching and multi-atlas-based methods have shown promise in improving segmentation accuracy .,"Knowledge of in vivo thyroid volume has both diagnostic and therapeutic importance and could lead to a more precise quantification of absolute activity contained in the thyroid gland. However, the shape of thyroid gland is irregular and difficult to calculate. For precise estimation of thyroid volume by ultrasound imaging, this paper presents a novel semiautomatic minutiae matching method in thyroid gland ultrasonic image by means of thin-plate spline model. Registration consists of four basic steps: feature detection, feature matching, mapping function design, and image transformation and resampling. Due to the connectivity of thyroid gland boundary, we choose active contour model as feature detector, and radials from centric points for feature matching. The proposed approach has been used in thyroid gland ultrasound images registration. Registration results of 18 healthy adults' thyroid gland ultrasound images show this method consumes less time and energy with good objectivity than algorithms selecting landmarks manually.
[8]: Segmenting the thyroid gland in head and neck CT images is of vital clinical significance in designing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment plans. In this work, we evaluate and compare several multiple-atlas-based methods to segment this structure. Using the most robust method, we generate automatic segmentations for the thyroid gland and study their clinical applicability. The various methods we evaluate range from selecting a single atlas based on one of three similarity measures, to combining the segmentation results obtained with several atlases and weighting their contribution using techniques including a simple majority vote rule, a technique called STAPLE that is widely used in the medical imaging literature, and the similarity between the atlas and the volume to be segmented. We show that the best results are obtained when several atlases are combined and their contributions are weighted with a measure of similarity between each atlas and the volume to be segmented. We also show that with our data set, STAPLE does not always lead to the best results. Automatic segmentations generated by the combination method using the correlation coefficient (CC) between the deformed atlas and the patient volume, which is the most accurate and robust method we evaluated, are presented to a physician as 2D contours and modified to meet clinical requirements. It is shown that about 40% of the contours of the left thyroid and about 42% of the right thyroid can be used directly. An additional 21% on the left and 24% on the right require only minimal modification. The amount and the location of the modifications are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed. We demonstrate that, although challenged by large inter-subject anatomical discrepancy, atlas-based segmentation of the thyroid gland in IMRT CT images is feasible by involving multiple atlases. The results show that a weighted combination of segmentations by atlases using the CC as the similarity measure slightly outperforms standard combination methods, e.g. the majority vote rule and STAPLE, as well as methods selecting a single most similar atlas. The results we have obtained suggest that using our contours as initial contours to be edited has clinical value.",Unrelated and unverifiable,"justification: The claim concerns segmentation of the salivary glands in ultrasound images and cites semi‐automatic minutiae matching and multi‐atlas methods for that purpose. The reference, however, describes a semi‐automatic minutiae matching approach and multi‐atlas methods applied to the thyroid gland (in ultrasound and CT images), not the salivary glands. Since salivary gland anatomy and imaging characteristics differ from the thyroid, the reference does not provide direct evidence about salivary gland segmentation. Therefore, we cannot verify the claim based on the given reference.

s_1106,Entailment,Histological Characteristics of Basal Vacuolar Changes in cutaneous lupus erythematosus: Perifollicular Inflammation and Follicular Plugging: These features are significantly more common in lupus cases compared to other conditions like keratoses or carcinomas .,"Background: The clinical distribution and character of cutaneous lupus erythematosus lesions can simulate squamous neoplasms, leading physicians to submit a shave biopsy specimen with a differential diagnosis of squamous neoplasm. Objective: Our aim was to describe histologic features of interface dermatitis that cause difficulty in distinguishing between cutaneous lupus erythematosus and squamous neoplasia in shave biopsy specimens and to identify distinguishing criteria. Methods: Twenty-six biopsy specimens from 10 patients initially diagnosed with squamous neoplasia that ultimately proved to be cutaneous lupus erythematosus were identified. Comparisons were made of these to 38 control biopsies of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus and 34 control biopsies of keratoses/carcinomas without lupus. All biopsies were scored (0 or 1: absent or present) with respect to 11 histologic criteria. Results: The criteria of perifollicular inflammation, follicular plugging, vacuolar interface change, compact orthokeratosis, and acrosyringeal inflammation were significantly more common in the lupus cases than in the keratoses/carcinomas controls. The mean lupus case score was 6.88, lupus control score 6.55, and keratoses/carcinomas control score 5.08. Limitations: A limited number of patients were studied. Microscopic observations and assumptions with inherent subjectivity were used in establishing the histologic scores.

CD123 <sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are typically increased in lupus erythematosus, but have not been well studied in CTCL. We aimed to compare CD123 immunostaining and histopathological features in these conditions. Methods and results: Skin biopsies of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE, n = 18), lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP, n = 17), mycosis fungoides (MF, n = 25) and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL, n = 9) were retrospectively reviewed and immunostained with CD123. Percentage, distribution and clustering of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells were compared between CLE and MF and between LEP and SPTCL using χ <sup>2</sup> and two-tailed t-tests. A higher percentage of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells was observed in CLE than MF (P < 0.01), more frequently comprising ≥20% of the entire infiltrate (P < 0.01) and forming clusters (P < 0.01). Similarly, LEP showed a higher percentage of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells than SPTCL (P = 0.01), more frequently comprising ≥20% of the infiltrate (P = 0.04) and forming clusters (P = 0.01). Basal vacuolar change or dyskeratosis was observed in all CLE cases and in 48% cases of MF cases (P = 0.05). Plasma cells were readily identified in 76% cases of LEP but in none of the SPTCL cases (P = 0.01). Adipocyte rimming by lymphocytes, hyaline fat necrosis and fibrinoid/grungy necrosis did not significantly differ between LEP and SPTCL. Dermal mucin also failed to distinguish between groups. Conclusions: CD123 immunostaining is helpful in differentiating CLE from MF and LEP from SPTCL, but should be interpreted in conjunction with clinicopathological features and other ancillary studies to ensure accurate diagnosis.

s_1115,Contradiction,"A decrease in PRT after repeated eccentric exercises suggests changes in muscle properties, which could be relevant for assessing adhesions .","We investigated the effects of repeated eccentric exercise for rat medial gastrocnemius muscle on ankle joint stiffness and muscle connectin (titin) isoform composition (longer form, α-connectin; shorter form, β-connectin). Male Wistar rats were trained on a custom-made, isokinetic dynamometer (eccentric-exercise group, n = 6; sham-operated group, n = 6). The exercise session consisted of 20 eccentric contractions elicited by submaximal electric stimulations under anesthesia. The contracting muscle was forcibly lengthened by an isokinetic dorsiflexion of the ankle joint (velocity, 30°/s; range of motion, 45°). Rats in the eccentric-exercise group were trained every two days for 20 days (10 sessions in total). The static passive resistive torque (PRT) of 45° at the ankle joint was used as a measure of the joint stiffness, and was determined before and after the experimental period. After 10 sessions of eccentric exercise, the wet weight of medial gastrocnemius muscle significantly increased (P < 0.05), whereas the static PRT significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in the eccentric-exercise group, when compared to the sham-operated group. Myosin-ATPase staining showed a decrease in the number of type IIb/IId fibers (P < 0.001) and an increase in the number of type IIa fibers (P < 0.05). However, no significant difference was seen in the connectin (titin) isoform composition between the eccentric-exercise group and the sham-operated group, suggesting that the reduction in PRT was not due to change in resting mechanical properties of muscle fibers.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference confirms that repeated eccentric exercise led to a significant decrease in static PRT, indicating altered muscle behavior. It also shows that this decrease was not due to changes in titin-based resting mechanical properties, implying that other muscle properties (e.g., fiber type composition) changed.

Dynamometric indicators of fatigue from repeated maximal concentric isokinetic plantar flexion contractions are independent of knee flexion angles and age but differ for males and females.

Knee flexion (KF) also impacts plantar flexion function from where stems use of 08 and 458 angles of KF for clinical assessment of gastrocnemius and soleus, respectively. The influence of KF, sex, and age on dynamometric indicators of plantar flexion fatigue was examined in 28 males and 28 females recruited in 2 different age groups (older and younger than 40 years). Each subject performed 50 maximal concentric isokinetic plantar flexions at 60-degree angle per$second with 08 and 458 angles of KF. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions were determined before and after isokinetic trials and maximal, minimal, and normalized linear slopes of peak power during testing. Main effects of and 2- way interactions between KF, sex, age, and order of testing were explored using mixed-effect models and stepwise regressions. At angles of 0° and 45°, the fatigue indicators in younger and older individuals were similar and not influenced by testing order. However, peak isokinetic power and isometric torque declined to greater extents in males than females and, moreover, KF exerted greater impacts on the absolute plantar flexion performance and maximal-to-minimal reduction in isokinetic power in males. Because KF wielded no pronounced effect on fatigue indicators, this test may perhaps be used over time with no major concern regarding the exact knee angle.

[4]: Celiac disease is a multi-factorial chronic inflammatory intestinal disease, characterized by malabsorption resulting from mucosal injury after ingestion of wheat gluten or related rye and barley proteins. Inappropriate T-cell-mediated immune response against ingested gluten in genetically predisposed people, leads to characteristic histological lesions, as villous atrophy and intraepithelial lymphocytosis.

[7]: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects genetically predisposed individuals who are sensitive to gluten and related proteins. It affects children and adults with increasing prevalence in the older age groups. Both adaptive and innate immune responses play role in CD pathogenesis which results in damage of lamina propria and deposition of intraepithelial lymphocytes. There are other proposed mechanisms of CD pathogenesis like gastrointestinal infections, intestinal microbiota, and early introduction of gluten. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical symptoms and serological testing, though a majority of cases are asymptomatic, and small intestinal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Celiac disease is generally associated with other autoimmune diseases, and it is advisable to test these patients for diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, thyroid diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. The patient with a new diagnosis of CD requires close follow-up after starting treatment to see symptom improvement and check dietary compliance. A newly diagnosed patient is advised to follow with a dietitian to better understand the dietary restrictions as about 20% of patients stay symptomatic even after starting treatment due to noncompliance or poor understanding of diet restrictions. The most effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet, but work on non-dietary therapy is in process and few medications are in the clinical trial phase.
[8]: Background: Celiac disease is a multifactorial and polygenic disease with autoimmune features. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to gluten. Elimination of gluten from the diet leads to disease remission, which is the basis for today's treatment of the disease. There is an unmet need for new alternative treatments. Key Messages: Genetic findings point to adaptive immunity playing a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. MHC is by far the single most important genetic factor in the disease. In addition, a number of non-MHC genes, the majority of which have functions related to T cells and B cells, also contribute to the genetic predisposition, but each of them has modest effect. The primary MHC association is with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These HLA molecules present gluten epitopes to CD4+ T cells which can be considered to be the master regulators of the immune reactions that lead to the disease. The epitopes which the T cells recognize are usually deamidated, and this deamidation is mediated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Celiac disease patients have disease-specific antibodies. In addition to antibodies to gluten, these include autoantibodies to TG2. Antibodies to deamidated gluten are nearly as specific for celiac disease as the anti-TG2 antibodies. Both types of antibodies appear only to be produced in subjects who are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 when they are consuming gluten. Conclusion: It is hardly coincidental that TG2 is implicated in T-cell epitope formation and at the same time a target for autoantibodies. Understanding this connection is one of the major challenges for obtaining a complete understanding of how gluten causes tissue destruction and remodeling of the mucosa in the small bowel.",Entailment,"justification: The references explicitly state that celiac disease is a polygenic disorder in which MHC (HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8) class II haplotypes are the strongest genetic risk factors. This directly supports the claim that the disease is strongly associated with MHC class II genes.

[15]: Introduction: celiac disease is a chronic condition that requires continued treatment, with the resultant impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of people who suffer it. Most studies in this field have used generic questionnaires to measure HRQOL in celiac patients. It was therefore decided to conduct a study to translate into Spanish and validate a specific questionnaire for celiac disease, the Celiac Disease Quality Of Life Survey (CD-QOL). Objectives: to translate and validate in Spanish the specific celiac disease questionnaire CD-QOL. Methods: a multicenter, prospective, observational study was designed consisting of two phases: In the first phase, the questionnaire was translated and adapted into Spanish using the translation/back translation procedure and an understandability study. In the second phase, internal consistency of the translated questionnaire was analyzed. For this, results of the CD-QOL were compared to those of EuroQol and the Daily Fatigue Impact Scale (D-FIS). Understandability of the translated and adapted questionnaire was tested in six patients, and the validation study was done in 298 celiac patients (201 treated with a gluten-free diet and 97 at diagnosis). Results: in both celiac groups, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was high (0.90), feasibility was excellent (99.2 % of patients completed all questions), and there were no ceiling and floor effects. Spearman correlation to EuroQol and D-FIS was statistically significant (p < 0.05). CD-QOL score was different depending on whether state of health was good, fair, or poor based on the EuroQol score.

[10]: Introduction. Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, can be defined as a persistent intolerance of wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamines in the small intestinal mucosa of genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical picture of the disease can often be misleading because it varies greatly from patient to patient, resulting in delayed diagnosis.To analyze the clinical case of a child with celiac disease and acquired ichthyosis. Results. The disease, until a final diagnosis was established, had a severe course due to gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders. From the age of 1.5 years, the child had frequent diarrhea, bloating, which is why she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospital at the place of residence. However, there was no effect from the ongoing therapeutic measures, and other symptoms such as vomiting, peripheral edema, deficiency of height and weight, and severe peeling of the skin joined in. The diagnosis was finally confirmed at the age of 2.5 years after the test for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA (fifty-fold excess relative to the norm). A genetic study revealed alleles of genes responsible for predisposition to celiac disease. The results of a biopsy of the mucous membrane of the duodenum had signs of atrophy, lymphoid infiltration, corresponding to a lesion of the small intestine according to the classification Marsh III. Microscopic examination of the skin – hyperkeratosis with a decrease in the granular layer. On the basis of the obtained data, the diagnosis was made: Celiac disease, active phase, severe course, complicated by proteinenergy insufficiency severe degree, exudative enteropathy syndrome, 2 degree anemia, concomitant diagnosis: acquired ichthyosis. The girl was prescribed a gluten-free diet, and symptomatic drug therapy was carried out. In dynamics, the condition has improved. After 6 months, at the second visit, gastrointestinal and skin symptoms were absent, physical development was age-appropriate. Conclusions. The classic form of celiac disease usually manifests itself with several major symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. In this article we wanted to talk about a rare combination of celiac disease with ichthyosis, therefore, practitioners should be wary of a combination of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms.

To date, there is little evidence related to the effects of salt reduction on isolated systolic hypertension (ISH). A total of 126 hypertensive patients were divided into an ISH group (n = 51) and a non-ISH (NISH) group (n = 75). The members of each group were then randomly assigned to low sodium salt (LSSalt) or normal salt (NSalt) diets for 6 months. Their blood pressure was measured every 2 months.

The mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) had no significant differences in the ISH and NISH groups. No obvious renin angiotensin system activation was found after LSSalt intervention. Regarding the urinary excretion of electrolytes and blood biochemical assays, the LSSalt treatment had the same effects on the ISH group as on the NISH group.

s_1155,Entailment,"Sodium: High Sodium Intake: Conversely, high sodium intake is associated with increased blood pressure. Chronic high sodium intake can lead to pathological changes in vasopressin neurons, contributing to vasopressin-dependent hypertension .","Purpose of Review: Dietary salt intake increases both plasma sodium and osmolality and therefore increases vasopressin (VP) release from the neurohypophysis. Although this effect could increase blood pressure by inducing fluid reabsorption and vasoconstriction, acute activation of arterial baroreceptors inhibits VP neurons via GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors to oppose high blood pressure. Here we review recent findings demonstrating that this protective mechanism fails during chronic high salt intake in rats. Recent Findings: Two recent studies showed that chronic high sodium intake causes an increase in intracellular chloride concentration in VP neurons. This effect causes GABA<inf>A</inf> receptors to become excitatory and leads to the emergence of VP-dependent hypertension. One study showed that the increase in intracellular chloride was provoked by a decrease in the expression of the chloride exporter KCC2 mediated by local secretion of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and activation of TrkB receptors. Summary: Prolonged high dietary salt intake can cause pathological plasticity in a central homeostatic circuit that controls VP secretion and thereby contribute to peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension.",Entailment,"justification: The reference states that prolonged high dietary salt intake increases vasopressin (VP) release and, under chronic conditions, leads to pathological plasticity in VP neurons (through altered GABAA signaling and chloride homeostasis) which in turn contributes to VP-dependent hypertension.

Material and Methods: All diagnostic and interventional cardiac catheterization procedures from a single tertiary center were analyzed from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015, one year before and after implementing lower starting pulse fluoroscopy rates. The radiation dose was quantified as air kerma dose (mGy) and dose-area product (DAP; µGy/m<sup>2</sup>). Radiation exposure was analyzed for diagnostic and interventional procedures; the diagnostic group was subdivided into cyanotic and acyanotic patients, whereas the interventional group was subdivided according to the most common indications. Results: A total of 786 procedures were analyzed. The median fluoroscopy times and contrast amounts did not show a statistically significant difference between both periods (487 vs. 456 sec-onds and 42.5 vs. 45.3 cm<sup>3</sup>). The median air kerma for all procedures showed an 88% reduction after implementing lower pulse fluoroscopy rates (340-41 mGy). The doses were reduced significantly for diagnostic and interventional angiograms from 470 mGy and 162 mGy to 40 mGy and154 mGy. Among all patient groups, the most striking decrease was observed in the diagnostic procedures we use, of which fluoroscopy is more prominent than cine angiography. Conclusion: We claim that novel radiation dose reduction protocols could be easily applied without increasing fluoroscopy time or losing image quality.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that it is unlikely modern protocols can substantially reduce radiation exposure without compromising image quality. The reference, by contrast, reports an 88% reduction in radiation dose (air kerma) after lowering pulse fluoroscopy rates and explicitly states that these novel dose reduction protocols were implemented “without increasing fluoroscopy time or losing image quality.” Thus, the reference directly opposes the claim’s assertion, providing evidence that significant reductions in radiation exposure are achievable without degrading image quality.

One was sent to all active members from the Society of Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) who self-identified Structural Heart Disease or Congenital Heart Disease as a practice area. The second survey was conducted through the Pediatric Interventional Early Career Society (PICES) aimed at pediatric and adult congenital interventionalists in their first seven years after training. The total survey sample sizes were 1,535 and 112, respectively. Results: Response rates for the SCAI and PICES surveys were 15% (237/1,535) and 75% (84/112), respectively. Most respondents (74%) worked at institutions with pediatric and adult facilities in proximity (major medical centers). While 75% of SCAI respondents believed complex transcatheter procedures should be performed by ACHD-trained interventionalists or multidisciplinary teams, only 32% reported such care is being provided at the present time. Most pediatric and adult cardiologists surveyed (73%) do not believe current interventional fellowships provide adequate training for proficiency in ACHD interventions.

[4]: Ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in western countries. According to the data from the American Heart Association, coronary artery disease causes about one of every six deaths in the United States. Each year, an estimated 785,000 Americans will have a new coronary attack, about 470,000 will have a recurrent attack, and an additional 195,000 will have a silent fi rst myocardial infarction. Thus, approximately every 25 s, an American will have a coronary event; approximately every minute, someone will die of one [1]. The pathophysiological process underlying most ischemic heart disease is atherosclerosis of coronary arteries. Atheroma formation, with or without thrombus, can lead to stenosis in coronary arteries, resulting in a reduction in coronary blood flow and oxygen supply. A sudden and significant reduction in coronary blood flow, most commonly from rupture of plaques in the coronary arteries, can cause myocardial infarction. A large number of cardiomyocytes die, and cardiac muscles in the infarcted area lose their striations. The death of cardiomyocytes invokes the recruitment of inflammatory cells at the infarct border, which remove the necrotic cell debris by phagocytosis [2]. As a result, the infarct area becomes thin and non-contractile and may lead to infarct rupture, which accounts for 15�30 % of deaths in the fi rst week after infarction [3, 4].",Opposite meaning,"justification: The reference describes acute coronary syndromes as resulting from rupture of unstable (vulnerable) plaques and does not state that stable plaques remain intact or confer protection against thrombosis and ACS.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that predisposes to coronary artery disease (CAD), stroke and peripheral arterial disease, responsible for most of the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.

Obesity is a risk factor for CVD but this association is not fully understood. Altered levels of obesity related peptides such as ghrelin may play an important role in this pathophysiology. Recent evidence indicates that ghrelin features several cardiovascular activities, including increased myocardial contractility, vasodilatation and protection from myocardial infarction. Recent data demonstrate that ghrelin can influence important key events in atherogenesis and thus they may play a role in atherosclerosis. In this review we present the latest data from recent animal and clinical studies which focus on a novel approach to ghrelin as a potential therapeutic agent in the treatment of a complex disease like atherosclerosis.

They provide continuous blood flow, which may reduce ventricular work and could potentially improve patient outcomes, although some studies suggest they might also lead to adverse events like thrombus and stroke .","Over the past two decades, rotary blood pumps (RBPs) have gained clinical acceptance and market share due to their smaller size, and increased efficiency and durability compared to pulsatile blood pumps. RBPs constitute the second and third generations of the artificial hearts. As a continuous flow system, RBP augments perfusion and provides sufficient systemic perfusion for patients, while reducing ventricular work. RBP can unload the native ventricles continuously as partial or full support device. RBP consists of a rotating impeller, which is enclosed in a housing. The impeller can be mainly classified into axial flow (AF) and centrifugal flow (CF), though mixed flow (MF) pumps have also been developed. The Archimedes screw was used to design the AF pumps, where the direction of blood flow is parallel to the_ axis of the impeller. Most AF RBPs belong to second-generation pumps and can operate at speeds of 7000–50,000 rpm. In comparison, CF pumps have a flow direction that is perpendicular to the_ rotational axis of the impeller. Centrifugal pumps typically are larger in diameter, smaller in length, and have higher hydraulic efficiencies and the speeds are lower than those of AF pumps. Axial and centrifugal pumps are suspended using physical bearings, hydrodynamic bearings, or are magnetically levitated. This chapter will introduce AF and CF pumps in design, performance, and the comparisons in their clinical applications.
[6]: Rotary blood pumps have demonstrated superior device safety and performance compared with first-generation volume displacement pumps. The first generation of axial and centrifugal flow devices operate at constant speeds (rpm) delivering continuous end-organ blood flow, but with diminished vascular pulsatility and non-phasic volume unloading. It has been speculated that the resulting non-physiologic hemodynamics may be associated with clinically significant adverse events including thrombus, stroke, and bleeding. Subsequently, pump speed modulation algorithms are being developed in an attempt to achieve physiologic pulsatile pressures, flows, and volume unloading.

The hydrodynamic performance and internal flow fields in the pump are investigated by computational fluid dynamics.

The distribution of shear stress, including Reynolds shear stress, is studied and discussed. Also, special attention is given to the small clearance between the rotor and the pump shell where the reversed secondary flow is formed and can flush out the clearance to avoid the flow stagnations.

s_1215,Entailment,"Optimization and Testing: Design Optimization: Advanced optimization techniques, such as metamodel-assisted genetic algorithms, have been used to improve the design of ventricular assist devices, balancing hydraulic efficiency and hemolysis index .","A centrifugal blood pump is a common type of pump used as a left ventricular assist device in the medical industries. Therefore, the improvement of the device bio-compatibility to reduce the blood damage and to increase the efficiency has become a major challenge. In the current work, a metamodel-assisted genetic algorithm is employed to simultaneously optimize the impeller and volute geometries of a typical centrifugal blood pump. The overall shape of the base design is inspired from HeartMate3 LVAD, and the main dimensions of the base design including inlet and outlet radius, blade angle distribution, volute cross-section area distribution, etc., are designed in our laboratory. Three different scenarios are investigated using three different objective functions, i.e., (1) hydraulic efficiency, (2) pressure head, and (3) hemolysis index (HI). The results showed that the shape optimized by pump efficiency has also nearly the same level of HI as the shape optimized by HI. Hence, to reduce computation time, one can use efficiency instead of HI as an objective function. However, one must check the HI level after such optimization to see whether it is within the acceptable range of HI for such bio application.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes exactly the use of a metamodel-assisted genetic algorithm to optimize the design of a centrifugal blood pump (a type of left ventricular assist device) by adjusting impeller and volute geometries with objective functions including hydraulic efficiency and hemolysis index.

s_1217,Entailment,"Key Findings: Conflicting Information and Unpreparedness: Many women report receiving conflicting and confusing information about menopause, leading to feelings of unpreparedness and dissatisfaction with the healthcare they receive . This lack of clear and consistent information can contribute to a negative experience during menopause.","Menopause is a universal life experience, and yet there is a paucity of qualitative research giving voice to women who actually live this important life transition. Historically, menopause has been conceived as a pathological condition, and therefore, medicalized by healthcare providers. The purpose of the study was to give voice to the menopausal experiences of women. The research question was: What has your experience been with perimenopause and/or menopause? Thirteen women, meeting inclusion criteria and obtained through snowball effect, were interviewed. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and drawings. The women interviewed repeatedly had questions and concerns regarding perimenopause, and often reported receiving conflicting and confusing information. The transition theory (Meleis, 2010) was used to understand the thematic results. Three major themes emerged: My Body, Sharing with Others: Not My Mother and Going on with Life.
[2]: Objectives: A qualitative study was performed to characterize experiences of women going through menopause, as well as to identify barriers and facilitators for participating in a lifestyle program targeting weight management during menopause. Study Design: Perimenopausal and postmenopausal Black women with a self-reported desire to lose or maintain weight during menopause participated in a total of six focus groups. Main Outcome Measures: Women were asked about their past experiences with diet, exercise, and weight management; their menopause experiences; as well as specific components and considerations for developing a lifestyle program for weight management. Thematic analysis was conducted on coded transcripts and four main themes emerged, each containing three to seven subthemes. Results: Twenty-seven Black women (age 54±4 years, BMI 35.1 ± 9.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were enrolled. Overall, women felt unprepared for the changes they experienced during menopause and had difficulty maintaining or losing weight. While women were receptive to trying different diets and exercises, they wanted a diet that was flexible with their lifestyle and exercises that considered their existing health status. Women were also interested in learning about menopause alongside other women, stating that medical professionals did not provide them with adequate information or help. Social support, accountability, and seeing results were perceived critical to achieve long-lasting behavioral change. Conclusions: Women were interested in receiving menopause information and improving their overall health as part of a lifestyle program during menopause. Associating with other women affected by menopause will allow for the creation of more sustainable lifestyle programs during menopause. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04487782.",Entailment,"justification:  
The first reference reports that women “often reported receiving conflicting and confusing information” about perimenopause and menopause. The second reference notes that women “felt unprepared for the changes they experienced during menopause” and that “medical professionals did not provide them with adequate information or help.” Together, these observations directly support the claim that conflicting and confusing information leads to feelings of unpreparedness and dissatisfaction, contributing to a negative menopause experience.

Every primary care team should have at least one nominated healthcare professional with a special interest and knowledge in menopause. All healthcare professionals with a special interest in menopause should have access to British Menopause Society Menopause Specialists for advice, support, onward referral and leadership of multidisciplinary education. With the introduction of the comprehensive British Menopause Society Principles and Practice of Menopause Care programme, the society is recognised throughout the UK as the leading provider of certificated menopause and post reproductive health education and training for healthcare professionals. Restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic have been a springboard for the British Menopause Society to bring innovations to the services provided for our membership and for healthcare professionals throughout the UK.

[6]: Background: There is abundant evidence of the affordable, life-saving interventions effective at the local primary health care level in lowand middle-income countries (LMICs). However, the understanding of how to deliver those interventions in diverse settings is limited. Primary healthcare services implementation research is needed to elucidate the contextual factors that can influence the outcomes of interventions, especially at the local level. US universities commonly collaborate with LMIC universities, communities, and health system partners for health services research but common barriers exist. Current challenges include the capacity to establish an ongoing presence in local settings in order to facilitate close collaboration and communication. The Peace Corps is an established development organization currently aligned with local health services in many LMICs and is well-positioned to facilitate research partnerships. This article explores the potential of a community- Peace Corps-academic partnership approach to conduct local primary healthcare services implementation research. Discussion: The Peace Corps is well positioned to offer insights into local contextual factors because volunteers work closely with local leaders, have extensive trust within local communities, and have an ongoing, constant, well-integrated presence. However, the Peace Corps does not routinely conduct primary healthcare services implementation research. Universities, within the United States and locally, could benefit from the established resources and trust of the Peace Corps to conduct health services implementation research to advance access to local health services and further the knowledge of real world application of local health services in a diversity of settings. The proposed partnership would consist of (1) a local community advisory board and local health system leaders, (2) Peace Corps volunteers, and (3) a US-LMIC academic institutional collaboration. Within the proposed partnership approach, the contributions of each partner are as follows: the local community and health system leadership guides the work in consideration of local priorities and context; the Peace Corps provides logistical support, community expertise, and local trust; and the academic institutions offer professional technical and public health educational and training resources and research support.

The purpose of this study was to describe and compare how healthcare providers from three countries with varied cultural and healthcare systems perceive the concept FCC by measuring attitudes, and to psychometrically identify a measure that would reflect ""family-centeredness."". Design and Methods: The Working with Families questionnaire, translated when appropriate, was used to capture participants' perceptions of caring for hospitalized children and their parents from pediatric healthcare providers in the United States, Australia and Turkey (n = 476). Results: The results indicated significantly more positive attitudes reported for working with children than parents for all countries and individual score differences across countries: the U.S. and Turkey child scores were significantly higher than Australia, whereas the U.S. and Australia parent scores were both significantly higher than Turkey. Conclusions: Perceptions of working with families were different for nurses from the three countries that call for a clearer understanding about perceptions in relation to delivery systems. Further analyses revealed FCS scores to be significantly different between nurses and physicians and significantly correlated with age, number of children and education. Practice Implications: The results of this study add to our understanding of influences on practice from different countries and healthcare systems. The FCS score may be useful to determine baseline beliefs and ascertain effectiveness of interventions designed to improve FCC implementation.
[10]: Family-centred care (FCC) is a key factor in increasing health and related system responsiveness to the needs of children and families; unfortunately, it is an unfamiliar service model in children's mental health. This critical review of the literature addresses three key questions: What are the concepts, characteristics and principles of FCC in the context of delivering mental health services to children? What are the enablers, barriers and demonstrated benefits to using a family-centred approach to care in children's mental health? And how can we facilitate moving an FCC model forward in children's mental health? A range of databases was searched for the years 2000–2011, for children ages zero to 18 years. Articles were selected for inclusion if a family-centred approach to care was articulated and the context was the intervention and treatment side of the mental healthcare system. This literature review uncovered a multiplicity of terms and concepts, all closely related to FCC. Two of the most frequently used terms in children's mental health are family centred and family focused, which have important differences, particularly in regard to how the family is viewed. Initial benefits to FCC include improved child and family management skills and function, an increased stability of living situation, improved cost-effectiveness, increased consumer and family satisfaction and improved child and family health and well-being. Significant challenges exist in evaluating FCC because of varying interpretations of its core concepts and applications. Nonetheless, a shared understanding of FCC in a children's mental health context seems possible, and examples can be found of best practices, enablers and strategies, including opportunities for innovative policy change to overcome barriers.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The claim asserts that FCC is “rarely implemented effectively” in pediatrics and that its benefits on child and family management skills and health outcomes are “largely overstated.” However, the provided references describe both empirical measures of FCC implementation (the Working with Families questionnaire studies across three countries) and documented benefits of FCC—including improved child and family management skills, better health and well-being outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and increased satisfaction. The literature review even highlights FCC as a “key factor in increasing health and related system responsiveness” and lists multiple demonstrated benefits. Thus, rather than supporting the claim’s skepticism, the references present evidence of effective implementation and real positive impacts, directly contradicting the claim.

This scaffold is essential for the optimal mechanical environment of the vocal cords, which is necessary for their proper function . Here are some key points about fibroblasts in the vocal cords:","Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts are found throughout mechanically loaded tissues, where they take primary responsibility for generating and maintaining the extracellular matrix scaffold upon which organ structure and function depends. They are thus tasked with creating the appropriate mechanical environment in which cells and tissues function optimally, and constantly adapting this environment as needed in response to changing environmental cues. To carry out these functions, fibroblasts must not only deposit and resorb the extracellular matrix, they must adhere to and sense its physical characteristics, and exert the forces necessary to shape, distort, and remodel it as desired. It is thus only through a constant reciprocal sensing and exertion of stress that fibroblasts can carry out their key functions. This introductory chapter will introduce these aspects of fibroblast stress sensing and matrix remodeling during tissue homeostasis, wound repair and fibrotic disease as a lead in to the detailed method chapters to follow on myofibroblast mechanobiology.",Entailment,"justification: The reference describes the general role of fibroblasts in all mechanically loaded tissues—namely generating and maintaining the extracellular matrix scaffold and shaping the mechanical environment—but it does not mention vocal cords or provide any tissue-specific evidence for the larynx.

Furthermore, geriatric changes in the vocal ligament can be attributed to the activities and the presence of ageing processes in fibroblasts of geriatric VF mucosa.",Misrepresentation,"justification:  
The reference reports that in newborns MF fibroblasts are stellate with small N/C ratio and well-developed rER/GA, and RS fibroblasts are oval with large N/C ratio and less-developed rER/GA—exactly as the claim states for newborns. However, for adults the reference states RS fibroblasts are spindle-shaped with a large N/C ratio and less-developed rER/GA, whereas the claim asserts that adult RS fibroblasts have “significantly more developed rER and GA” than in newborns. The reference does not support any increase in rER/GA development in adult RS cells—in fact it describes them as less developed. Finally, although the claim concludes that aging has no impact on overall fibroblast morphology, the reference explicitly notes that geriatric fibroblasts show reduced rER/GA development and attributes histological changes in fibroblasts to aging. Thus the claim conflicts with the reference.

The expression of fibrosis-related factors like TGF-β1 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) peaks early after injury and remains elevated, contributing to fibrosis .","Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve often leads to permanent vocal cord paralysis, which has a significant negative impact on the quality of life. Long-term denervation can induce laryngeal muscle fibrosis,which obstructs the muscle recovery after laryngeal reinnervation. However, the mechanisms of fibrosis remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to analyze the changes in the expression of fibrosis-related factors, including transforming growth factor-β 1 (TGF-β 1), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and α -smooth muscle actin (α -SMA) in denervated skeletal muscles using a mouse model of accessory nerve transection. Because of the small size, we used sternocleidomastoid muscles instead of laryngeal muscles for denervation experiments. Masson's trichrome staining showed that the grade of atrophy and fibrosis of muscles became more severe with time, but showed a plateau at 4 weeks after denervation, followed by a slow decrease. Quantitative assessment and immunohistochemistry showed that TGF-β 1 expression peaked at 1 week after denervation (p < 0.05) and was maintained at its high level until 4 weeks. CTGFand α -SMA-positive muscle cells were detected at 1 week after denervation, peaked at 2 weeks (p < 0.05), and remained at high levels with a subsequent slight decrease for 3-4 weeks. These results suggest that TGF-β 1 and CTGF may be involved in the process of denervated skeletal muscle fibrosis. They may induce the differentiation of myoblasts into myofibroblasts, as characterized by the activation of α -SMA. These findings may provide insights on key pathological processes in denervated skeletal muscle fibrosis and develop novel therapeutic strategies.",Entailment,"justification: The claim refers specifically to fibroblast‐mediated fibrosis after vocal fold injury, stating that TGF-β1 and CTGF expression peak early and remain elevated in that context. The reference, however, describes a mouse model of denervation‐induced fibrosis in sternocleidomastoid (skeletal) muscle, not vocal fold injury, and does not explicitly discuss fibroblast behavior in vocal folds. Although both studies measure TGF-β1 and CTGF kinetics in a fibrotic process, the tissue type, injury mechanism (denervation vs. vocal fold trauma), and cell populations (myofibroblasts in muscle vs. fibroblasts in vocal fold) differ. Because the reference does not address vocal fold injury or fibroblasts directly, it cannot verify the claim.

s_1245,Contradiction,"Controlling inflammation and ECM production is likely sufficient for preventing scar formation and promoting scarless healing, as indicated by the findings .","Objectives: Vocal fold scarring is the major cause of voice disorders after voice surgery or laryngeal trauma. The role of inflammatory factors in vocal fold wound healing and fibrosis has not been adequately investigated. Scarless wound healing has been associated with decreased inflammatory responses. To understand scar formation and develop reliable treatments, it is necessary to control extracellular matrix production and inflammation. Thus, we examined the inflammation profile and extracellular matrix production in wounded vocal folds in the acute phase of wound healing. Methods: Vocal fold stripping was performed on 30 Sprague-Dawley rats. Vocal fold tissue was collected at 5 time points (4, 8, 16, 24, and 72 hours). We examined the in vivo messenger RNA expression profile of inflammatory factors interleukin 1β, interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor a, nuclear factor κβ, transforming growth factor β, and cyclooxygenase 2, as well as hyaluronic acid synthases 1 and 2, procollagen subtypes I and III, and elastin synthase in scarred vocal folds after injury, compared to normal vocal folds, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: The inflammatory factors showed a time-dependent sequence of expression peaks, starting with interleukin 1β, nuclear factor κβ, tumor necrosis factor α (4 and 8 hours), and transforming growth factor β (72 hours). Interferon γ decreased at 24 hours. Correspondingly, hyaluronic acid synthase 1 expression peaked first (4 and 8 hours), whereas hyaluronic acid synthase 2 expression peaked at 16 hours and again at 72 hours. Procollagen I expression peaked at 72 hours, whereas procollagen III decreased from 8 to 16 hours but peaked at 72 hours. Cyclooxygenase 2 expression was elevated, whereas elastin expression remained constant.

We characterize a healthy state coculture model, created by using bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells and immortalized vocal fold fibroblasts. We also demonstrate that this model can be induced into a fibroplastic state to overexpress stress fibers using TGFβ1. Study Design: In vitro. Methods: Cell metabolic activity of immortalized human vocal fold fibroblasts incubated in different medium combinations was confirmed with an MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Fibroblasts were grown to confluence, and primary bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells suspended in coculture medium were seeded directly over the base layer of the fibroblasts. Cells were treated with transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) to induce myofibroblast formation. Cell shape and position were confirmed by live cell tracking, fibrosis was confirmed by probing for α smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and phenotype was confirmed by immunostaining for vimentin and E-cadherin. Results: Fibroblasts retain metabolic activity in coculture epithelial medium. Live cell imaging revealed a layer of epithelial cells atop fibroblasts. αSMA expression was enhanced in TGFβ1-treated cells, confirming that both cell types maintained a healthy phenotype in coculture, and can be induced into overexpressing stress fibers. Vimentin and E-cadherin immunostaining show that cells retain phenotype in coculture.

s_1247,Entailment,"Resistance Test: A resistance test generally refers to a procedure used to determine the resistance of an organism, such as bacteria or viruses, to a particular drug or treatment. This type of test is often used in clinical settings to guide treatment decisions. For example: Phenotypic Resistance Tests: These tests measure the growth of an organism in the presence of a drug to determine if it is resistant. An example is the plaque reduction assay (PRA) used for detecting drug resistance in Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) .","Background Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) drug resistance is a significant public health concern among immunocompromised individuals. Phenotypic assays are considered the gold standard method for detecting HSV drug resistance. However, plaque reduction assays (PRAs) are technically demanding, often with long turnaround times of up to four weeks. In contrast, genotypic tests can be performed within a few days. Objectives The development and coordination of the first European External Quality Assessment (EQA) study to evaluate phenotypic and genotypic methods used for HSV drug resistance testing in specialised reference laboratories. Study design Four HSV-1 or HSV-2 strains with different antiviral susceptibility profiles were isolated from clinical samples. Isolates were quantified by qPCR, and aliquoted in culture medium. One isolate was distributed at two dilutions to help assess assay sensitivity. The panel was distributed to five European centres with a six-week deadline for the return of phenotypic and genotypic results, together with clinical reports. Results Four out of five participating labs returned results by the deadline. Limited results were later available from the fifth lab. Phenotypic and genotypic data were largely, but not completely, concordant. An unusual resistance profile shown by one of the samples was explained by the detection of a mixed virus population after extensive further investigation by one of the centres. Conclusions Discordant clinical outputs reflecting the diversity of phenotypic methodologies demonstrated the utility of this exercise. With emerging genotypic technologies looking to supplant phenotyping, there is a need for curated public databases, accessible interpretation tools and standardised control materials for quality management. By establishing a network of testing laboratories, we hope that this EQA scheme will facilitate ongoing progress in this area.",Entailment,"justification: The claim describes what a resistance test is, highlights phenotypic resistance tests measuring organism growth in the presence of a drug, and cites the plaque reduction assay (PRA) for HSV as an example. The reference specifically discusses HSV drug resistance testing, states that phenotypic assays (notably PRAs) are the gold standard method for detecting HSV drug resistance, and details their use and turnaround time in clinical laboratory settings. This directly supports the claim’s description of PRAs as phenotypic resistance tests for HSV. Therefore, the reference entails the claim.

s_1249,Contradiction,"For instance, the HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping assay fails to identify mutations in the virus's genome that confer resistance to antiretroviral drugs .","Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) drug resistance genotyping assay is a part of clinical management of HIV-1 positive individuals under treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Routine monitoring of drug resistance mutations in resource limited settings like India is not possible due to high cost of commercial drug resistance assays. In this study we developed an in-house, cost effective HIV-1 drug resistance genotyping assay for Indian patients and validated it against the US-FDA-approved ViroSeq HIV-1 drug resistance testing system. A reference panel of 20 clinical samples was used to develop and validate the assay against ViroSeq HIV-1 drug resistance testing system which was subsequently used to genotype a clinical panel of 225 samples. The Stanford HIV database was used to identify drug resistant mutations. The analytical sensitivity of the assay was 1000 HIV-1 RNA copies/ml of plasma sample while precision and reproducibility was 99.68±0.16% and 99.76±0.18% respectively. One hundred and one drug resistant mutations were detected by the in-house assay compared to 104 by ViroSeq system in the reference panel.

While urban residents generally have better access to healthcare and improved health outcomes compared to rural populations, the benefits are often unevenly distributed. The urban poor may experience worse health outcomes due to inadequate access to healthcare and poor living conditions .","[1] Quantifying the relationship between urbanization and public health is essential to understanding the impact of the urbanization process on environment and public health. However, there are few data linking features of cities to the public health. We apply a statistical frame to explore the feature of urbanization that affects public and environment health. Then the night light data are adopted to reveal the urbanization process in China from 1992 to 2012. The development of small cities dominated the process of urbanization in China from 1992 to 2002, and large, middle and small cities develop dominantly from 2002 to 2012. There is negative relation between the proportion of night light value above 5 and the birthrate and natural increase rates. The intensity of night light has a positive relation with health index for the elder population (age >60), cancer rate and land surface temperature, but urbanization reduces the positive relation between night light and cancer rate. There is no relation between night light intensity and mortality. The important factors of urbanization affect public health can be considered from social policy (inequality? economy, education, medical resources and insurance system) and the physical environment (air, water, soil, green space, waste, food safety and urban planning). [5] Since the launch of the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology 100 years ago, the percentage of the world's population living in urban settings has more than tripled and is now approaching 50%. Urbanization will continue at a high pace, particularly in the less developed regions of Africa and Asia. The profound demographic, ecological and socio-economic transformations that accompany the process of urbanization have important impacts on health and well-being. In industrialized countries, urbanization led to the so-called 'epidemiological transition', from acute infectious and deficiency diseases to chronic non-communicable diseases, many decades ago. In the developing world, surprisingly little research has been carried out on the health-related aspects of urbanization. In a temporal analysis of publications in the Annals of Tropical Medicine and Parasitology, for example, in which the first volume in every decade from 1907 was examined, only 16 (2.6%) of the 604 articles investigated focused on epidemiological and/or public-health issues in urban tropical settings. This review begins with the question 'what is urban?' and then provides a summary of the trends seen in urbanization, and its impacts on human health, over the past century, on both a global and regional scale. For the main tropical diseases, estimates of the at-risk populations and the numbers of cases are updated and then split into urban and non-urban categories. The inhabitants of urban slums are particularly vulnerable to many of these diseases and require special attention if internationally-set targets for development are to be met. Heterogeneity, a major feature of urban settings in the tropics that complicates all efforts at health improvement, is demonstrated in an exploration of a densely populated municipality of a large West African town. Urban planners, public-health experts and other relevant stakeholders clearly need to make much more progress in alleviating poverty and enhancing the health and well-being of urban residents, in an equity-effective and sustainable manner. © 2006 The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. [9] Urbanization is the most dramatic human form of environmental transformation, resulting in widespread changes to the structure and functioning of ecosystems including those of agricultural systems (Seto et al., 2012). Urbanization has several impacts on agricultural systems. As discussed elsewhere in this volume (see Murray et al., Chapter 2 in this volume), urbanization has direct impacts on the conversion and loss of agricultural land. Urbanization also exerts indirect impacts on agricultural systems. Changes in urban diet put additional pressure on agricultural systems and rural-urban migration, driven by better economic and employment opportunities leads to agricultural land abandonment.",Entailment,"justification: The reference discusses variability in urban health outcomes—highlighting factors like social inequality and noting that slum dwellers are especially vulnerable—but it does not state that urban residents overall have better access to healthcare or generally improved health outcomes compared to rural populations.

Methods: A blinded randomized clinical trial was carried out with 58 children aged 12 to 59 months included in the Programa Governamental de Combate a Carências Nutricionais (National Child Nutritional Program), which provided them with 2 kg of iron-fortified milk. The supplementation group (n = 28) received 10 mg/day of zinc sulfate for four months, and the control group (n = 30) received placebo. The following parameters were used to assess the nutritional status: weight-for-height and height-for-age expressed as z scores, according to National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) standards, biochemical measurements of serum iron and serum zinc, and hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Results: Zinc supplementation did not have a remarkable influence on anthropometric parameters. Baseline serum zinc levels were low in both groups. After supplementation, variations in mean hemoglobin (p = 0.002), hematocrit (p = 0.001), serum zinc (p = 0.023), and serum iron (p = 0.013) levels significantly increased in the zinc supplementation group.

[2]: Zinc supplementation trials carried out among children have produced variable results, depending on the specific outcomes considered and the initial characteristics of the children who were enrolled. We completed a series of meta-analyses to examine the impact of preventive zinc supplementation on morbidity; mortality; physical growth; biochemical indicators of zinc, iron, and copper status; and indicators of behavioral development, along with possible modifying effects of the intervention results. Zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of diarrhea by ∼20%, but the impact was limited to studies that enrolled children with a mean initial age greater than 12 months. Among the subset of studies that enrolled children with mean initial age greater than 12 months, the relative risk of diarrhea was reduced by 27%. Zinc supplementation reduced the incidence of acute lower respiratory tract infections by ∼15%. Zinc supplementation yielded inconsistent impacts on malaria incidence, and too few trials are currently available to allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. Zinc supplementation had a marginal 6% impact on overall child mortality, but there was an 18% reduction in deaths among zinc-supplemented children older than 12 months of age. Zinc supplementation increased linear growth and weight gain by a small, but highly significant, amount. The interventions yielded a consistent, moderately large increase in mean serum zinc concentrations, and they had no significant adverse effects on indicators of iron and copper status. There were no significant effects on children's behavioral development, although the number of available studies is relatively small.

This article reviews medication errors and ADEs, introduces a medication safety paradigm for oral and maxillofacial surgery facilities, and provides practical safety initiatives that can be implemented to achieve the goal of optimal anesthesia patient care and safety.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that neglecting safety paradigms and practical initiatives in anesthesia facilities does not negatively impact patient care and safety. The reference, however, emphasizes that medication errors and adverse drug events occur precisely because the anesthesia medication process is complex, and it introduces a medication safety paradigm and practical safety initiatives as necessary measures “to achieve the goal of optimal anesthesia patient care and safety.” Implicitly, without these paradigms and initiatives, patient care and safety would be compromised. Thus, the reference directly opposes the claim.

s_1275,Contradiction,Discouraging the reporting and analysis of critical incidents and medication errors is more effective in maintaining the status quo and preventing unnecessary changes in safety protocols .,"Drug medication errors remain a major safety issue in anaesthesia and intensive care, and prevention measures need to be strengthened. This is why the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care and the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy have profoundly reviewed their previous recommendations published in 2007. The 2017 recommendations are based on the literature but also on feedback from field professionals targeting patient safety. They share many similarities with recommendations issued from other countries (European countries, North America and Australia in particular) on this subject. Specific measures to prevent preparation, reconstitution and administration errors are detailed. Medical products using small bore connectors specified in the ISO 80369 series allow the prevention of administrtion errors. Specific labeling should be used according to an international color-coding of syringes, routes of administration, preparation bags, PCAs and PCEAs, trolleys or drug storage devices. A risk mapping must be established a priori and medication errors reporting is imperative in order to analyze them a posteriori in departmental meetings (REMED). Self-assessment, or external assessment, must be conducted. All of the proposed recommendations reinforce the culture of safety, which is essential to the practice of anaesthesia and intensive care.
[9]: Patient safety in hospitals is difficult to define and is not measurable by operational safety parameters as in other fields. So-called adverse events (AE) are a collective of complications, failures, mistakes, errors and violations. Estimations of at least 9.2% AEs in surgery with 0.1% fatalities are given worldwide but there are no correlations between objective quantification of AEs and subjective or public perception of safety during the perioperative period. Patient safety during this period is mostly endangered by wound infections (safety 98%) and nosocomial infections (safety 97%). In spite of these facts, safety parameters for problems in anesthesia, blood transfusion, in retaining surgical instruments and so-called index events, such as patient and side identification errors are much higher. Patient safety is maintained in hospitals by objective means (surgical). Checklists have been proven to improve safety and critical incidence reporting, training and changing of attitudes could have further advantages but they are difficult to measure. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that discouraging the reporting and analysis of critical incidents and medication errors is effective at preserving the status quo and avoiding safety-protocol changes. Both given references, however, explicitly call for strengthening prevention measures through mandatory error reporting, retrospective analysis of incidents (REMED), risk mapping, and a reinforced culture of safety. They highlight that reporting and analysis are imperative and that tools like checklists and training further improve patient safety. Thus the claim directly conflicts with the references’ endorsement of reporting and analysis.

s_1277,Entailment,"Global and Organizational Efforts: The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) has played a pivotal role in promoting patient safety through education, research grants, and the development of safety protocols .","The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. As the first organization of its kind, the APSF established patient safety as a specific aspiration and discipline, and has been instrumental in triggering the worldwide patient safety movements of the present day. Many anesthesiologists point with pride to a tenfold decline in the incidence of anesthesia-related mortality from 10–30 to 1–3 deaths per 100,000 anesthetics since the APSF's inaugural, with reductions in anesthesia-related morbidity similarly claimed. Others contend that these data are unintentionally misleading. Introduction of noninvasive oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide and anesthetic gas concentration monitors, novel drugs and regimens, and instrumentation for airway management have made substantial contributions to improved patient safety in the interval surrounding surgery. However, new operations in new settings steadily raise new safety issues. As risks of the past are contained fresh risks have become apparent including persistent and deleterious effects of anesthetics on the nervous system at the extremes of age. Perioperative safety is profoundly influenced by corporate decision making, vicissitudes of international markets and governmental interventions that arise far from the operating room, as shortages of critical anesthetic drugs and a surfeit of awkwardly working digital recording devices attest.
[12]: The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) was created in 1985. Its founders coined the term ""patient safety"" in its modern public usage and created the very first patient safety organization, igniting a movement that is now universal in all of health care. Driven by the vision ""that no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia,"" the APSF has worked tirelessly for more than a quarter century to promote safety education and communication through its widely read Newsletter, its programs, and its presentations. The APSF's extensive research grant program has supported a great many projects leading to key safety improvements and, in particular, was central in the development of high-fidelity mannequin simulation as a research and teaching tool. With its pioneering collaboration, the APSF is unique in incorporating the talents and resources of anesthesia professionals of all types, safety scientists, pharmaceutical and equipment manufacturers, regulators, liability insurance companies, and also surgeons. Specific alerts, campaigns, discussions, and projects have targeted a host of safety issues and dangers over the years, starting with minimal intraoperative monitoring in 1986 and all the way up to beach-chair position cerebral perfusion pressure, operating room medication errors, and the extremely popular DVD on operating room fire safety in 2010; the list is long and expansive. The APSF has served as a model and inspiration for subsequent patient safety organizations and has been recognized nationally as having a dramatic positive impact on the safety of anesthesia care. Recognizing that the work is not over, that systems, organizations, and equipment still at times fail, that basic preventable human errors still do sometimes occur, and that ""production pressure"" in anesthesia practice threatens past safety gains, the APSF is firmly committed and continues to work hard both on established tenets and new patient safety principles.

[3]: Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases characterized by hyperglycemia that is due to the defects in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. The chronic hyperglycemic effects of diabetes are associated with long-term damage, dysfunction, and failure of different organs, especially the eyes, kidneys, nerves, heart, and blood vessels. Diabetes mellitus may be observed with characteristic symptoms such as thirst, polyuria, blurring of vision, and weight loss. In its most severe forms, ketoacidosis or a non-ketotic hyperosmolar state may develop leading to stupor, coma and, in absence of effective treatment, death. In the present article 20 species of medicinal and aromatic plants have been identified with antidiabetic potential obtained from the state of West Bengal has been discussed.
[4]: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin deficiency in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. It is the most common endocrine disorder and by the year 2010, it is estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide will have DM and 300 million will subsequently have the disease by 2025. As the disease progresses tissue or vascular damage ensues leading to severe diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular complications and ulceration. Thus, diabetes covers a wide range of heterogeneous diseases. Diabetes mellitus may be categorized into several types but the two major types are type 1 and type 2. Drugs are used primarily to save life and alleviate symptoms. Secondary aims are to prevent long-term diabetic complications and, by eliminating various risk factors, to increase longevity. Insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay for patients with type 1 DM while diet and lifestyle modifications are considered the cornerstone for the treatment and management of type 2 DM. Insulin is also important in type 2 DM when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise and oral medications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents are also useful in the treatment of type 2 DM. Oral hypoglycaemic agents include sulphonylureas, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinide analogues, and thiazolidenediones. The main objective of these drugs is to correct the underlying metabolic disorder, such as insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. They should be prescribed in combination with an appropriate diet and lifestyle changes. Diet and lifestyle strategies are to reduce weight, improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, which account for 70% to 80% of deaths among those with diabetes. Diabetes is best controlled either by diet alone and exercise (non-pharmacological), or diet with herbal or oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin (pharmacological). The main side effects are weight gain and hypoglycaemia with sulfonylureas, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances with metformin, weight gain, GI disturbances and liver injury with thiazolidinediones, GI disturbances, weight gain and hypersensitivity reactions with meglitinides and flatulence, diarrhoea and abdominal bloating with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim defines hyperglycemia as “persistent low blood glucose levels due to excessive insulin action or secretion.” All of the provided references, however, consistently describe hyperglycemia as elevated (high) blood glucose resulting from insulin resistance, inadequate insulin secretion, or excessive glucagon secretion.

In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus there is a substantial and chronic increase in the circulating glucose concentration. This elevation in glucose levels is accompanied by a plethora of other biochemical disturbances, including disruption of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. Clinical manifestations of diabetes, which arise from the metabolic disturbances vary between individuals but are often a serious threat to quality and length of life. Pancreas transplantation (Tx) and islet modifications are methods used to restore endogenous insulin secretion in insulin-dependent diabetic patients. In order for this to be achieved successfully, however, some of the problems such as hyperglycemia states (>150 mg/dl), which may harm pancreatic graft beta cells, immunorejection, the effects of immunosuppression, for example, must be overcome. Considering these problems, therefore, it seems logical that the replacement of the islet tissue itself, either by transplanting a vascularised pancreatic allograft or by transplanting modified pancreatic islet cells, provides a better alternative therapeutic approach than simply replacing insulin that has been lost.

[2]: Anemia is a group of diseases characterized by a decrease in either hemoglobin or packed cell volume, resulting in reduced oxygen carrying capacity of the blood. According to WHO, anemia in pregnancy is defined as Haemoglobin (Hb) less than 11gm/dl, and is divided into threedegrees-mild (10.9-9.0 gm %), moderate (8.9-7.0 gm %) and severe degree (<7.0 gm %).A Prospective observational study from August 2017 – January 2018 on anemia in pregnancy and its complications was conducted in In-patient department of gynecology and obstetrics in Gandhi Hospital.105 anemia cases were collected analyzed and results were obtained. Anemia was most prevalent in 20-29 years age groups (85%). Distribution based on severity of anemia in which 37% with mild anemia, 47% of patients with moderate anemia, and 15% with severe anemiawere diagnosed. About 95% of pregnant woman were found to have iron deficiency anemia. About 45% of new born babies were found to have low birth weight <2.5kg. Results pertaining to socioeconomic status, birth spacing and correlation between Hb and birth weight were also obtained. The study shows that the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia is high and various associated factors like lower socio-economic status, multigravida, low birth interval and non-adherence towards iron therapy significantly contributes to the development of anemia. Our study suggests that maternal anemia increases the risks of maternal and neonatal complications like pre term delivery, intrauterine death, intra uterine growth retardation and the low birth weight of babies which has direct correlation with Hb concentration.

Furthermore, iron deficiency anemia (IDA) accounts for 50% of cases of anemia. IDA is common during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and can lead to serious maternal and fetal complications. The aim of this report was to present the experiences of a multidisciplinary expert group, and to establish reference guidelines for the optimal diagnosis and treatment of IDA during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Studies and guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of IDA published in Turkish and international journals were reviewed. Conclusive recommendations were made by an expert panel aiming for a scientific consensus.

The lower threshold value for hemoglobin (Hb) in pregnant women is <11 g/dL during the 1st and 3rd trimesters, and <10.5 g/dL during the 2nd trimester. In postpartum period a Hb concentration <10 g/dL indicates clinically significant anemia. Oral iron therapy is given as the first-line treatment for IDA. Although current data are limited, intravenous (IV) iron therapy is an alternative therapeutic option in patients who do not respond to oral iron therapy, have adverse reactions, do not comply with oral iron treatment, have a very low Hb concentration, and require rapid iron repletion. IV iron preparations can be safely used for the treatment of IDA during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and are more beneficial than oral iron preparations in specific indications.",Numeric error,"justification: The reference specifies that anemia in pregnant women is defined by hemoglobin levels below 11 g/dL in the first and third trimesters and below 10.5 g/dL in the second trimester.

[7]: Pregnancy-associated primary red cell aplasia (pPRCA) is a rare disorder that may occur at various time points during pregnancy. Unlike pregnancy-associated aplastic anemia, pPRCA is usually reversible, and no maternal deaths attributable to pPRCA have been reported. Herein, we report a woman diagnosed with pPRCA in two consecutive pregnancies. Corticosteroids were found to be ineffective, and she required a large number of red blood cell transfusions during both pregnancies. Despite severe anemia developing in both pregnancies, two healthy babies were vaginally born and spontaneous remission of pPRCA was seen after delivery. Interestingly, in both events of pPRCA described here, a transient rise of reticulocytes was observed precedent to the authentic recovery phase of reticulocytes and remission of pPRCA, which is a novel finding that has not been reported. The significance of this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated. Along with this case report, we review all 15 cases with 21 events of pPRCA in the literature, including the present case.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that aplastic anemia is “common and mild” and “often resolves without the need for transfusions.” The reference explicitly describes aplastic anemia as “a rare, morbid cause of anemia of pregnancy” that is “managed with transfusions until the completion of pregnancy.” This directly contradicts the claim’s characterization of aplastic anemia as common, mild, and often not requiring transfusions.

This suggests that discomfort in the ankle could be related to issues in the hip joint through a common mechanism affecting the lower back.","Study Design. Cross-sectional survey. Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between self-reported low back symptoms and symptoms in the hip, knee, and ankle in a high-risk occupational group. Summary of Background Data. Low back pain, with or without lower extremity referral, poses a major challenge to occupational productivity, especially in farming. Although low back symptoms can occur independent of lower extremity symptoms, anatomical positioning of nerves supplying the lower limbs means structural and physiological changes in the spine can lead to referred pain in the lower limbs, but the magnitude of the association between low back and lower extremity symptoms is unclear. Methods. Baseline postal questionnaire data from the Saskatchewan Farm Injury Cohort Study yielded surveys from 2653 adults from 1020 farms, who responded to Standardized Nordic Questionnaire (SNQ) items on ""ache, pain, discomfort"" in nine body parts during the last 12 months. Bivariate and multivariate regression modeling was performed with low back symptoms as the outcome and lower extremity symptoms as the independent variable. Results. After adjustment for age, sex, depression, and heavy lifting, low back symptom was significantly related with hip pain (odds ratio [OR] = 3.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.04-4.84), knee pain (OR = 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.28), and ankle pain (OR = 1.79, 95% CI 1.40-2.29). Results showed a significant but decreasing relationship to low back symptoms as sites became more distal. Conclusion. Hip and low back symptoms are highly associated, suggesting a common mechanism may be at work. Although there appears be increased risk of knee and ankle region symptoms among those with back pain, the SNQ is not designed to differentiate types of referred symptoms (i.e., numbness, tingling, shooting pain) and/or clinical diagnoses. Other tools, possibly corroborated with clinical examination findings, are likely necessary for a more thorough investigation of referred pain patterns in this high-risk occupational group.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference reports exactly the associations and odds ratios between low back symptoms and hip (OR=3.84), knee (OR=1.84), and ankle (OR=1.79) pain, confirming the significant relationships stated in the claim.

This highlights how chronic conditions affecting the ankle can impact overall lower limb function, including the hip. Furthermore, it is plausible that interventions aimed at improving ankle mobility could also enhance psychological well-being in women with fibromyalgia, although this remains to be investigated.","Background Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain condition, which involves reduced range of motion. This leads to gait changes and high incidence of falls. The understanding of the gait patterns in subjects with fibromyalgia and their relationship with falls may be useful when designing intervention programs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the range of motion of the hip and ankle joints during gait in women with and without fibromyalgia. Further, we determined the relationship between joint range of motion and falls in this population. Methods Middle-aged women (16 with fibromyalgia and 16 as control group) were recruited. Pain intensity, physical activity level, and fall prevalence were assessed. Three dimensional gait analysis provided temporal and joint kinematic variables. Findings In general, hip and ankle range of motion were similar between groups, except that fibromyalgia group showed higher plantar flexion during toe-off (P < 0.05) and reduced dorsiflexion during stance phase (P < 0.05). Additionally, in the fibromyalgia group the higher number of falls was correlated to reduced dorsiflexion during stance phase. This limitation in dorsiflexion was related to longer length of time with fibromyalgia symptoms. Interpretation Women with fibromyalgia showed a higher number of falls, reduced dorsiflexion during stance phase, and increased plantar flexion during toe-off. Also, the higher number of falls reported in the fibromyalgia group was related to reduced dorsiflexion during stance phase, which was correlated to a longer length of time living with fibromyalgia symptoms. These data suggest that improving ankle kinematics in patients with fibromyalgia may help prevent falls and improve mobility.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference directly reports that women with fibromyalgia have reduced dorsiflexion during stance, increased plantar flexion at toe-off, and that reduced dorsiflexion is correlated both with higher fall incidence and with longer symptom duration—fully supporting the first part of the claim.

BACKGROUND: Altered lower extremity movement pattern consisting of excessive femoral adduction and internal rotation, leading to excessive knee valgus alignment, is associated with increased risk of knee ligament injury, as well as patellofemoral pain syndrome. Previous investigations of lower extremity kinematics, using 3-dimensional motion analysis systems, document an inconsistent association between hip muscle strength and lower extremity movement pattern. Currently, it is unknown whether differences in hip muscle strength or other physical measures exist among women with differing quality of lower extremity movement as assessed by visual observation. METHODS: Two physical therapists assessed the quality of movement during the lateral step-down among 29 healthy women (mean ± SD age, 24.3 ± 3.2 years). Subjects were instructed on the optimal movement pattern prior to performing the test. The quality of movement was categorized as ""good"" or ""moderate,"" based on a previously established 6-point scale. Several measures of hip strength (handheld dynamometer) and hip and ankle range of motion (fluid-filled inclinometer and universal goniometer) were also assessed. Differences in strength and range-of-motion measures between women with good and women with moderate quality of movement were assessed with a Mann-Whitney U test. RESULTS: Both examiners found decreased ankle dorsiflexion range of motion, as measured with the knee bent (P<.05 and P<.01 for examiner 1 and 2, respectively) and in weight bearing (P<.001 and P<.01 for examiner 1 and 2, respectively) among women with a moderate quality of movement compared to women with a good quality of movement on the lateral step-down test. CONCLUSION: Following receipt of instructions on optimal lower extremity movement pattern, women who demonstrate a moderate quality of movement, as assessed visually during the lateral step-down test, exhibit decreased ankle dorsiflexion range of motion compared to women with a good quality of movement. Clinicians should consider evaluating ankle dorsiflexion range of motion when observing an altered lower extremity movement pattern during the lateral step-down test.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The study directly compares women with “good” versus “moderate” quality of lower‐extremity movement (as assessed visually by observing hip, knee, and ankle alignment during the lateral step‐down). It reports that those with poorer (moderate) movement quality exhibited significantly decreased ankle dorsiflexion range of motion. The paper’s background and testing method make clear that “quality of movement” encompasses hip position (excessive femoral adduction/internal rotation), so the finding supports the notion that limited ankle mobility is associated with–and thus may influence–movement patterns of the entire lower limb, including the hip.

Mechanical strain on the hip can result from varus malalignment of the foot. This study was undertaken to explore the cross-sectional relationship between varus foot alignment and hip conditions in a population of older adults. Methods. The Framingham Osteoarthritis Study cohort consists of a population-based sample of older adults. Within this sample, we measured forefoot and rearfoot frontal plane alignment using photographs of a non-weight-bearing view of both feet of 385 men and women (mean age 63.1 years). Each foot segment was categorized according to the distribution of forefoot and rearfoot alignment among cases of ipsilateral hip pain, trochanter tenderness, hip pain or tenderness, and total hip replacement (THR). The relationship of foot alignment to these conditions was examined using logistic regression and generalized estimating equations, adjusting for age, body mass index, sex, and physical activity. Results. The mean ± SD rearfoot varus alignment was 0.7 ± 5.5 degrees, and the mean ± SD forefoot varus alignment was 9.9 ± 9.9 degrees. Subjects in the highest category of forefoot varus alignment had 1.8 times the odds of having ipsilateral hip pain (P for trend = 0.06), 1.9 times the odds of having hip pain or tenderness (P for trend < 0.01), and 5.1 times the odds of having undergone THR (P for trend = 0.04) compared with those in the lowest category.

It has been validated in clinical trial populations and shows significant differences among severity groups, indicating its utility in assessing symptom severity, including bloating.","Background: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the newly developed seven-item Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) Daily Symptom Diary and four-item Event Log using phase II clinical trial safety and efficacy data in patients with IBS-D. This instrument measures diarrhea (stool frequency and stool consistency), abdominal pain related to IBS-D (stomach pain, abdominal pain, abdominal cramps), immediate need to have a bowel movement (immediate need and accident occurrence), bloating, pressure, gas, and incomplete evacuation. Methods: Psychometric properties and responsiveness of the instrument were evaluated in a clinical trial population [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01494233]. Results: A total of 434 patients were included in the analyses. Significant differences were found among severity groups (p < 0.01) defined by IBS Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI-S) and IBS Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C). Severity scores for each Diary and Event Log item score and five-item, four-item, and three-item summary scores were calculated. Between-group differences in changes over time were significant for all summary scores in groups stratified by changes in PGI-S (p < 0.05), two of six Diary items, and three of four Event Log items; a one-grade change in PGI-S was considered a meaningful difference with mean change scores on all Diary items '0.13 to '0.86 [standard deviation (SD) 0.79-1.39]. Similarly, for patients who reported being 'slightly improved' (considered a clinically meaningful difference) on the PGI-C, mean change scores on Diary items ranged from '0.45 to '1.55 (SD 0.69-1.39). All estimates of clinically important change for each item and all summary scores were small and should be considered preliminary. These results are aligned with the previous standalone psychometric study regarding reliability and validity tests.

Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs): The PAN-PROMISE scale, developed for acute pancreatitis, includes items based on symptoms causing the most discomfort, which could potentially include bloating. This scale has been validated for reliability and responsiveness .","Objective This study aimed to develop and validate a patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) in acute pancreatitis (AP) as an endpoint centred on the patient. Design A PROM instrument (PAtieNt-rePoRted OutcoMe scale in acute pancreatItis, an international proSpEctive cohort study, PAN-PROMISE scale) was designed based on the opinion of patients, professionals and an expert panel. The scale was validated in an international multicentre prospective cohort study, describing the severity of AP and quality of life at 15 days after discharge as the main variables for validation. The COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments) methodology was applied. Both the design and validation stages considered the content and face validity of this new instrument; the metric properties of the different items, reliability (reproducibility and internal consistence), the construct, structural and criterion validity, responsiveness and interpretability of this scale. Results PAN-PROMISE consists of a seven-item scale based on the symptoms that cause the most discomfort and concern to patients with AP. The validation cohort involved 15 countries, 524 patients. The intensity of symptoms changed from higher values during the first 24 hours to lower values at discharge and 15 days thereafter. Items converged into a unidimensional ordinal scale with good fit indices. Internal consistency and split-half reliability at discharge were adequate. Reproducibility was confirmed using test-retest reliability and comparing the PAN-PROMISE score at discharge and 15 days after discharge. Evidence is also provided for the convergent-discriminant and empirical validity of the scale. Conclusion The PAN-PROMISE scale is a useful tool to be used as an endpoint in clinical trials, and to quantify patient well-being during the hospital admission and follow-up. Trial registration number NCT03650062",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference describes the PAN-PROMISE scale as a seven-item instrument “based on the symptoms that cause the most discomfort and concern to patients with AP,” and confirms its validation—including reliability (reproducibility and internal consistency) and responsiveness. This supports the claim that the scale is symptom-based and has been validated for reliability and responsiveness. However, the reference does not specify which symptoms are included (it does not mention bloating), so the assertion that the scale “could potentially include bloating” cannot be verified from the given text.

s_1327,Unverifiable,"Key Points: Influence of Pathologies: Certain medical conditions can alter the pH of sweat. For example, cystic fibrosis (CF) is known to increase chloride levels in sweat, which can also affect the pH. Sweat tests for CF often measure chloride concentration, but pH can be an additional parameter to consider .","Although sweat conductivity values are well matched with chloride concentrations for cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis, sweat conductivity is not accepted as a definitive diagnostic tool but only a screening method. The aim of this study was to compare the sweat chloride measurements and sweat conductivity values of our patients, and to determine cut-off values of conductivity for making or excluding a CF diagnosis. Fifty-nine CF patients, 10 patients with elevated sweat tests and 69 non-CF patients were included in the study. The mean conductivity values were 123 (64-157) mmol/L, 75.1 (60-93) mmol/L and 39 (18-83) mmol/L in the CF, elevated sweat test and control groups, respectively. The mean chloride concentration values were 107.5 (35-166) mEq/L, 48 (42-76) mEq/L and 25 (11-39) mEq/L in the CF, elevated sweat test and control groups, respectively. Spearman correlation test determined a strong correlation between conductivity and chloride concentration values (r=88%, p<0.001) in all subjects. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve graph, the best conductivity cut-off value to make the CF diagnosis was found to be 90 mmol/L and to exclude the CF diagnosis was 70 mmol/L. We suggest that the conductivity measurement is as reliable as quantitative sweat chloride analysis to diagnose or exclude CF, and it can be used as a diagnostic test in addition to screening.
[4]: Background: Sweat chloride test is the gold standard test for cystic fibrosis (CF) diagnosis. Sweat conductivity is widely used although still considered a screening test. Methods: This was a prospective, cross-sectional, diagnostic research conducted at the laboratory of the Instituto da Criança of the Hospital das Clínicas, São Paulo, Brazil. Sweat chloride (quantitative pilocarpine iontophoresis) and sweat conductivity tests were simultaneously performed in patients referred for a sweat test between March 2007 and October 2008. Conductivity and chloride cut-off values used to rule out or diagnose CF were < 75 and ≥ 90 mmol/L and < 60 and ≥ 60 mmol/L, respectively. The ROC curve method was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), as well as the respective 95% confidence intervals and to calculate the area under the curve for both tests. The kappa coefficient was used to evaluate agreement between the tests. Results: Both tests were performed in 738 children, and CF was ruled out in 714 subjects; the median sweat chloride and conductivity values were 11 and 25. mmol/L in these populations, respectively. Twenty-four patients who had received a diagnosis of CF presented median sweat chloride and conductivity values of 87 and 103. mmol/L, respectively. Conductivity values above 90. mmol/L had 83.3% sensitivity, 99.7% specificity, 90.9% PPV and 99.4% NPV to diagnose CF. The best conductivity cut-off value to exclude CF was < 75. mmol/L. Good agreement was observed between the tests (kappa: 0.934). Conclusions: The sweat conductivity test yielded a high degree of diagnostic accuracy and it showed good agreement with sweat chloride. We suggest that it should play a role as a diagnostic test for CF in the near future.
[5]: Background : Cystic fibrosis is a chronic progressive autosomal recessive disorder caused by the CFTR gene mutations. It is quite common in Caucasians, but very rare in Asians. Sweat chloride test is known to be a screening test for the cystic fibrosis due to the fact that electrolyte levels in sweat are elevated in patients. In this study, sweat chloride levels in Korean population were measured and analyzed by using standardized pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat chloride test. Methods : The sweat chloride test was performed in 47 patients referred to Yondong Severance Hospital from August, 2001 to April, 2007 and 41 healthy volunteers. The sweat chloride tests were conducted according to the CLSI C34-A2 guideline using pilocarpine iontophoresis method, and the chloride concentrations in sweat were measured by mercurimetric titration. Results : Four patients showed sweat chloride concentrations higher than 60 mmol/L. Reference interval was calculated as 1.4-44.5 mmol/L by analysis of the results of healthy volunteers (n=41). Four patients who exhibited high sweat chloride levels, had characteristic clinical features of cystic fibrosis and their diagnoses were confirmed either by repeated sweat chloride test or genetic analysis. Conclusions : Standardized sweat chloride test can be utilized as a useful diagnostic tool for cystic fibrosis in Koreans. In cases of sweat chloride levels higher than 40 mmol/L, the test should be repeated for the possible diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. All the confirmed Korean cases of cystic fibrosis showed sweat chloride level above 60 mmol/L.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference discusses sweat chloride concentrations and sweat conductivity measurements for diagnosing cystic fibrosis, but it does not mention sweat pH or how CF affects pH.

Anthocyanin (Ac) can be extracted from Brassica oleracea var. capitata f. rubra using a simple procedure. Then, it can be used as a direct dye into cotton fibers using potash alum as mordant (M) to fix the anthocyanin dye onto the surface of the cotton fabric (Cot). This was monitored by generating mordant/anthocyanin nanoparticles (MAcNPs) onto the fabric surface. The cotton sensor assay demonstrated colorimetric changes in the ultraviolet-visible absorbance spectral analysis associated with a blueshift from 588 to 422 nm with increasing the pH of a perspiration simulant fluid. The biochromic performance of the dyed cotton diagnostic assay depended essentially on the halochromic activity of the anthocyanin spectroscopic probe to demonstrate a color change from pink to green due to intramolecular charge transfer occurring on the anthocyanin chromophore. After dyeing, no significant defects were detected in air-permeability and bend length. High colorfastness was investigated for the dyed cotton fabrics.
[6]: There has been a growing interest in sweat-based sensors in the past several decades as eccrine sweat contains many metabolites of physiological significance. In particular, perspiration sensing is important not only for wellness monitoring and performance analysis, but also replenishment of metabolically significant ions and metabolites such as Na<sup>+</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup> K<sup>+</sup>, and glucose. This study aims to develop a technology for a miniaturized and wearable system for perspiration monitoring by integrating serpentine-shaped interdigitated electrodes as an impedance sensor interfaced with a flexible low-power circuit system. In this paper, we demonstrated that the wearable perspiration system could track the changes of impedance of a simulated sweat solution as close to a benchtop potentiostat. This wearable system holds a significant potential for performance, wellness and health tracking.
[7]: The body naturally and continuously secretes sweat for thermoregulation during sedentary and routine activities at rates that can reflect underlying health conditions, including nerve damage, autonomic and metabolic disorders, and chronic stress. However, low secretion rates and evaporation pose challenges for collecting resting thermoregulatory sweat for non-invasive analysis of body physiology. Here we present wearable patches for continuous sweat monitoring at rest, using microfluidics to combat evaporation and enable selective monitoring of secretion rate. We integrate hydrophilic fillers for rapid sweat uptake into the sensing channel, reducing required sweat accumulation time towards real-time measurement. Along with sweat rate sensors, we integrate electrochemical sensors for pH, Cl<sup>−</sup>, and levodopa monitoring. We demonstrate patch functionality for dynamic sweat analysis related to routine activities, stress events, hypoglycemia-induced sweating, and Parkinson's disease. By enabling sweat analysis compatible with sedentary, routine, and daily activities, these patches enable continuous, autonomous monitoring of body physiology at rest.",Related but unverifiable,"justification: The reference [7] clearly describes wearable patches capable of continuous sweat monitoring at rest, including electrochemical pH sensors, and demonstrates their use for tracking physiological changes and diagnosing conditions such as stress events and disease markers.

[2]: Omalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds circulating IgE antibody, is a treatment option for patients with moderate to severe allergic asthma whose asthma is poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and inhaled long-acting β2 agonist bronchodilators. This review considers the mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety and place in management of omalizumab in asthma and focuses particularly on key articles published over the last three years. Omalizumab reduces IgE mediated airway inflammation and its effect on airway remodeling is under investigation. Recent long-term clinical trials confirm the benefits of omalizumab in reducing exacerbations and symptoms in adults and in children with moderate to severe allergic asthma. No clinical or immunological factor consistently predicts a good therapeutic response to omalizumab in allergic asthma. In responders, the duration of treatment is unclear. The main adverse effect of omalizumab is anaphylaxis, although this occurs infrequently. Preliminary data from a five-year safety study has raised concerns about increased cardiovascular events and a final report is awaited. Clinical trials are in progress to determine whether omalizumab has efficacy in the treatment of non-allergic asthma. © the author(s), publisher and licensee Libertas Academica Ltd.

Material and methods: Participants were seen in the clinic at enrollment (visit 1), after 16 weeks (visit 2), after 52 weeks (visit 3) and after 104 weeks (visit 4) of treatment with omalizumab. We evaluated lung function, ICS use and the quality of life with the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (PAQLQ) and the Pediatric Asthma Caregiver's Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ). Results: Nineteen children and caregivers were enrolled. Signifcant improvement was observed in PAQLQ and PACQLQ scores, both in all domains and in total scores. Signifcant differences were found between the frst and the other visits. A positive correlation between PAQLQ and PACQLQ at the frst and at the second visit was found, 63.3% of patients achieved reduction in ICS doses. We did not notice any signifcant improvement in FEV<inf>1</inf>.

s_1335,Entailment,"2.  -  Targets IL-5, reducing eosinophil levels and associated inflammation .","[8] Nonresponders to maximal guideline-based therapies of asthma account for most of the morbidity, mortality, and economic burden of the disease. Because eosinophils are key effector cells in asthmatic airway inflammation, blocking IL-5, the main cytokine responsible for its survival and activation, seems to be a rational strategy. While previous monoclonal antibodies against the IL-5 ligand resulted in inconsistent improvements in asthma outcomes, benralizumab has shown promise. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 receptor, and has an enhanced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function. In this article, we review the theoretical advantages of benralizumab compared to previous compounds, as well as current status of the clinical development of benralizumab in asthma. Lastly, we briefly discuss the potential role of benralizumab in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. [16] PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Allergic rhinitis and asthma are some of the most prevalent chronic diseases in children. Meticulous evaluations of the therapeutic options and interventions are needed to control this burden. The central pathogenic mechanism is an immediate hypersensitivity reaction, followed by interventions in the allergic cascade. Once inflammation is established, potent anti-inflammatory agents or mediator antagonists could help control the phenomenon and reduce the characteristic symptoms related to severity. RECENT FINDINGS: Monoclonal antibody against IgE has demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the symptoms of asthma and rhinitis. In difficult-to-treat asthma patients it allows a reduction in the dose of inhaled steroids, the number of exacerbations, emergency visits and hospitalizations. Its broad implementation is limited by its high cost because adverse events are not a concern. Specific sublingual immunotherapy gave promising results in clinical trials, while modifying immunoglobulins and cytokine profiles, also inducing T-cell tolerance. Safety issues of subcutaneous immunotherapy have been surpassed by the sublingual route, with equivalent efficacy. The new inhaled steroid ciclesonide is effective in established inflammation, is activated only in the respiratory system, and has negligible systemic effects.

These treatments offer significant benefits in terms of symptom control, reduction in exacerbations, and improved quality of life, with generally favorable safety profiles. However, the choice of therapy should be tailored to the individual patient's phenotype and response to treatment .","Asthma is a multifaceted disease and is associated with significant impairment and risk, and a therapeutic response that is highly variable. Although current treatments are usually effective for patients with mild-to-moderate disease, patients with more severe asthma are often unresponsive to current efforts, and there remains a need for agents with properties that may achieve control in these individuals. There is ongoing research to identify bioactive molecules that contribute to the pathophysiology of asthma, and many of these have been identified as potential therapeutic targets to improve control of this disease. As a consequence of these efforts, monoclonal antibodies have been developed and tested as to their effectiveness in the treatment of asthma. The assessment of these new treatments has identified particular pathways that, in selected patients, have shown benefit. The following review will discuss the current and future use of biological agents for the treatment of asthma, their efficacy, and how certain patient phenotypes and endotypes may be associated with biomarkers that may be used to select treatments to achieve greatest effectiveness of their use. As knowledge of the effects of these biological agents in asthma emerges, as well as the patients in whom they are most beneficial, the movement toward personalized treatment will follow.
[11]: Severe asthma comprises several heterogeneous phenotypes, underpinned by complex pathomechanisms known as endotypes. The latter are driven by intercellular networks mediated by molecular components which can be targeted by specific monoclonal antibodies. With regard to the biological treatments of either allergic or non-allergic eosinophilic type 2 asthma, currently available antibodies are directed against immunoglobulins E (IgE), interleukin-5 (IL-5) and its receptor, the receptors of interleukins-4 (IL-4) and 13 (IL-13), as well as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and other alarmins. Among these therapeutic strategies, the best choice should be made according to the phenotypic/endotypic features of each patient with severe asthma, who can thus respond with significant clinical and functional improvements. Conversely, very poor options so far characterize the experimental pipelines referring to the perspective biological management of non-type 2 severe asthma, which thereby needs to be the focus of future thorough research.
[12]: Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease. Most patients respond to current standard of care, i.e., bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs, but in some adequate asthma control cannot be achieved with standard treatments. These difficult-to-treat patients would be the target population for new biological therapies. At present, omalizumab is the only biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation. Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies on larger groups of patients are needed to confirm their safety and efficacy.",Entailment,"justification:  
The reference describes how severe asthma is heterogeneous and how monoclonal antibodies targeting IgE, IL-5, IL-4/IL-13, and other pathways have been developed and tested.

It also states that omalizumab is safe and well tolerated and that therapy choice should be based on individual phenotypic/endotypic features. These points directly support the claim that monoclonal antibodies are a promising, phenotype-tailored option for severe asthma, offering symptom and quality-of-life benefits with generally favorable safety.

s_1349,Contradiction,"Gender differences in functional outcomes are significant across all subtypes of ischemic stroke, suggesting that women may never fully recover compared to men .","Objective: Recent studies have demonstrated gender differences in functional outcome after stroke. However, the underlying reasons for differences have been inconsistent. The present study examined whether gender differences in long-term functional outcomes exist among surviving patients with first-ever ischemic stroke and with individual subtypes of stroke. Methods: A total of 997 patients (654 men, 343 women) were followed for 5 years after discharge. Patients were assigned to 4 subtypes of ischemic stroke (atherothrombotic, lacunar, cardioembolic and unclassified infarction). Functional outcomes were expressed as locomotor activity, assessed using a questionnaire delivered by mail 1 and 5 years after stroke. Locomotor function was classified into 5 categories according to the grade of disability. Results: Women showed significantly worse locomotor function than men at both 1 and 5 years (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, significant gender differences in functional outcome were observed in all subtypes of ischemic stroke at 1 and 5 years after stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that gender was a significant determinant for functional outcome at 1 and 5 years after stroke (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant gender difference was seen in the rate of stroke recurrence. Women also showed a worse survival ratio after stroke than men (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated significantly worse functional outcomes for women than for men at 1 and 5 years after stroke. Gender differences in long-term functional outcomes by subtypes of ischemic stroke were also significant. © 2009 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference reports that women have significantly worse locomotor (functional) outcomes than men at both 1 and 5 years after first-ever ischemic stroke and that these gender differences are significant across all four subtypes (atherothrombotic, lacunar, cardioembolic, and unclassified). This directly supports the first half of the claim about significant differences across all subtypes. However, the claim’s wording “suggesting that women may never fully recover compared to men” introduces a broader interpretive statement that goes beyond the data: the study shows worse outcomes up to five years but does not state or provide evidence that women will never achieve full recovery relative to men. Because that part of the claim is not addressed by the reference, we cannot verify it.

s_1352,Contradiction,"Key Findings: Cognitive and Motor Functions: Initial motor and cognitive functions at admission are critical predictors of rehabilitation outcomes, and while gender differences were not significant, it is likely that they still play a role in some cases .","Background: The rehabilitation outcome varies in stroke patients, and there are differences in the literatures about the influence of factors on the functional recovery in such patients. Objective. To evaluate the pre-rehabilitative and post-rehabilitative effects of stroke patients by functional independence measure (FIM) that is widely used, and analyze the influence of gender, age, motor and cognitive functions at admission, time interval from stroke onset to arrival at rehabilitative admission, comorbidity occurrence, laterality of lesion on the functional recovery of stroke patients. Design: Before-after control observation Setting: Center of Rehabilitation Medicine, Shandong Provincial Hospital; Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, Capital University of Medical Sciences Participants: From March 2000 to December 2002, 55 stroke patients were selected from Shandong Provincial Hospital. They were all first episode, and patients whose bilateral cerebral hemisphere were involved were excluded. Methods: After the vital signs were steady, the stroke patients got through risk phase (31-75 days) and were treated with medicine improving microcirculation and providing neurotrophic factor for nerves. In addition, they accepted comprehensive rehabilitation training of Bobath technique, PNF technique and Rood method mainly, with 1-2 hours per day and five times per week. Main outcome measures: The patients were evaluated within 7 days after admission and reassessed 3 days before discharge using FIM, including 18 items of motor and cognitive functions and 126 total scores (108-126 as elementarily or completely independent, 72-107 as mildly dependent, 54-71 as moderately dependent, 36-53 as severely dependent, 18-35 as extremely or completely dependent). Multiple stepwise regression equation was applied to analyze the relation of above factors and functional recovery (increased value of FIM total score). Results: Totally 55 patients were involved into the result analysis.1 FIM total score of patients was significantly higher at discharge than at admission (93.8±12.0, 68.8±11.6, P < 0.001), and motor function and cognitive function at discharge also increased compare with at admission (P < 0.001). 2 Mean value of FIM motor score increased everyday was identical with that of total score (0.56±0.21; 0.59±0.21), and higher than mean value of cognitive score (0.03±0.03).3 Multiple stepwise regression analysis showed, scores of motor and cognitive status at admission, age, time interval from stroke onset to arrival at rehabilitative admission all affected the increased value of FIM total scores. No significant association between gender, co-morbidity, laterality lesion of paralysis and functional recovery was observed (P > 0.05). The most influential factors were orderly motor function, cognitive function at admission, age and time interval from stroke onset to arrival at rehabilitation admission. Conclusion: Motor and cognitive function at admission, age and time interval from stroke onset to arrival at rehabilitative admission have a no-table relationship with functional recovery of stroke patients, especially motor function at admission is positively related. Thus we should not neglect the influence of these factors when conducting rehabilitative treatment.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference clearly shows that initial motor and cognitive scores at admission are significant predictors of functional recovery and that gender was not significantly associated with outcomes. However, it does not provide any evidence or discussion suggesting that gender differences “still play a role in some cases.” Because the reference neither supports nor directly contradicts this speculative assertion about gender, the claim is not fully verified by the reference.

s_1353,Entailment,"However, women were found to have a higher prevalence of severe strokes (NIH Stroke Scale score ≥8) on admission, which likely leads to poorer outcomes, although the overall frequency of neurological improvement was similar between sexes .","BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Variable sex differences in clinical outcomes after stroke have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to elucidate whether sex is an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS - : Using the database of patients with acute stroke registered in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry in Japan from 1999 to 2013, 6236 previously independent patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours of onset were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were assessed on admission. Study outcomes included neurological improvement, neurological deterioration, and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6 at discharge). Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes. RESULTS - : Overall, 2398 patients (38.5%) were women. Severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ≥8) on admission was more prevalent in women than in men. The frequency of neurological improvement or deterioration during hospitalization was not different between the sexes. After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, stroke subtype and severity, risk factors, and poststroke treatments, it was found that female sex was independently associated with poor functional outcome at discharge (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.57). There was heterogeneity of the association between sex and poor outcome according to age: women had higher risk of poor outcome than men among patients aged ≥70 years, but no clear sex difference was found in patients aged <70 years. CONCLUSIONS - : Female sex was associated with the risk of poor functional outcome at discharge after acute ischemic stroke.",Entailment,"justification: The reference states that on admission, women had a higher prevalence of severe stroke (NIHSS ≥8) than men, directly matching the claim’s first part. It also reports that the frequency of neurological improvement (and deterioration) during hospitalization did not differ by sex, matching the claim’s second part. Finally, the reference shows that female sex was independently associated with poor functional outcome at discharge, supporting the claim’s suggestion that the higher severity in women “likely leads to poorer outcomes.”

Patients and Methods: We enrolled 403 consecutive patients with first-ever acute ischemic stroke (170 women, 233 men), from a referral hospital in Taiwan over a 2-year period. Gender differences in demographics, vascular risk factors, access to health care, etiological stroke subtypes, stroke severity, and outcomes were examined. The primary outcome variable of the study was any unfavorable outcome due to acute ischemic stroke, defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or higher at 90 days after stroke. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of poor outcomes. Results: There were no gender disparities in baseline severity, stroke subtypes, access to health care, and medical comorbidities. Although women had poorer outcomes, female gender was not a predictor of unfavorable outcomes. Important predictors included age of 75years or older (odds ratio [OR] = 2.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46-4.90), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale greater than or equal to 8 (OR = 8.38; 95% CI, 4.61-15.2), lack of cohabitation (OR = 2.13; 95% CI, 1.26-3.61), subtypes of cardioembolism (OR = 2.76; 95% CI, 1.29-5.93), and large-artery atherosclerosis (OR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.47-5.85). In subgroup analyses, the gender-specific independent predictors were cardioembolism (OR = 7.42; 95% CI, 2.21-24.9) or atrial fibrillation (OR = 3.57; 95% CI, 1.31-9.74) in women, and large-artery atherosclerosis (OR = 3.35; 95% CI, 1.30-8.64) or symptomatic large-artery stenosis (OR = 3.42; 95% CI, 1.69-6.96) in men. The differential effects of these predictors according to gender were revealed by interaction tests. Conclusion: Atrial fibrillation and symptomatic large-artery stenosis are predictors of poor stroke outcomes in women and men, respectively.",Entailment,"justification: The reference reports that in subgroup analyses, atrial fibrillation (a subtype of cardioembolism) is an independent predictor of poor outcomes in women (OR = 3.57; 95% CI, 1.31–9.74), while large-artery atherosclerosis is an independent predictor in men (OR = 3.35; 95% CI, 1.30–8.64).

s_1357,Contradiction,Key Findings: Survival and Living Situation: Women have a higher survival rate and are more likely to live independently at home three months post-stroke compared to men. This difference is largely attributed to their younger age and higher level of consciousness on admission .,"Background and Purpose - Previous reports concerning sex-related differences in stroke management and outcome are inconsistent and are sometimes difficult to interpret. We used data from a national stroke register to further explore possible differences between men and women in baseline characteristics, stroke treatment, and outcome. Methods - This study included 24 633 stroke events registered in Riks-Stroke, the Swedish national quality register for stroke care, during 2006. Information on background variables and treatment was collected during the hospital stay. After 3 months, the patients' living situation and outcome were assessed. Results - Women were older than men when they had their stroke (mean age, 78.4 versus 73.6 years; P<0.001). On admission to the hospital, women were more often unconscious. Among conscious patients, there was no sex-related difference in the use of stroke unit care. Men and women had equal probability to receive thrombolysis and oral anticoagulants. Women were more likely to develop deep venous thromboses and fractures, whereas men were more likely to develop pneumonia during their hospital stay. Women had a lower 3-month survival, a difference that was associated with higher age and impaired level of consciousness on admission. Women were less often living at home at the 3-month follow-up. However, the difference in residency was not present in patients <85 years who were living at home without community support before the stroke. Conclusions - Reported sex differences in stroke care and outcome were mainly explained by the women's higher age and lower level of consciousness on admission. © 2009 American Heart Association, Inc.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim states that women have higher 3-month survival and are more likely than men to live independently at home, attributing this to women’s younger age and higher level of consciousness on admission. The reference actually reports that women were older (mean age 78.4 vs 73.6), more often unconscious on admission, had lower 3-month survival, and were less often living at home at follow-up.

s_1358,Contradiction,Lifestyle Modifications: Diet and Exercise: Caloric Restriction: A 600 Kcal-restricted diet over six months resulted in significant reductions in abdominal subcutaneous and intra-abdominal fat .,"Aim: To assess the effectiveness of the current UK clinical practice in reducing hepatic fat (IHCL). Methods: Whole body MRI and <sup>1</sup>H MRS were obtained, before and after 6 mo nutritional counselling, from liver, soleus and tibialis muscles in 10 subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Results: A 500 Kcal-restricted diet resulted in an average weight loss of 4% (-3.4 kg,) accompanied by significant reductions in most adipose tissue (AT) depots, including subcutaneous (-9.9%), abdominal subcutaneous (-10.2%) and intra-abdominal-AT (-11.4%). Intramyocellular lipids (IMCL) were significantly reduced in the tibialis muscle (-28.2%). Decreases in both IHCL (-39.9%) and soleus IMCL (-12.2%) content were also observed, although these were not significant. Several individuals showed dramatic decreases in IHCL, while others paradoxically showed increases in IHCL content. Changes in body composition were accompanied by improvements in certain liver function tests: serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Significant correlations were found between decreases in IHCL and reductions in both intra-abdominal and abdominal subcutaneous AT. Improvements in liver function tests were associated with reductions in intra-abdominal AT, but not with changes in IHCL. Conclusion: This study shows that even a very modest reduction in body weight achieved through lifestyle modification can result in changes in body fat depots and improvements in LFTs. © 2006 The WJG Press.

Methods: This study was an exercise training and nutritional counseling intervention, conducted in two 6-month phases. Participants were assessed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months. Participants (54 males and 63 females aged 71-90) were randomized into immediate exercise training group (Group 1) and delayed exercise training group (Group 2). At time-point 2, the groups crossed over. Results: After the exercise training-phase by Group 1, a statistically significant increase (P < 0.05) was seen in physical activity (PA), energy intake, and total lean mass. A significant decrease was seen in weight, total fat mass, trunk fat mass, waist circumference, and blood pressure. At the 6-month follow-up, Group 1 saw a significant decrease in PA, energy intake, total lean mass and blood pressure. A significant increase was seen in waist circumference and total fat mass. After the 6-month control phase by Group 2, a significant decrease was measured in PA, systolic blood pressure, total fat mass, fat mass of the trunk and waist circumference. After a delayed 6-month exercise training-phase by Group 2, a significant increase was measured in PA, and a decrease in weight, total fat mass, trunk fat mass, waist circumference, blood pressure and triglyceride. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that positive improvements in body composition and cardiometabolic factors in old people may be achieved by systematic exercise training in combination with nutrition counseling.

s_1363,Contradiction,Non-Invasive Treatments: Topical Agents: Arnebia euchroma (AE) Ointment: Application of AE ointment significantly reduced abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference over six weeks .,"Background: Obesity is a worldwide health problem which is associated with a lot of complications. One of these comorbidities is the metabolic syndrome that is in correlation with abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference. Various methods were used to reduce abdominal fat thickness such as liposuction. A noninvasive method is the topical agent. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of Arnebia euchroma (AE) ointment on the abdominal fat thickness. Materials and Methods: This study was a double-blind clinical trial which was done at the endocrinology clinic in Khorshid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. After explaining the procedure and obtaining informed consent, the candidates were randomly divided into the case and control groups. The participants of the case and control groups applied AE ointment or placebo for 6 weeks on their abdominal area. Body mass index, waist and buttock circumference, and abdominal fat thickness were measured in both case and control groups at their first visit and then at the next 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used t-test for comparing parametric variables between groups, paired t-test for changes from baseline to final, and repeated measure ANOVA for changes at different steps. Results: Sixty female candidates participated in this study (thirty in each group). Ten patients left the study and fifty participants finished the trial. At the end of the study, participants had a significant weight loss (2.96 ± 1.6 kg, P < 0.001) that was slightly more in the case group (3.15 ± 1.5 kg vs. 2.75 ± 1.7, P = 0.375). Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 ± 6.7 cm, P < 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004). Similarly, abdominal fat thickness decreased significantly in the participants (2.3 ± 1.1 cm, P < 0.001), although changes were not significantly different between two groups (2.53 vs. 2.04 cm, P = 0.139). Conclusion: Topical AE ointment can reduce the abdominal fat thickness as well as the waist circumference without causing any side effect.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference reports that over six weeks of twice‐daily application of AE ointment, the case group experienced a 13.9 cm mean reduction in abdominal (waist) circumference versus 6.5 cm in the placebo group (P = 0.004), demonstrating a significant treatment effect on waist size. It also notes a mean 2.53 cm decrease in abdominal fat thickness in the AE group (versus 2.04 cm in controls; within-group reductions were significant and the authors conclude that AE ointment “can reduce the abdominal fat thickness as well as the waist circumference”). Thus the cited trial directly supports the claim that topical AE ointment significantly reduces both abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference over six weeks.

s_1365,Contradiction,"Combined with Exercise: RF combined with aerobic exercise may slightly improve reductions in abdominal adiposity, but the effects are likely negligible compared to exercise alone .","Background: Abdominal adiposity is a cardiovascular risk factor; it is assumed that the combination of radiofrequency and physical exercise may decrease this excess of adipose tissue. Purpose: To analyze the effect of four intervention sessions on abdominal adipose tissue. Methodology: The study analyzes the effect of four sessions of aerobic exercise combined with radiofrequency. Participants were 28 healthy female volunteers, aged 18-28 years, randomly assigned to an experimental group and a placebo group. They were characterized by a sociodemographic questionnaire, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire and the Food Frequency Questionnaire. The groups performed four sessions of abdominal radiofrequency followed by moderate aerobic exercise, assessing body mass, body mass index, fat mass, waist circumference, waist/height ratio, subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal adipose fold at the first and fourth sessions. In the experimental group, a percentage of potency was used that allowed to maintain the temperature between 40°C and 42°C to the epidermis. In the placebo group, the power of the radiofrequency was 0 W. To compare results, Student's t test was used for a significance level of 0.05. Results: There was a statistically significant decrease in waist circumference, abdominal subcutaneous adipose thickness, and horizontal abdominal fold in the experimental group compared to the placebo group (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Combined exercise intervention with radiofrequency has been shown to be effective in reducing abdominal adiposity.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference reports that adding radiofrequency to aerobic exercise produced a statistically significant additional reduction in abdominal adiposity compared to exercise with a placebo (0 W RF). This supports the claim’s point that combining RF with exercise can improve outcomes. However, the study does not report the magnitude of that additional effect or characterize it as “slight” or “negligible.” Because the claim’s qualification about the effects being “likely negligible compared to exercise alone” is neither confirmed nor contradicted by the reference, the claim cannot be fully verified.

[9] Introduction: Previous studies demonstrated that multiple treatments using focused ultrasound can be effective as an non-invasive method for reducing unwanted localized fat deposits. The objective of the study is to investigate the safety and efficacy of this focused ultrasound device in body contouring in Asians. Method: Fifty-three (51 females and 2 males) patients were enrolled into the study. Subjects had up to three treatment sessions with approximately 1-month interval in between treatment. Efficacy was assessed by changes in abdominal circumference, ultrasound fat thickness, and caliper fat thickness. Weight change was monitored to distinguish weight loss induced changes in these measurements. Patient questionnaire was completed after each treatment. The level of pain or discomfort, improvement in body contour and overall satisfaction were graded with a score of 1-5 (1 being the least). Any adverse effects such as erythema, pain during treatment or blistering were recorded. Result: The overall satisfaction amongst subjects was poor. Objective measurements by ultrasound, abdominal circumference, and caliper did not show significant difference after treatment. There is a negative correlation between the abdominal fat thickness and number of shots per treatment session. Conclusion: Focused ultrasound is not effective for noninvasive body contouring among Southern Asians as compared with Caucasian. Such observation is likely due to smaller body figures.

[14] Background: Individualised highly prescriptive lifestyle programs for obesity management tend to be limited by resource constraints and difficulty with uptake. Aim: To evaluate the health benefits of a minimally prescriptive group-based lifestyle intervention in participants with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Methods: 153 obese adults with MetS were randomised to intervention (INT) or control (CON) for 16 weeks. INT was provided with education, practical strategies and group-based support to achieve diet and physical activity (PA) modifications based on Australian national guidelines. Anthropometric, cardio-metabolic, physical fitness and diet assessments were undertaken at baseline and 16 weeks. Results: Compared with CON, INT demonstrated greater improvements in weight, BMI, body fat mass and percent, abdominal fat mass (AbdoFat) and waist circumference; systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure; total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; physical work capacity (PWC) and handgrip strength (p < 0.01, group × time for all). Energy intake and % energy from saturated fat (%Sfat) decreased in both groups (p < 0.05 for time). Dietary glycemic index (GI) decreased more in INT (p < 0.01, group × time). Reductions in weight, waist and AbdoFat were associated with reductions in %Sfat (r = 0.379, 0.306, 0.319, respectively; p < 0.01) and GI (r = 0.308, 0.411, 0.296, respectively; p < 0.01). Reductions in AbdoFat were inversely related to increased PWC (r = -0.385; p < 0.001). Withdrawals were similar in INT (6%) and CON (14%) (p = 0.48).

Results: Compared with CON, INT demonstrated greater improvements in weight, BMI, body fat mass and percent, abdominal fat mass (AbdoFat) and waist circumference; systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure; total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; physical work capacity (PWC) and handgrip strength (p < 0.01, group × time for all). Energy intake and % energy from saturated fat (%Sfat) decreased in both groups (p < 0.05 for time). Dietary glycemic index (GI) decreased more in INT (p < 0.01, group × time). Reductions in weight, waist and AbdoFat were associated with reductions in %Sfat (r = 0.379, 0.306, 0.319, respectively; p < 0.01) and GI (r = 0.308, 0.411, 0.296, respectively; p < 0.01). Reductions in AbdoFat were inversely related to increased PWC (r = -0.385; p < 0.001). Withdrawals were similar in INT (6%) and CON (14%) (p = 0.48). Conclusions: A group-based minimally prescriptive lifestyle modification program with a high retention rate achieved significant improvements in body composition, physical and cardio-metabolic fitness. Group-based programs may provide an achievable and effective, but less resource intensive, method for obesity and MetS management than individualised approaches. © 2009 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity.",Opposite meaning,"justification: The claim asserts that group-based lifestyle interventions “do not lead to significant improvements in body composition and may not reduce abdominal fat.” However, the reference describes a randomised trial of a group-based, minimally prescriptive intervention versus control over 16 weeks, reporting that the intervention group achieved significantly greater reductions in weight, BMI, body fat mass and percentage, abdominal fat mass, and waist circumference (p < 0.01 for group × time), along with improved cardio-metabolic and fitness measures. These findings directly contradict the claim’s statement of no significant body composition or abdominal fat improvements. answer: Contradiction"
s_1372,Contradiction,"Pros: Liver Health: Coffee consumption is likely the primary factor in decreased levels of liver enzyme activities, significantly reducing the risk of cirrhosis, and almost eliminating the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma .","Coffee consumption is associated with decreased levels of liver enzyme activities, gamma-GT and aminotransferases (especially when alcohol consumption or increased body mass index are present), a decreased risk of cirrhosis, compensated or not, and of death from cirrhosis (especially from alcoholic cirrhosis), a reduction in fibrosis in various chronic liver diseases and of fibrosis speed of progression in hepatitis C, and with a decrease in the prevalence and incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. In experimental studies, in animals or in vitro, coffee and some of its components (caffeine, diterpenes, and particularly polyphenols) have shown benefits in term of insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, endothelial function, antioxidant effects (some mediated by Nrf2), apoptosis, glucuronidation, and hepatic fibrogenesis. Therapeutic trials are now awaited.
[2]: Evidence demonstrating that regular ingestion of coffee has salutary effects on patients with chronic liver disease is accumulating rapidly. Specifically, it appears that coffee ingestion can slow the progression of liver fibrosis, preventing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This should excite clinicians and scientists alike, since these observations, if true, would create effective, testable hypotheses that should lead to improved understanding on fibrosis pathogenesis and thus may generate novel pharmacologic treatments of patients with chronic liver disease. This review is designed to examine the relevant clinical and epidemiological data in critical fashion and to examine the putative pharmacological effects of coffee relevant to the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. We hope that this will inspire relevant critical analyses, especially among ""coffee skeptics?. Of note, one major assumption made by this review is that the bulk of the effects of coffee consumption are mediated by caffeine, rather than by other chemical constituents of coffee. Our rationales for this assumption are threefold: first, caffeine's effects on adenosinergic signaling provide testable hypotheses; second, although there are myriad chemical constituents of coffee, they are present in very low concentrations, and perhaps more importantly, vary greatly between coffee products and production methods (it is important to note that we do not dismiss the ""botanical? hypothesis here; rather, we do not emphasize it at present due to the limitations of the studies examined); lastly, some (but not all) observational studies have examined both coffee and non-coffee caffeine consumption and found consistent effects, and when examined, no benefit to decaffeinated coffee has been observed. Further, in the interval since we examined this phenomenon last, further evidence has accumulated supporting caffeine as the effector molecule for coffee's salutary effects.",Misrepresentation,"justification: The reference clearly associates coffee consumption with decreased liver enzyme activities, reduced risk of cirrhosis, and lower incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma, matching the general benefits claimed. However, it does not establish that coffee is the primary factor driving these changes, nor does it quantify the reduction in HCC incidence as “almost eliminating” it. Because the claim’s emphasis on primacy and near-elimination exceeds what the reference explicitly supports, the claim cannot be fully verified by the provided information.

s_1376,Entailment,Pros: Metabolic Benefits: Coffee consumption is linked to a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes .,"Background: Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide. In the last years, coffee consumption has been associated with a number of beneficial effects against metabolic impairment. The aim of this narrative review was to report the most updated and comprehensive evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies as well as mechanisms of action of coffee on metabolic impairment. Methods: A search in electronic databases (PUBMED and EMBASE) was performed to retrieve systematic and pooled analyses on coffee and diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the most accredited hypotheses and mechanisms of action of coffee have been described. Results: Coffee consumption has been associated with reduced risk of diabetes in observational studies. However, the effect seems not to be mediated by caffeine. Contrasting results have been found in pooled analyses of observational studies on hypertension, despite short- and long-term follow-ups that have been demonstrated to influence the outcome. Poor or little effect on plasma lipids has been reported in studies on acute administration of coffee, yet depending on the type of coffee preparation. The main beneficial effects of coffee consumption seem to rely on the content of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds (i.e., polyphenols). Among the most important, chlorogenic acids have demonstrated direct anti-hypertensive action through beneficial effect on endothelial function, and significant improvement in glucose and insulin metabolism. Also, diterpenes and melanoidins are major candidates as antioxidant compounds showing the capacity to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators. However, caffeine and diterpenes may also exert negative effects, such as acute rise in blood pressure and serum lipids. Conclusion: In light of the most recent evidence, coffee consumption seems to be favorably related with health and to protect by metabolic impairment.
[5]: Coffee is a complex mixture of chemicals that provides significant amounts of chlorogenic acid and caffeine. Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3-4 cups/d providing 300-400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine. In addition, currently available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300 mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous abortion or impaired fetal growth.

[6]: A review of recent data dealing with coffee consumption and its beneficial effect on the prevention of type 2 diabetes is presented. It is not clear if this phenomenon is effective in humans with disturbed glucose tolerance too and if is connected with caffeine itself or with some other components present in coffee. Other pathophysiological efects of coffee are mentioned. It is concluded that in diabetic patients accustomed to drink coffee a moderate consumption is not harmful provided that other possible contraindications are absent.",Entailment,"justification: The main reference and [5] explicitly report that observational and epidemiological studies link coffee consumption with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Reference [6] also reviews data on coffee’s beneficial effect on diabetes prevention. All sources directly support the claim without contradiction or missing key details.
