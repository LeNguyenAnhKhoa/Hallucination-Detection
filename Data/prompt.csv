i_1712,Contradiction,"The use of integrated traffic micro-simulation emission models has shown that accelerated construction techniques can reduce the environmental impacts of rehabilitation processes by at least 50% compared to traditional methods, highlighting the importance of timely maintenance .","Pavement maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MRR) processes may have considerable environmental impacts due to traffic disruptions associated with work zones. Various sources indicate that greenhouse gas emissions due to traffic delays and additional fuel consumption have increased drastically over the last decades as a result of congestion. The simulation models in use to predict the emission of work-zones are mostly static emission factor models (SEFD) which calculate emissions based on average operation conditions e.g. average speed and type of vehicles. Although these models produce accurate results for large scale planning studies, they are not suitable for analyzing driving conditions at the micro level such as acceleration, deceleration, idling, cruising and queuing in a work zone. The purpose of this study is to address this gap by using integrated traffic micro-simulation emission model which can capture the effects of instantaneous changes in vehicle operation and can provide an accurate prediction of traffic impacts and emissions for a work zone related to rehabilitation of rigid pavements. Software program, INTEGRATION, was used to model real life work zone traffic scenario with traffic emissions around the area. The program is capable of computing vehicle emissions such as hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) for eleven vehicle categories. Changes in emissions were computed by simulating traffic management plans related to traditional and accelerated rigid pavement rehabilitation. The results obtained revealed the feasibility of accelerated construction in reducing the environmental impacts of rehabilitation processes by at least 60%.",Numeric error

Level-Set Techniques: While level-set methods can capture complex boundaries, they often struggle with initialization sensitivity and computational efficiency .","Automatic segmentation of ultrasonographic breast lesions is very challenging, due to the lesions' spiculated nature and the variance in shape and texture of the B-mode ultrasound images. Many studies have tried to answer this challenge by applying a variety of computational methods including: Markov random field, artificial neural networks, and active contours and level-set techniques. These studies focused on creating an automatic contour, with maximal resemblance to a manual contour, delineated by a trained radiologist. In this study, we have developed an algorithm, designed to capture the spiculated boundary of the lesion by using the properties from the corresponding ultrasonic image. This is primarily achieved through a unique multi-scale texture identifier (inspired by visual system models) integrated in a level-set framework. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated quantitatively via contour-based and region-based error metrics. We compared the algorithm-generated contour to a manual contour delineated by an expert radiologist. In addition, we suggest here a new method for performance evaluation where corrections made by the radiologist replace the algorithm-generated (original) result in the correction zones. The resulting corrected contour is then compared to the original version. The evaluation showed: (1) Mean absolute error of 0.5 pixels between the original and the corrected contour; (2) Overlapping area of 99.2% between the lesion regions, obtained by the algorithm and the corrected contour. These results are significantly better than those previously reported. In addition, we have examined the potential of our segmentation results to contribute to the discrimination between malignant and benign lesions.
[6]: In order to improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound image segmentation, an ultrasound image segmentation method using the C-V (Chan-Vese) model based on phase is proposed. First, the ultrasound image is filtered by LOG-Gabor filters in six different orientations, and the phase feature of the image is obtained by extracting the phase information in the orientation with the maximum energy. Then, the SRAD(speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion) method is used to reduce the noise of the ultrasound image, and the processed image is multiplied by the phase features to enhance the contrast of the target and background. Finally, the target of the ultrasound image is identified by the segmentation algorithm using the C-V model, and corrosion is applied to make the edge smooth and complete. The experimental results show that compared with the C-V model and GAC (geodesic active contour) model based on image gray and the ANN (artificial neural networks) method based on phase feature, the proposed method can obviously improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound image segmentation, which is 92.40%.",Related but unverifiable
i_2340,Entailment,"Water Quality and Dispenser Type: The type of water dispenser (nipple or bowl) does not significantly affect water intake in goats, although water bowls tend to have lower water quality due to higher turbidity and germ levels . This implies that the dispenser type is irrelevant to water intake, and any observed differences in water quality are likely inconsequential.","Background: Previous studies have reported that the design of the water dispensers can influence the water intake in farm animals. Horses and dairy cows seem to prefer to drink from an open surface whereas sheep and pigs apparently prefer water nipples, probably because of the worse water quality in water bowls. The aim of the present study was to examine the preference of dairy goats for water nipples or water bowls.Methods: In each of the two experiments (exp. 1, dry goats, exp. 2 lactating goats), 42 dairy goats were allotted into 6 groups of 7 goats. In period 1, the goats had access to a water nipple. In period 2, they had access to a water bowl and in period 3 (preference test) they had access to both a water nipple and a water bowl. Water usage and wastage was recorded and water intake (water usage - water wastage) was calculated for each group for the two last days of each period. In experiment 2, water samples from each dispenser were analyzed for heterotrophy germs at 22°C, Escherichia coli and turbidity.Results: Water usage was higher from water nipples than from water bowls both in experiment 1 (dry goats) and experiment 2 (lactating goats). There was however, no difference in water intake from water nipples and water bowls. In the preference test (period 3), the water intake tended to be higher from the water nipple than from the water bowl both for the dry goats (exp. 1) and lactating goats (exp. 2). Especially for the dry goats, the differences between groups were large. Turbidity and heterotrophy germs were much higher in the samples from the water bowls than from the water nipples.Water wastage from the water bowls was negligible compared to the water nipples. From the water nipples the water wastage was 30% and 23% of water usage for the dry and lactating goats respectively.Conclusions: We conclude that type of water dispenser (nipple or bowl) was probably of minor importance for water intake in goats, but water bowls had a lower water quality. © 2011 Bøe et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Entailment

To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies. However, economic analyses and user-related studies have been neglected by both academia and practice.

[12]: Bangladesh's geographical and land characteristics along the coastal area has created the most disastrous country by tropical cyclones originating in the Bay of Bengal and associated with the storm surges. During the past 61 years (1950-2011), India Meteorology Department (IMD) was observed 902 events from deep depression (tropical storm) up to super cyclonic storm (tropical cyclone category 5) with average 5 storms per year. This condition is strengthening storm surge and increasing sea level to the sudden inundation and flooding along the Bangladesh coast. Consequently, the storm surge and sea level rise are the key factor of coastal damage. Therefore, it is critical to estimate the future storm surges in a changing climate for vulnerability study and adaptation strategy. In this study, numerical simulations are performed to validate the storm surge induced by the 1991 Bangladesh cyclone, one of the deadliest cyclone in the Bay of Bengal using an atmosphere-waves-ocean integrated modelling system. Then, further numerical experiments are performed to estimate the future storm surges in 2050 and 2080 and inundation map for Bangladesh's disaster management strategy.",Opposite meaning

Bioprinting has found many applications across tissue engineering and regenerative medicine disciplines, including medical research, regenerating human tissues for transplantation, and conducting stem cell research. In order to maintain the forward momentum of bioprinting, it is necessary to consider major factors limiting bioprinting's capabilities: post-printing cell viability and printing resolution. Computational modeling has the capacity to investigate the impact dynamics of encapsulated cells as they are deposited, with a particular focus on determining the deformation of the encapsulated cell and the rate of deformation, which are dependent on, among other factors, viscoelastic features, droplet size, and velocity. Similarly, computational models can be utilized to optimize filament integrity in extrusion-based bioprinting. By harnessing the power of modeling, experimental parameters can be predicted and fine-tuned to improve cell viability and/or shape fidelity. Herein, we review extrusion-based, droplet-based, and laser-based bioprinting techniques. The respective computational models are then presented, including compound droplet impact models for droplet-based bioprinting, which incorporated a Newtonian-model and viscoelastic features, and computational models applied to extrusion-based bioprinting.

Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite reinforcement can be used in concrete structures instead of steel rebars. This composite rebar prevents the degradation of concrete structures from moisture effects. Moreover, this composite rebar reduces the structural weight and continuous fiber composites are able to arrest cracks and prevent self-similar crack propagation. However, a number of design parameters such as fiber orientation patterns and choices of constituent material combinations provide a multiplicity of design options for this structure, which requires a priori quantification of progressive damage in this composite structure and its fracture characteristics. In this paper, durability and damage tolerance (D&DT) of concrete beams with FRP composite reinforcement under static loading is evaluated using a multi-scale micro-macro progressive failure analysis (PFA) technique that augments commercial FE stress solvers. PFA predicts damage initiation and propagation, fracture initiation and propagation, and the final residual strength in the structure. The prediction is validated with experiment data obtained from full-scale beam tests. In the experiment, each specimen was tested in four-point bending with different specification. Simulation results show in detail the damage progression sequence and structural response characteristics during different degradation stages. Computational simulation provides an alternative evaluation method, giving engineers a detailed description of durability and damage tolerance would take place in the process of ultimate fracture of concrete structures with FRP reinforcement.

Sweden's national transport policy also has elements of this shift, most noticeable in the so-called four step principle, where the possibility to affect the need for transport and choice of transport mode (step 1) and the possibility to use existing infrastructure more efficiently (step 2) should be considered before large reconstructions (step 3) or new infrastructure (step 4) is chosen as the solution to transport related problems. The aim of this article is to study whether the practical implications of Swedish national transport policy are consistent with the ambitions expressed in the four step principle, with particular focus on the Swedish Transport Administration's (STA) mandate to finance different measures. Based on an analysis of policy documents and semi-structured interviews the main finding of the analysis is that many step 1 and 2 measures do not fall within the financial mandate of the STA.

Phenotypic peculiarities were examined in vitro with conventional biochemical and microbiological techniques in conformity with the requirement fixed in Good Laboratory Practice. We revealed peculiarities of microbial profiles belonging to opportunistic pathogenic microbiota on different objects in habitats. The greatest groups included staphylococci detected in the air inside medical organizations with 1-4 cleanness degree (44 %); Enterobacteriaceae family bacteria, in washes off objects located in manufacturing and medical and prevention facilities (64 % and 69 % accordingly); Pseudomonas family bacteria, in water objects (46 %). 60 (36 %) isolates out of 167 examined ones had modified morphological and tinctorial signs regarding those typical for a family. Most isolates had a set of modified or atypical metabolomic signs such as hemolytic and lecithinase activities, apparent persistent factors, and ability to create biofilms.

Government policy makers, industrial developers, and other stakeholders generally work together to develop oil sands projects in an environmentally responsible manner; however, the projects lack of an effective sustainable development measurement tool. The WA-PA-SU project sustainability rating system is a proposed framework for measuring - in a consistent manner - the sustainability of development of unconventional petroleum projects in oil sands and heavy oil. The intent of the rating system is to have a tool that can be used by companies, stakeholders, and policy makers to measure and understand the range of impacts that projects may have over time. This assessment framework includes - but is not limited to - regulatory requirements, as well as approaches for measuring sustainability on social, economic, and environmental grounds. This paper presents a brief history of oil sands development, and the structure of the rating system. This structure comprises a description of the different areas included in the rating system, and the rationale for the first tool, which is intended to assist practitioners and stakeholders in general to measure sustainable development of the oil sands and heavy oil projects. © 2012 WIT Press.",Entailment

In particular, this transition toward a more integrated and intelligent energy supply has created a plethora of energy meta-information made available through the IoT smart grid, thereby allowing big data analytical services to forecast energy consumption and to manage usage patterns. In this article, we propose a context-aware framework for intelligent power equipment management. Our contribution is to present a design of the proposed framework based on context awareness, the definition of a context ontology for power equipment management, a specification of the inference rules for the context ontology, and a context-aware inference service for power equipment management. The proposed system has broad applications to handle system monitoring and express system controls, so as to be easily and effectively applied to various application domains. [12] This research abstract provides a comprehensive overview of exploring the requirements and applications of the next generation Internet of Things (IoT).

The concept of zero-trust is enjoying increasing attention in both research and practice due to its promise to fulfil complex new network security requirements. Despite zero-trust's advantages over traditional solutions, it has not yet succeeded in replacing existing approaches. Uncertainty remains regarding the concept's distinct benefits and drawbacks for organisations and individuals, which hinders a holistic understanding of zero-trust and wide-spread adoption. Research can make valuable contributions to the field by systematically providing new insights into zero-trust. To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies.

i_676,Contradiction,"Research into new materials, such as lithium iron phosphate, aims to improve energy density and safety further .","Conspectus The commercial introduction of the lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery nearly 25 years ago marked a technological turning point. Portable electronics, dependent on energy storage devices, have permeated our world and profoundly affected our daily lives in a way that cannot be understated. Now, at a time when societies and governments alike are acutely aware of the need for advanced energy solutions, the Li-ion battery may again change the way we do business. With roughly two-thirds of daily oil consumption in the United States allotted for transportation, the possibility of efficient and affordable electric vehicles suggests a way to substantially alleviate the Country's dependence on oil and mitigate the rise of greenhouse gases. Although commercialized Li-ion batteries do not currently meet the stringent demands of a would-be, economically competitive, electrified vehicle fleet, significant efforts are being focused on promising new materials for the next generation of Li-ion batteries.The leading class of materials most suitable for the challenge is the Li- and manganese-rich class of oxides. Denoted as LMR-NMC (Li-manganese-rich, nickel, manganese, cobalt), these materials could significantly improve energy densities, cost, and safety, relative to state-of-the-art Ni- and Co-rich Li-ion cells, if successfully developed.1 The success or failure of such a development relies heavily on understanding two defining characteristics of LMR-NMC cathodes. The first is a mechanism whereby the average voltage of cells continuously decreases with each successive charge and discharge cycle. This phenomenon, known as voltage fade, decreases the energy output of cells to unacceptable levels too early in cycling. The second characteristic is a pronounced hysteresis, or voltage difference, between charge and discharge cycles. The hysteresis represents not only an energy inefficiency (i.e., energy in vs energy out) but may also complicate the state of charge/depth of discharge management of larger systems, especially when accompanied by voltage fade.In 2012, the United States Department of Energy's Office of Vehicle Technologies, well aware of the inherent potential of LMR-NMC materials for improving the energy density of automotive energy storage systems, tasked a team of scientists across the National Laboratory Complex to investigate the phenomenon of voltage fade. Unique studies using synchrotron X-ray absorption (XAS) and high-resolution diffraction (HR-XRD) were coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), neutron diffraction, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and detailed electrochemical analyses. These studies demonstrated for the first time the atomic-scale, structure-property relationships that exist between nanoscale inhomogeneities and defects, and the macroscale, electrochemical performance of these layered oxides. These inhomogeneities and defects have been directly correlated with voltage fade and hysteresis, and a model describing these mechanisms has been proposed. This Account gives a brief summary of the findings of this recently concluded, approximately three-year investigation. The interested reader is directed to the extensive body of work cited in the given references for a more comprehensive review of the subject.",Entity error

This approach has significantly increased productivity and is expected to completely resolve household nutrition issues .","Land based aquaculture has the potential to mitigate future shortfalls of food fish supply in Solomon Islands. However, aquaculture is relatively new in the Pacific and such potential is hampered by a lack of aquaculture knowledge and practice within local cultures. A participatory action research approach was used to conduct on-farm trials with farmers in Solomon Islands to develop relevant and improved ways of farming and maximising productivity of the resident exotic tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. During the 34 month period when the research was undertaken improvements were evident, through increased farmer participation and improved knowledge of farmers on pond design and fish husbandry techniques. One of the contributing factors to improved farmer understanding was the production of knowledge products which were co-developed with and based on the farmers' local context. Productivity of a typical 20–38 m<sup>2</sup> pond ranged from 726 to 1819 kg ha<sup>− 1</sup> year<sup>− 1</sup>. Because 80% of this production was consumed by households, such ponds, producing easily harvestable small tilapia, have a role in supplementing household diets and contributing to improved nutrition at the subsistence level. While pond system productivity reached levels equivalent to low input tilapia ponds in other regions, the resident tilapia in Solomon Islands has limited opportunity for more than low level commercial enterprises. Established ponds are included in the daily livelihood tasks of both men and women and explicitly gender equitable approaches to partnerships with pond farmers provide opportunities to further increase benefits to households.

[11]: Landslides in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand, India, pose a significant threat to human communities and local ecosystems. This study aims to improve landslide susceptibility modeling by integrating advanced analytical techniques with deep learning, sensitivity analysis and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Our approach captures the complex interaction between natural terrain and human intervention and provides a novel framework for risk assessment and management. In this analysis, we performed a multicollinearity analysis to ensure the independence of predictor variables. We optimized deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hybrid of CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM), using Bayesian techniques. This optimization achieved a high degree of precision in parameter tuning. In the study, multicollinearity analysis showed that no parameter exceeded the multicollinearity threshold of over 9. When evaluating accuracy, the CNN-LSTM model was found to be the most effective with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96, while DNN and CNN also had high AUCs of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. Spatially, the CNN model identified 16.28% of the total area as highly susceptible, while the hybrid CNN-LSTM model delineated 13.39%.

However, the benefit possible from global use of ICTs cannot be realized without a corresponding build up of digital infrastructure. This projected increase in ICT products is of particular concern to environmental sustainability, in large part due to the global health, safety, and environmental effects of managing these products in the waste stream. The ability to quantify and manage environmental impacts of ICT products is complicated by continuous evolution of product form and function. The work described herein provides an assessment of how changing form factor and material composition in common consumer electronics - desktop and notebook computers - may influence the electronic waste stream in the U.S. Results indicate that dematerialization on a per product basis is largely offset by increasing volumes of the total waste stream. From an economic standpoint, end-of-life value will be enhanced by the increasing use of lightweight materials such as aluminum and magnesium but potentially impacted by decreasing precious metal content.

SDN separates data and control plane, which provides network administrator better visibility and policy enforcement capability compared to traditional networks. The SDN controller can assess reachability infor- mation of all the hosts in a network. There are many critical assets in a network which can be compromised by a malicious attacker through a multistage attack. Thus we make use of centralized controller to assess the security state of the entire network and pro-actively perform attack analysis and coun- termeasure selection. This approach is also known as Mov- ing Target Defense (MTD). We use the SDN controller to assess the attack scenarios through scalable Attack Graphs (AG) and select necessary countermeasures to perform net- work reconfiguration to counter network attacks. Moreover, our framework has a comprehensive con ict detection and resolution module that ensures that no two ow rules in a distributed SDN-based cloud environment have conflicts at any layer; thereby assuring consistent conflict-free policy implementation and preventing information leakage.
[8]: Servers in a network are typically assigned a static identity. Static assignment of identities is a cornerstone for adversaries in finding targets. Moving Target Defense (MTD) mutates the environment to increase unpredictability for an attacker. On another side, Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitate a global view of a network through a central control point. The potential of SDN can not only make network management flexible and convenient, but it can also assist MTD to enhance attack surface obfuscation. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of flooding-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our framework includes a lightweight SDN assisted MTD strategy for network reconnaissance protection and an efficient approach for tackling DoS attacks using Software Defined-Internet Exchange Point (SD-IXP). To assess the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and DoS mitigation scheme, we set two different experiments. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our framework. With the MTD strategy in place, at maximum, barely 16% reconnaissance attempts were successful while the DoS attacks were accurately detected with false alarm rate as low as 7.1%.",Related but unverifiable
i_870,Contradiction,"Machining Environment: Lubrication: Using cutting fluids (wet conditions) can significantly reduce burr size compared to dry conditions. However, mist lubrication can also be effective while being more environmentally friendly .","The burr formation mechanisms strongly depend on the machining methods as well as cutting conditions. Cutting fluids play significant roles in machining, including reduction of friction and temperature. Using a cutting fluid, however, degrades the quality of the environment and increases machining costs. In the present work, initially the effects of cutting fluid application (dry, mist and flood) and their interaction with cutting parameters on the burr size during drilling of 6061-T6 aluminum alloys were investigated using multi-level full factorial design. Second-order non-linear mathematical models were developed to predict burr height for various lubrication modes. The accuracy of the regression equations formulated to predict burr height when using different lubrication modes has been verified through carrying out random experiments in the range of variation of these variables. A procedure was developed to minimize burr size for drilling holes by presenting the optimal levels of process parameters. Taguchi optimization method based on L9 orthogonal array design of experiment was then used which has shown very accurate process parameters selection that leads to minimum burr height. According to experimental study, it was observed that dry and mist drilling can produce parts with quality comparable with those obtained in wet drilling when using the optimal cutting conditions.

i_1147,Unverifiable,"Contact lenses, which provide refractive correction during the day, have been effective in reducing axial elongation and myopia progression .","Myopia is an important public health issue, and high myopia may lead to severe complications if left untreated. Orthokeratology lenses, worn overnight to reshape the cornea, are one of many recent modalities used to slow down the progression of myopia in children. This treatment has been proven successful, as evidenced by decreased spherical refractive error and axial length relative to the control at interval follow-up ranging from 6 months to 5 years. In this systematic review, the authors collected published controlled studies that analyzed the efficacy of orthokeratology lens wear and calculated longitudinal relative changes in axial length, revealing a weighted average of -45.1% change in axial length at the 2-year follow-up. The exact mechanism by which orthokeratology lenses reduce myopia progression is unknown, but research shows that the corneal reshaping decreases peripheral hyperopic defocus and therefore increases peripheral myopic defocus to likely reduce stimuli for axial elongation and subsequent development of myopia. Use of orthokeratology lenses is generally safe, but cases of associated infectious keratitis may have a higher incidence of virulent organisms such as Pseudomonas, Acanthamoeba, and antibacterial-resistant strains of Staphylococcus, partially due to the required overnight use of these lenses. Orthokeratology is regarded as one of the most effective non-pharmacologic measures to slow progression of myopia in children and, with regular follow-up to ensure safety, continues to be one of the most effective treatments for myopia management around the world.
[5]: Purpose: To review the published evidence to evaluate the ability of orthokeratology (Ortho-K) treatment to reduce myopic progression in children and adolescents compared with the use of spectacles or daytime contact lenses for standard refractive correction. Methods: Literature searches of the PubMed database, the Cochrane Library, and the databases of clinical trials were last conducted on August 21, 2018, with no date restrictions but limited to articles published in English. These searches yielded 162 citations, of which 13 were deemed clinically relevant for full-text review and inclusion in this assessment. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating to the selected studies. Results: The 13 articles selected for inclusion include 3 prospective, randomized clinical trials; 7 nonrandomized, prospective comparative studies; and 3 retrospective case series. One study provided level I evidence, 11 studies provided level II evidence, and 1 study provided level III evidence. Most studies were performed in populations of Asian ethnicity. Change in axial length was the primary outcome for 10 of 13 studies and change in refraction was the primary outcome for 3 of 13 studies. In these studies, Ortho-K typically reduced axial elongation by approximately 50% over a 2-year study period. This corresponds to average axial length change values of approximately 0.3 mm for Ortho-K patients compared with 0.6 mm for control patients, which corresponds to a typical difference in refraction of approximately 0.5 diopters (D). Younger age groups and individuals with larger than average pupil size may have a greater effect with Ortho-K. Rebound can occur after discontinuation or change to alternative refractive treatment. Conclusions: Orthokeratology may be effective in slowing myopic progression for children and adolescents, with a potentially greater effect when initiated at an early age (6–8 years). Safety remains a concern because of the risk of potentially blinding microbial keratitis from contact lens wear.",Related but unverifiable

Twenty-four 5-6-month-old Barbarine lambs (initial live weight 18.6 ± 1.98. kg) were allotted to four equal groups, all of which received oaten hay ad libitum and 400. g concentrate per animal. Immediately after offering the morning meal 10. ml water solutions containing 30, 60 or 90. mg of QS/kg DMI were orally administrated. Feed intake and growth rates were measured for 57 days. Thereafter, lambs were allowed a 4-day acclimation to metabolic cages before starting a 5-day total collection period. QS had no effect on total dry matter and water intakes. Administration of 60 or 90. mg QS/kg DMI decreased NDF digestibility (P=0.011); however, it had no effect on crude protein digestibility, N retention, microbial N supply and ammonia concentration in the rumen fluid suggesting that QS did not improve, as expected, the efficiency of N utilisation although a linear reduction of protozoa count in the rumen fluid just before or 4. h after distribution of the morning feed (P=0.0027 and P=0.0011, respectively) was observed. Blood profiles indicated that QS had no effect (P>0.05) on plasma urea and cholesterol concentrations. However, lambs receiving QS exhibited lower (P<0.05) concentration of plasma glucose than control lambs (without QS). No effect on both feed intake and efficiency of N utilisation may explain the absence of response of QS extracts (30-90. mg/kg DMI) on animal growth. Saturated fatty acids (SFA) and monounsaturated fatty acids in lamb meat were not influenced by the QS supplementation (P>0.05). Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and the ratio PUFA to SFA tended to be higher in meat from the QS-supplemented animals than from control lambs. It is concluded that the administration of 30, 60 or 90. mg QS/kg DMI had a defaunation effect but failed to improve feed digestibility, growth performance and meat quality of Barbarine lambs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. [13] Utilization of low-input feed resources rich in plant bioactive compounds is a promising strategy for modulating the fatty acid profile in ruminant products. They manipulate microbes involved in rumen biohydrogenation and increase the accumulation of desirable fatty acids at the tissue level. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to assess the effect of dietary supplementation of aniseed straw and eucalyptus leaves on growth performance, carcass traits and fatty acid profile of finisher lambs. Thirty-six Malpura hogget were divided into three treatment groups of 12 each, reared individually in pen (1.6 m × 1.1 m) and fed ad libitum complete feed blocks made up of 55 parts concentrate, 5 parts molasses and 40 parts roughage. Roughage in control (Con) was 20 parts each of ardu (Ailanthus excelsa) leaves and oat (Avena sativa) straw. In test diets, that is, Con-as and Con-el, 10% aniseed (Pimpinella anisum) straw and Eucalyptus rudis leaves, respectively, were added by replacing 5% each of oat straw and eucalyptus leaves. The lambs were weighed weekly; and at the end of 3 months of feeding trial, the lambs were slaughtered to study the carcass traits, composition and product evaluation. Average daily gain (ADG) and DM intake (DMI) was higher (P < 0.05) in Con-as compared to Con and Con-el, while ADG and feed conversion ratio decreased (P < 0.05) by 29.4% and 36.4%, respectively, in Con-el compared to Con. Carcass traits showed lower (P < 0.05) loin eye area and chilling loss in the Con-el group compared to the Con-as and Con, and the total carcass fat compared to Con-as. However, the keeping quality of meat improved in both Con-as and Con-el which was reflected by lower (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances values. Nuggets prepared from Con and Con-as meat had superior (P < 0.05) sensory attributes with an overall palatability. Fatty acid profile of longissimus thoracis muscle showed lower (P < 0.05) atherogenic and thrombogenic indices in Con-as and higher (P < 0.05) in Con-el group. Moreover, in Con-as group, the proportion of C16:0 was lower (P < 0.05) and C18:3n-3 was higher (P < 0.05), but no effect was observed on the amount of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA; C18:2 c9t11). In case of adipose tissue, the content of CLA was higher (P < 0.05), and the ratio of n-6:n-3 was more nearer to desirable levels in Con-as group. Therefore, it can be concluded that aniseed straw is a promising feed supplement compared to eucalyptus leaves for improving meat quality and fatty acid profile in lambs.",Unrelated and unverifiable

This holistic approach is likely to guarantee the stability and growth of rural areas, although it may not be sufficient in all contexts .","The study of the relevance of the developing management trends in agriculture is rationalized by the fact that the agrarian sector is one of the most important and most dynamically developing sectors of the national economy. The aim of the study is to identify and systematize the methodological prerequisites for solving the problems of sustainable development of rural areas and their management. It was concluded that the sustainable development of rural areas contributed to the fulfillment of their economic functions, including the provision of food, agricultural raw stock, public goods, the production of goods and services, the preservation of the rural way of life and rural culture, enhanced reproduction of the population, development of public welfare and living standards, maintaining the ecological balance in the biosphere, as well as overcoming the interagency disunity between various levels of governance when deciding on the development of rural areas, which implied social partnership among the rural population, regions and the state. This made it possible to deepen the understanding of the nature of the emergence of agrarian crises and to justify the stability of the crisis trend as an initial prerequisite for the formation of a system for managing the development of both the entire economy and the agricultural sector, particularly in the context of analysis of the cyclical development of the economy and modern crisis theories.
[8]: The concept of sustainable development was widely adopted at the global level of development of society in the world. At the same time transition to sustainable development and giving of irreversible character to it are impossible without complex development of rural territories. In national economy it is necessary to begin development with rise in agriculture. In modern operating conditions of the majority of regions of Russia and its rural territories, development of the methods providing their sustainable development is impossible without active state position on an institutional basis and also on the basis of social and innovative development of territories taking into account their features, the developed specialization and infrastructure. In this research four interconnected methods on ensuring sustainable development of rural territories on the example of the Saratov region are developed. The differential and production method is based on growth of efficiency of agrarian production at use of intensive technologies, increase in a share of crops of perspective highly profitable cultures depending on climatic and economic features of various microzones of the region, on technological re-equipment of branches of crop production. All this will allow to create internal funds of development of production and the social sphere of the village. The innovative and investment method is based on accumulation of means from different sources in regional fund and definition of the directions of the projects focused on development of infrastructure and increase in investment attractiveness and innovative activity. At initiation of projects by authorities, business structures, the population and granting means from Fund, various innovative and investment directions for rural territories taking into account branch specialization of areas and assessment of their requirements will develop. The method of improvement of social infrastructure of the village leans on the tools leading to improvement of infrastructure of municipal units depending on their territorial and branch accessory, level of financing of the social sphere and providing social and engineering infrastructure with objects. The structural and institutional method assumes improvement of management of sustainable development of rural territories and ensuring optimization of decision-making at all levels.",Entailment

Building on previous domain adaptation works, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach for deep learning architectures via the introduction of local-statistic batch normalization (BN) layers, resulting in collaboratively-trained, yet center-specific models. This strategy improves robustness to data heterogeneity while also reducing the potential for information leaks by not sharing the center-specific layer activation statistics.

The changes of energy balance and vegetation index are two main factors to influence the precision of the TVDI. The MODIS (Moderate....) data products, as RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI(Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI(Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and Ts(Land Surface Temperatures), are applied and the DEM (ASTER-GDEM) data are used to correct the Ts data for the reduction of the topographic influences by topographic relief. The TVDI is then employed by comparison of different vegetation index, where the TVDI is more sensitive to soil moisture. Thus the dry situation in the study area is analyzed during the plant growth time and compared by the synchronous meteorology data. The results indicate that: (1) terrain correction can effectively prevent the decrease of TVDI value from a lower surface temperature for a higher pixel. The correlation between Ts-NDVI index and measured values on May is compared, R<sup>2</sup> will increase from 0.4634 to 0.5859 by terrain correction.

(3) Large area of the study area was humid from May to September 2005, drought occurred in the West on August, and humid was located in East on June. Therefore, compared with the measured data, the terrain corrected TVDI model is robust to eliminate the terrain and land cover influences to land surface temperature for inversion of soil moisture in the study area.

The stakeholder theory was used to examine how stakeholders' expectations affected environmental CSR, green innovation activities and how corporate innovation initiatives affected corporate image and corporate social performance. Corporate environmental practices refer to the entire process of adopting technologies and product designs for protecting and sustaining natural resources. Selected companies in Ghana were used for this study. The study employed a cross-sectional quantitative approach where data from employees were collected across six months. This study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the effects of environmental CSR on social performance through mediators: green innovation and corporate image. The empirical findings demonstrate that corporate environmental CSR practices have an impact on the development of green innovations that promote companies' social performance. Additionally, evidence from the findings supports that corporate image influences companies' social performance in Ghana. Furthermore, the findings from the study demonstrate that corporate environmental CSR enhances corporate social performance through green innovation and corporate image. The study recommends green innovation adoption to improve CSR practices, corporate image and corporate social performance.
[11]: Organizations increasingly recognize that environmental sustainability is an urgent problem. Green information systems (Green IS) initiatives can assist organizations in reaching their environmental goals by providing the ability to reduce the environmental impacts of information technology (IT) manufacturing, operations and disposal; facilitate transparency and enhance the efficiency of organizational resources and business processes; and foster eco-products through technological innovation. However, the nature and type of benefits such initiatives can accrue remain poorly understood, and accordingly, IT executives struggle to integrate environmental aspects in the corporate strategy and to launch Green IS initiatives. This paper clarifies the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability to Green IT and Green IS actions undertaken, and the organizational benefits that accrue from these actions. Using data from a global survey of 118 senior-level IT executives, we find that Green IS strategies mediate the relationship between environmental orientation and the implementation of Green IT practices and Green IS practices, which in turn lead to organizational benefits in the form of cost reductions, corporate reputation enhancement and Green innovation capabilities. Our findings have implications for the potential of IS to enable organizations' environmental sustainability and also for the differentiation of Green IT and Green IS practices.",Entailment

For this purpose, the vehicles are equipped with built-in batteries for short and medium distances and are therefore sufficient for the majority of daily journeys. For long-distance journeys, the driver borrows charged additional battery packs at swapping stations, which are automatically inserted into a standardised exchange slot within a few minutes. This paper focuses on the improvements in electric vehicles that can be achieved by combining built-in and exchangeable battery technique and also on the practical feasibility of the concept. It is shown that the battery capacity required for the entire vehicle fleet can be significantly reduced. The resulting ecological advantages on the one hand and grid-stabilising effects of a nationwide network of swapping stations on the other hand, support the transition to environmentally sustainable mobility. The characteristics of the concept presented are advantageous for its practical implementation. The acceptance by customers and manufacturers can thus be improved compared to previous battery swapping systems.

s_2211,Contradiction,"Positive Environmental Effects: Benefit to Marine Mammals and Seabirds: Offshore wind farms can enhance the habitats of marine mammals and seabirds. The construction and operation of these farms can lead to habitat improvement, reduced disturbance from noise, and decreased collision risks for birds .","Offshore wind power provides a valuable source of renewable energy that can help reduce carbon emissions. Technological advances are allowing higher capacity turbines to be installed and in deeper water, but there is still much that is unknown about the effects on the environment. Here we describe the lessons learned based on the recent literature and our experience with assessing impacts of offshore wind developments on marine mammals and seabirds, and make recommendations for future monitoring and assessment as interest in offshore wind energy grows around the world. The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. As the number and size of offshore wind developments increases, there will be a growing need to consider the population level consequences and cumulative impacts of these activities on marine species. Strategically targeted data collection and modeling aimed at answering questions for the consenting process will also allow regulators to make decisions based on the best available information, and achieve a balance between climate change targets and environmental legislation.
[3]: Wind energy is the fastest growing source of electricity in the U. S., and the energy potential,in the offshore environment is enormous. Environmental concerns have focused on,effects on birds, and in this paper we briefly review these effects in the context of methods for,assessing preconstruction risk and postconstruction impact. Federal statutes and legislation,including the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Energy Act of 2005, the Endangered,Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty will require that prospective developers conduct,some form of avian risk assessment prior to construction. Such preconstruction studies,should utilize a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design.,Offshore wind farms pose three primary threats to birds: barrier effects due to flight,avoidance, habitat loss (due to displacement), and fatalities resulting from collisions with,turbine blades. All have been demonstrated at land-based and coastal wind farms, and flight,avoidance and shifts in habitat use have been demonstrated in the offshore environment for a,limited number of species in Europe. The additive effect of these impacts to bird populations,may be trivial under current levels of development, but could become ecologically significant,as offshore installations increase as projected.,Interpreting the ecological significance of these effects requires additional research, especially,on understanding the importance of winter foraging habitat and population delineation,particularly for waterfowl. Such research and preconstruction studies will be expensive, and,we suggest public funding of these efforts and private-public partnerships as is currently,underway in some states.
[4]: Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

s_2110,Contradiction,"Natural Filtration Methods: Phyto-purification is ineffective as it fails to utilize the natural purifying properties of microalgae (microphytes) and aquatic plants (macrophytes). The microalgae-based process does not involve basins where microphytes and indigenous aerobic bacteria treat wastewater, and instead, these organisms are unable to consume organic, nitrogen, and phosphate pollutants. The macrophyte-based system lacks a functional filter system and does not support bacteria that convert organic matter into minerals, resulting in no oxygen supply to the bacteria .","Phyto-purification is a technique for wastewater treatment that harnesses the natural purifying properties of microalgae (microphytes) and aquatic plants (macrophytes). This process is commonly referred to as microphyte or aerated lagoons and macrophyte planted filters. Phytowastewater treatment is particularly recommended for isolated dwellings, such as those found in rural areas, small communities, and villages. The reason for this is that it is cheaper to install compared to connecting to a centralized sewage system in urban areas. In addition, the water can be reused for various purposes, such as watering gardens, without posing a risk to the surface or groundwater. Treated wastewater can also be safely discharged into natural bodies of water, such as rivers, lakes, lagoons, and oceans. Phytodewatering, or wastewater treatment, is a technique based on the interaction between microphytes or aquatic plants, aerobic indigenous bacteria, and oxygen. Two main processes effectively reduce the pollutant load in wastewater and produce high-quality purified water. Microalgae-based phytodewatering, also known as lagoon treatment, involves a series of basins of varying dimensions and depths. In these basins, microphytes with indigenous aerobic bacteria act as the primary biological agents for bioremediation. The wastewater remains in the basins for an extended period, allowing the planktonic algae to thrive and consume the organic, nitrogen, and phosphate pollutants in the wastewater. The process of phytoepuration with macrophytes is usually divided into two stages. First, a vertical flow filter consists of gravel and aquatic plants such as Phragmites australis, followed by a second horizontal flow filter consisting of stones, gravel, pozzolana, and aquatic plants such as Juncus effuses, or ""Junco"". The roots of these plants provide a foundation for indigenous aerobic bacteria, which convert organic matter into minerals that can be absorbed by plants. In return, aquatic plants supply oxygen to the bacteria through their roots. Besides treating residential wastewater, this phytoprocess can also be used for greywater purification. The roles of microorganisms in wastewater treatment are twofold: algae's photosynthesis increases the water's oxygen content, influencing nutrient levels and reactions in the wastewater, while microorganisms consume mineral and organic pollutants present in the effluents and mineralize organic matter to make it accessible to plants. These complex bio-physical-chemical processes always occur within a close collaboration between plants and microorganisms and result in a good-treated wastewater quality suitable for discharge into the natural environment and agricultural reuse.",Opposite meaning

Despite their value for biodiversity and water retention, the impact of fish ponds on the receiving streams as regards fine sediment and nutrient pollution remains controversial. This holds particularly true for streams with endangered freshwater pearl mussels, requiring a highly permeable streambed with low fine sediment content for successful juvenile development. This study quantified the amount of fine sediment, suspended solids and nutrients delivered to pearl mussel streams in relation to the pond characteristics, distance to the receiving stream and applications of measures to prevent the input of fines. Comparing fine sediment deposition above and downstream of the pond inlets after 21 pond drainage operations, as well as continuous measurements of the turbidity for 12 operations revealed varying effects of pond fishing on the receiving streams. Average fine sediment deposition was increased by nearly six-fold compared to upstream and maximum turbidity values for single drainage operations exceeded 460 NTU. Draining between 1% and 92% of the water volume of individual ponds resulted in additional loading of 0.07–4.6 t suspended particles. Physical mitigation structures that prevent mobilized material from reaching the receiving stream significantly reduced the fine sediment input and deposition rates. Harvesting methods that do not require complete drainage of the pond reduced the turbidity by ten-fold. Without mitigation measures, the impact of pond drainage operations on the fine sediment deposition was comparable to high discharge events. No significant increase in nutrient concentration was observed during most drainage operations. These results reveal remarkable effects of pond drainage on the aquatic environment, as well as the possibility to minimize such impacts by switching to harvest methods that do not require complete pond drainage and installation of sedimentation structures.",Entailment

To help mitigate the impact, most clinics have adopted new virtual care options and are now evaluating usage, impact, and concerns. Further research into the effects of telemedicine on HIV care and continued work towards universal access are needed.",Entity error
i_1181,Entailment,"Another study indicated that high dairy intake, including high-fat dairy, did not lead to significant changes in body weight or body composition during a weight maintenance phase .","Background. To compare the effects of low versus recommended levels of dairy intake on weight maintenance and body composition subsequent to weight loss. Design and Methods. Two site (University of Kansas-KU; University of Tennessee-UT), 9 month, randomized trial. Weight loss was baseline to 3 months, weight maintenance was 4 to 9 months. Participants were maintained randomly assigned to low dairy (< 1 dairy serving/d) or recommended dairy (> 3 servings/d) diets for the maintenance phase. Three hundred thirty eight men and women, age: 40.3 ± 7.0 years and BMI: 34.5 ± 3.1, were randomized; Change in weight and body composition (total fat, trunk fat) from 4 to 9 months were the primary outcomes. Blood chemistry, blood pressure, resting metabolism, and respiratory quotient were secondary outcomes. Energy intake, calcium intake, dairy intake, and physical activity were measured as process evaluation. Results. During weight maintenance, there were no overall significant differences for weight or body composition between the low and recommended dairy groups. A significant site interaction occurred with the low dairy group at KU maintaining weight and body composition and the low dairy group at UT increasing weight and body fat. The recommended dairy group exhibited reductions in plasma 1,25-(OH)<inf>2</inf>-D while no change was observed in the low dairy group. No other differences were found for blood chemistry, blood pressure or physical activity between low and recommended dairy groups. The recommended dairy group showed significantly greater energy intake and lower respiratory quotient compared to the low dairy group. Conclusion. Weight maintenance was similar for low and recommended dairy groups. The recommended dairy group exhibited evidence of greater fat oxidation and was able to consume greater energy without greater weight gain compared to the low dairy group. Recommended levels of dairy products may be used during weight maintenance without contributing to weight gain compared to diets low in dairy products. Trial Registration.

i_1321,Entailment,"Clinical Manifestations: Upper GI Hemorrhage: This can present as hematemesis (vomiting blood) or melena (black, tarry stools) and is a common complication of stress ulcers .","The term gastritis refers to an inflammatory condition of the gastric mucosa. It is sometimes associated with the concept of peptic disease, although it is not always like that. Peptic ulcers are mucosal lesions of varying depth. They can affect gastric or duodenal mucosa. One of the most common causes of gastritis and peptic disease in children is infection with Helicobacter pylori. The role of H. pylori in other entities different from peptic disease is sometimes controversial. Gastrointestinal bleeding can be upper bleeding (above the ligament of Treitz) or lower (distal to this structure). In upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the manifestation can be hematemesis or melena, while the lower can be revealed in rectal bleeding, hematochezia or melena. In this manuscript we review the most frequent causes of these affections.
[7]: Hematemesis and acute postsurgical upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage are common emergent on-call consultations for the interventional radiologist. Upper GI bleleding (UGIB) is a relatively frequent problem. The incidence and mortality vary among patient populations, but studies have shown an overall incidence ranging from 36-172 cases per 100,000 adults per year, with a mortality rate of 5%-14%. The incidence is significantly higher in men. Peptic ulcer disease is the predominant etiology, responsible for 28%-59% of UGIB. Other causes include varices, mucosal erosive disease, Mallory-Weiss syndrome, and malignancy. After assessment of hemodynamic status and airway stability with resuscitative efforts as needed, initial consultation with gastroenterology for endoscopic evaluation and treatment is well regarded as the initial therapeutic strategy. Angiography with embolization and interventional techniques directed at managing variceal hemorrhage have emerged as very capable second-line strategies for patients who have failed endoscopic therapy. In certain circumstances, the interventional radiologist may be called upon as the first line, notably for patients who have had recent surgical intervention or who have extraluminal hemorrhage. As the role of the interventional radiologist in the evaluation and treatment of UGIB continues to evolve, familiarity and knowledge of how to deal with these urgent and emergent clinical scenarios becomes paramount.",Entailment

The nature of these systems makes traditional IT security measures not suitable, requiring expressly developed security countermeasures. Within the past decades, research has been focused in network-based intrusion detection systems. With the appearance of software-defined networks (SDNs), new opportunities and challenges have shown up in the research community. This paper describes the potential benefits of using SDNs in industrial networks with security purposes and presents the set up and results of a pilot experiment carried out in a scaled physical implementation.

s_2109,Entailment,"Inferred Insights for Lebanon: Potential for High Variability: Similar to other regions, Lebanon's groundwater nitrate concentrations may exhibit high spatial and temporal variability due to diverse land use and hydrological conditions .","Groundwater nitrate concentrations in the Permo-Triassic aquifer of the Eden Valley vary from less than 4 mg l<sup>-1</sup> to in excess of 100 mg l<sup>-1</sup> (as NO<inf>3</inf>). A significant number of boreholes exhibit rising trends in nitrate concentration that either approach or exceed the CEC Directive 80/778 Maximum Admissible Concentration (MAC) of 50 mg l<sup>-1</sup>. The main source of the nitrate is believed to be the nitrogen applied to grassland, both as slurry and as inorganic fertilizers. The variability in groundwater nitrate concentrations is thought to be due in part to land use, particularly where low-yielding boreholes derive their water from a limited/localized area, and in part due to the variability in the travel times for water and solutes to migrate from the soil to the water table and then to the borehole. This variability in travel times is a function of surficial geology, depth to water table, depth of borehole and superficial deposit thickness, amongst other factors. It is surprising, given the considerable storage within the saturated zone of the aquifer and the slow groundwater movement, that some relatively deep boreholes pump groundwater with nitrate concentrations in excess of 20 mgl<sup>-1</sup>. Simple numerical modelling suggests that the fraction of modern water pumped is sensitive to the presence of fissures close to the abstraction boreholes and the location of the boreholes relative to superficial deposits. For some scenarios, using realistic superficial deposit geometries and aquifer hydraulic parameters, the proportion of modern water (water that is derived from infiltration that reached the water table since pumping started) could exceed 40% within 15 years of pumping. © The Geological Society of London 2006.
[2]: Nitrate in groundwater from alluvial and weathered granitic aquifers was monitored for 1–1.5 years on a monthly basis in an agricultural area with a high density of livestock feedlots to identify the main factors that control temporal variations in nitrate concentration. The baseline-loading group had median NO<inf>3</inf>–N concentrations of 5–7 mg/L, with temporal variations of 5–34 % indicating less impact of nitrogen sources. This group was mainly located in paddy fields, areas that have limited rainfall recharge during summer monsoon. Upland wells and those near livestock facilities had median NO<inf>3</inf>–N concentrations of 11–41 mg/L with temporal variations of 10–87 %, which were designated as the elevated-loading group. Overall, nitrate concentrations in groundwater decreased during dry/growing season of spring and fall due to the mixing of the groundwater in these areas with deeper groundwater because of heavy pumping, whereas nitrate concentrations increased during summer monsoon due to infiltration of the nitrate concentrated in the soil zone, and the level was maintained or rebounded during dry/fallow season. Multiple linear regression showed that nitrate was positively explained by SO<inf>4</inf>, Cl, and DO, and negatively explained by pH and HCO<inf>3</inf> indicating groundwater recharge and mixing of shallow and deep groundwater are important factors for nitrate contamination. These results show that nitrate concentrations in groundwater were controlled more by hydrologic processes than by biogeochemical processes, because most wells were considerably oxic. However, some of the wells were suboxic, and they exhibited increased Cl/NO<inf>3</inf> ratio and concentrations of HCO<inf>3</inf> and Mn(II) and decreased nitrate concentrations. Furthermore, NH<inf>3</inf>–N was detected up to 2.6 mg/L with a sharp decrease in nitrate concentrations in one well, suggesting that dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonia and denitrification contributed to reduction in nitrate concentrations. This study revealed the effects of hydrologic and biogeochemical processes on temporal variations in nitrate concentrations in groundwater with high N loadings due to agricultural activity and a low potential for nitrate attenuation.
[5]: Intensive farming usually imply a degradation of groundwater resources worldwide. In particular, nitrate concentrations exceeding the 50 mg L<sup>−1</sup> limit established for drinking water pose the human health at risk. Therefore, assessing the impact of farming on groundwater, in terms of space and time, is of fundamental importance for policy decision makers and land managers. This study was aimed at assessing the nitrate source and fate in groundwater by combining hydrogeochemical and isotopic tools. The study area is located in the coastal plain of Arborea (Italy), a nitrate vulnerable zone (NVZ) due to intensive farming and animal husbandry (28,000 bovine livestock units). This area represents Mediterranean environments where groundwater resources are of relevant importance. In order to assess the present level of groundwater contamination and evaluate temporal variations, 6 hydrogeochemical surveys were carried out bimonthly at 13 sampling sites located in an area of 6 km<sup>2</sup>. Additional samples were collected in specific surveys (82 water samples in total). The physical-chemical parameters, nitrogen species concentrations, major and minor components were determined, together with the boron, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur isotopic delta values. Results showed that groundwater samples were of meteoric origin, as indicated by the δ<sup>2</sup>H and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>H2O</inf> values. The groundwater showed near-neutral pH (6.8–7.9) and different values of redox potential (0.2 ÷ 0.5 V), dissolved oxygen (2 ÷ 6 mg L<sup>−1</sup>), electrical conductivity (0.8 ÷ 2.1 mS cm<sup>−1</sup>) and chemical composition (sodium-chloride ÷ calcium-bicarbonate). Nitrate was not homogeneously distributed in groundwater, being observed a large range of concentrations, from <1 up to 162 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The above differences reflected the variability of groundwater circulation at small scale, which in turn controlled the interaction of water with different sediments (sands and/or clays). The shallow wells (about 5 m depth), screened in groundwater interacting mainly with sands, showed marked variations under the monitoring period, with nitrate peaks reflecting high leaching of nitrate in correspondence of fertilization and irrigation periods. The deeper wells (15–37 m depth) showed high to moderate nitrate when screened in sandy aquifer, whereas they had very low nitrate and relatively high ammonium (up to 1.8 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) when clay layers were intercepted. Trends of δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>NO3</inf> values in the nitrate of shallow groundwater were related to the nitrate concentration observed over the monitored period. This dual isotope systematic showed a likely source of nitrate in groundwater from either manure or sewage. The δ<sup>11</sup>B signature coupled to δ<sup>15</sup>N values clearly identified the manure as the predominant source of nitrate in the shallow and deep groundwater at Arborea. Relative enrichments in heavy nitrogen coupled to high concentrations of nitrate in groundwater were mainly attributed to volatilization processes occurring during the storage of animal wastes prior to application on the soil. Mixing of groundwater with seawater was not recognized, whereas mixing between shallow and deep groundwater may have occurred locally. Natural attenuation of nitrate contamination was observed in the deep groundwater interacting with lagoon clays rich in organic matter. Heterotrophic denitrification processes were highlighted by relatively high δ<sup>15</sup>N, δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>NO3</inf>, δ<sup>34</sup>S and δ<sup>18</sup>O<inf>SO4</inf> values in association with low SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2−</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup> and high HCO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>/SO<inf>4</inf><sup>2−</sup> molar ratios observed in the groundwater with low concentration of nitrate. Results of this study showed that site-specific investigations are required for designing the best practices aimed at preserving groundwater resources under Mediterranean conditions. The spreading of animal waste on soils affects groundwater systems and likely extends over long time, strongly depending on the time lag of nutrient transport from source areas to receptor wells. Therefore, adequate monitoring of groundwater quality is required in areas of intensive farming.
[7]: The chemistry of surface waters and groundwater draining agricultural catchments in the north-central and northwestern areas of Sri Lanka is described. Hydrochemical data from 296 water samples are used to evaluate water quality and to identify the processes that control nitrate and phosphate concentrations in the water. The results indicate that nutrient concentrations in the groundwaters are greater than those in the surface waters. Increased nutrient levels were observed in groundwater in a selected area in the fortnight following fertilizer application. Detailed geochemical investigations of selected groundwater samples reveal a gradual rise of nitrate-N and other solutes along the horizontal flow direction. Compared to the application rates of fertilizer in the area, the average nutrient concentrations in all waters are relatively low (1.5 mg/l nitrate and 0.5 mg/l phosphate) and stable. The results suggest that prevailing reducing conditions, iron-rich overburden soil cover and manmade canal networks control nutrient accumulation in the groundwater. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.
[12]: Nitrate is commonly used as an environmental indicator to trace the impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater. Hence, a survey was made of the nitrate concentrations in the groundwater of a shallow aquifer in Kathmandu valley from 90 wells, including shallow tube wells, dug wells and stone spouts (locally called dhunge dharas). The aims of this study are to describe the current status and trends of the nitrate contamination in different sources of shallow goundwater systems and to provide a sound, scientific understanding of the natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the nitrate contamination. The study indicates 16% of the sampled wells exceeded World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines of 10 mg/L of nitrate-nitrogen; however, another 33% wells have impacted levels of nitrate, i.e. between 2 and 10 mg/L. Although, nitrate contamination is widespread in shallow groundwater systems of Kathmandu, its concentration depends on depth of water table, well types and land use. Copyright © 2009 IAHS Press.
[13]: An investigation was carried out to evaluate the geochemical processes regulating groundwater quality in a coastal region, Barka, Sultanate of Oman. The rapid urban developments in Barka cause depletion of groundwater quantity and deterioration of quality through excessive consumption and influx of pollutants from natural and anthropogenic activities. In this study, 111 groundwater samples were collected from 79 wells and analysed for pH, EC, DO, temperature, major ions, silica and nutrients. In Barka, water chemistry shows large variation in major ion concentrations and in electrical conductivity, and implies the influence of distinguished contamination sources and hydrogeochemical processes. The groundwater chemistry in Barka is principally regulated by saline sources, reverse ion exchange, anthropogenic pollutants and mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions. Due to ubiquitous pollutants and processes, groundwater samples were classified into two groups based on electrical conductivity. In group1, water chemistry is greatly influenced by mineral dissolution/precipitation process and lateral recharge from upstream region (Jabal Al-Akdar and Nakhal mountains). In group 2, the water chemistry is affected by saline water intrusion, sea spray, reverse ion exchange and anthropogenic pollutants. Besides, high nitrate concentrations, especially in group 2 samples, firm evidence for impact of anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality, and nitrate can be originated by the effluents recharge from surface contamination sources. Ionic ratios such as SO<inf>4</inf>/Cl, alkalinity/Cl and total cation/Cl indicate that effluents recharged from septic tank, waste dumping sites and irrigation return flow induce dissolution of carbonate minerals, and enhances solute load in groundwater. The chemical constituents originating from saline water sources, reverse ion exchange and mineral dissolution are successfully differentiated using ionic delta, the difference between the actual concentration of each constituent and its theoretical concentration for a freshwater-seawater mix calculated from the chloride concentration of the sample, and proved that this approach is a promising tool to identify and differentiate the geochemical processes in coastal region. Hence, both regular geochemical methods and ionic delta ensured that groundwater quality in Barka is impaired by natural and human activities. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Entailment

Dietary patterns that reduce systemic inflammation, such as the Mediterranean diet, may help manage HS by lowering these markers .","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic disabling inflammatory disease of the follicular unit especially affecting apocrine gland-bearing skin areas. Little is known about systemic inflammatory complications of the disease. This study aimed to evaluate systemic inflammation in patients with HS by assessing serum amyloid A protein (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and to identify potential risk factors for HS. Forty-four patients (M/F: 28/16) and 44 age- and sex-matched controls (M/F: 28/16) were enrolled. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and therapeutic data, including smoking status, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), serum fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose, SAA, and CRP levels, and ESR were assessed. Associations were investigated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients with HS showed significantly higher levels of pack-years of cigarette smoking, weight, BMI, and WC (P = 0.01, P < 0.001, P = 0.001) and elevated SAA and CRP levels and ESR (P = 0.008, P = 0.01 and P < 0.001). SAA and CRP levels and ESR were significantly associated with Hurley staging in patients with HS (P = 0.03, P = 0.003, P = 0.02). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that each unit increase in the ESR increased the HS risk by 1.08-fold (95% CI 1.02–1.13). HS is significantly associated with SAA, CRP, and ESR. Among these inflammatory parameters, ESR was an independent risk factor for HS. We recommend assessment of SAA, CRP, and ESR as biomarkers that reflect the disease severity in HS patients likely to develop complications.
[5]: Oxidative stress and inflammation are underlying factors in the pathogenesis of chronic diseases. The postprandial state is characterized by low-grade oxidative and inflammatory responses, but the impact of different dietary patterns on these responses is unclear. The objective of this study was to investigate postprandial oxidative and inflammatory responses to Mediterranean diet (MED) and Western diet (WD) meals. In a randomised crossover design, eleven healthy women, aged between 19-45 years with a body mass index of 20.0-24.9 kg/m2, consumed two different isocaloric meals: MED and WD. Blood samples were collected at fasting and 2, 3, 4 h postprandially and analyzed for oxidative [total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), total thiol, native thiol, malondialdehyde (MDA)] and inflammatory [high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-17, IL-23, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)] markers. MED meal intake resulted in increases in TAS (0.05±0.02 mmol/L; p=0.017), total thiol (23.00±7.69 μmol/L; p=0.013) and native thiol (12.82±4.94 μmol/L; p=0.027), while a decrease in MDA (-0.17±0.06 nmol/L; p=0.022) at 2 h. On the other hand, TAS reduced significantly overall (p=0.005) after WD meal intake. There was a significant increase after WD meal intake for IL-6 (1.39±0.49 pg/mL; p=0.017), IL-17 (4.30±1.50 pg/mL; p=0.017), IL-23 (8.38±3.51 pg/mL; p=0.038) at 4 h. However, serum hs-CRP, TNF-α and NF-κB levels were not changed significantly by meal intake. The results indicate that MED meal induces favorable effects on oxidative stress, while WD meal partially increases inflammation in daily life.",Entailment
s_1074,Contradiction,"3. Reduction of Adverse Effects Lower Energy Requirements: Nanomaterials can help in reducing the linear endovenous energy density (LEED) required for effective ablation. For example, using a 1470-nm diode laser with radial fibers, which can be enhanced with nanomaterials, significantly minimized adverse effects such as ecchymosis and bruising compared to bare fibers . This reduction in energy requirements can lead to fewer side effects and a more comfortable recovery for patients.","Background: Endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) is one of the most accepted treatment options for varicose veins. In previous studies conducted with a laser at 810 to 1320 nm, paresthesia, pain, and ecchymosis were common adverse effects. We hypothesized that a lower linear endovenous energy density (LEED), as used with 1470-nm diode laser fibers, would lead to a reduction in adverse events. Methods: We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized observational cohort study of 312 consecutively treated lower limbs legs in 286 patients. Of these, a bare laser fiber (ELVeS-plus kit) was used to treat 168 legs in 150 patients (group 1), and a radial fiber (ELVeS-radial kit) was used in 144 legs in 136 patients (group 2). Laser treatment was performed in the great saphenous vein. Follow-up for all patients was 3 months. The primary end point was the occurrence of ecchymosis and bruising. This was correlated to the reduced LEED needed with the 1470-nm diode laser. Results: Laser fiber (odds ratio [OR], 22.3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 20.2-24.5) and body mass index (OR, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.15-0.55) were identified as independent parameters for LEED. In group 2 compared with group 1, LEED in the great saphenous vein could be reduced from 79.4 ± 9.1 to 57.4 ± 10 J/cm (P < .0001). LEED was an independent parameter for skin bleeding (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.017-1.058). Ecchymosis and bruising were significantly less frequent in group 2 than in group 1 (P < .0001). The need for analgesia was low, with 103.08 ± 15.34 mg diclofenac-sodium in group 1 vs 82.08 ± 18.86 mg in group 2 (P < .04). Occlusion with elimination of reflux was achieved in 100% of group 1 and group 2 (P < 1). No recanalization occurred at follow-up.

A continuously metallurgic transition is very important for industrial applications, such as joint structures of spaceframe constructions in transport industry. In this project, 'compound casting' of light metals is investigated, aiming at weight-saving. The substrate used is a wrought aluminium alloy of type AA5xxx, containing magnesium as main alloying element. The melts are aluminium alloys, containing various alloying elements (Cu, Si, Zn), and magnesium. By replacing the natural oxygen layer with a zinc layer, the inherent wetting difficulties were avoided, and compounds with flawless interfaces were successfully produced (no contraction defects, cracks or oxides). Electron microscopy and EDX investigations as well as optical micrographs of the interfacial areas revealed their continuously metallic constitution. Diffusion of alloying elements leads to heat-treatable microstructures in the vicinity of the joining interfaces in Al-Al couples. This permits significant variability of mechanical properties.

The use of nanotechnology in effluent, water, and soil clean-up applications largely makes use of the enhanced reactivity, surface area, and/or enhanced mobility of nanoparticles. Serious concerns have, however, been raised concerning the health implications of widespread nanoparticle use and release, deriving largely from the small size, and high reactivity and potential mobility (in both environmental and biological systems) of engineered nanoparticles. There are also serious cost issues related to bulk use of many novel nanomaterials, and questions over the scalability of treatment processes. This chapter discusses current applications of nanotechnology relevant to the treatment of agricultural and food production wastes and effluents, and outlines recent research on nanocomposites and nanostructured materials aimed at producing scalable, low-cost, and nontoxic devices for effluent and water treatment and land remediation and regeneration.

The potential advantages of the nanocomposite approach are discussed and evaluated, and the potential for wider application of these and similar devices in effluent, waste and water treatment, and land management, critically evaluated.

This combination helps in reducing bone turnover and preventing further deterioration of bone microarchitecture .","Until recently, calcium supplementation with vitamin D and hormone replacement therapy were the mainstays of treating osteoporosis associated with the menopause. Hormone replacement therapy, indeed, was (and is) effective in preventing fracture, but is no longer to be considered to be a primary indication for this purpose. Thus, while continuing with calcium and vitamin D, drug therapy now consists of the antiresorptive agents: raloxifene, calcitonin, and the bisphosphonates. These drugs reduce bone turnover, and do prevent fractures, but are limited to halting further deterioration of skeletal microarchitecture. The newest agent against osteoporosis is teriparatide, an amino terminal fragment parathyroid hormone containing 34 amino acids. PTH(1-34), or teriparatide, exhibits many of the classical actions of the whole molecule. It is anabolic with respect to bone when used according to well-defined protocols.

[9]: Background: Osteoporotic patients with insufficient calcium intake and/or vitamin D insufficiency need adequate calcium and vitamin D supplementation with their bisphosphonate treatment. However, consistent intake and, therefore, the effectiveness of calcium/vitamin D supplementation may be impaired by several factors in the individual patient: low prescription rate or lack of advice to purchase calcium/vitamin D; reduced compliance because of the complexity of the regimen; or incorrect intake. There is a need to provide patients with a better way of taking bisphosphonate treatment with their calcium/vitamin D supplementation. To this end, a fixed-combination pack to help patients take the combination of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D correctly and regularly has been developed. Objective: To evaluate patients' understanding of administration instructions, preferences and their perceptions of compliance, convenience and completeness of a fixed-combination pack of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D compared with those associated with separate packs. Methods: The new monthly fixed-combination pack of bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D contains four weekly boxes. Each box contains a blister pack with one swallowable risedronate 35mg film-coated tablet and six sachets of calcium/vitamin D effervescent granules (calcium 1000mg and vitamin D3 [colecalciferol] 880 IU) for dissolution in water as an oral solution, together constituting 1 week of therapy, accompanied by a patient information leaflet. Two quantitative patient research survey studies were conducted using standard questionnaires in face-to-face interviews with 400 postmenopausal women in several French cities. Participants were given the combined pack and two separate packs (risedronate 35mg once weekly and calcium/vitamin D effervescent granules in sachets). In the first study, participants' understanding of administration instructions and preferences were evaluated. In the second study, participants' perception of compliance, convenience and completeness of the new combination pack of risedronate 35mg plus calcium/vitamin D compared with two separate packs were evaluated. Results: Participants asked about the combined pack answered a significantly higher proportion of questions about intake instructions correctly (80.3%) than participants asked about the two separate packs (70.7%) [p= 0.0004]. The combined pack was preferred by 72% of participants (p < 0.0001) for several reasons. Compared with separate packs, the combined pack was considered easier to use by 63% and easier to remember to use by 67% of participants. Participants believed that use of the combined pack would be more likely to help them take their bisphosphonate regularly (66%) and correctly (67%), and to take their calcium/vitamin D supplementation more regularly and correctly (68%), than use of separate packs. Seventy percent of participants believed that use of the combination pack would help them to not forget to take calcium/vitamin D supplementation. Conclusion: Use of the fixed-combination pack of risedronate 35 mg plus calcium/vitamin D once weekly could increase the likelihood that postmenopausal osteoporotic patients will receive a complete bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D therapy course and is likely to enhance correct intake of combination therapy. Use of this fixed-combination product will provide patients with a tool for improving adherence to recommended osteoporosis therapy and optimize the effectiveness of such treatment. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV.

[10]: Osteoporosis and fragility fractures associated with osteoporosis are the causes of increases in morbidity, disability and mortality, with important consequences for healthcare costs. Hence, osteoporosis therapy has been demonstrated as effective in lowering both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk and mortality. Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis can be divided into two categories: antiresorptive and anabolic agents. Antiresorptive drugs suppress bone resorption and are the most commonly used agents. Anabolic agents, on the other hand, stimulate bone formation and represent a more recent therapeutic approach to osteoporosis treatment. Moreover, among therapeutic interventions, an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is widely and strongly recommended, representing an essential part of any treatment regimen.

Policymakers' reluctance to provide technology-specific support further hinders progress .","Despite seemingly favourable conditions for alternative road-based transport technologies, progress on battery electric vehicles (BEVs) have been slow in Stockholm. We investigate why, applying the multilevel perspective for socio-technical transitions to a local case study of Stockholm. Using in-depth interviews with key actors we trace processes and discuss possible explanations at niche, regime and landscape levels. The results show that niche developments are clearly lacking, resulting in limited experience and knowledge of BEVs, and enduring conceptions among both policymakers and consumers. Regime actors are also ambivalent towards BEVs, leading to limited regime action with for example car companies moving more to Plugin Hybrid Electric Vehicles instead of BEVs. Finally, there is uncertainty as a result of a lack of strong policy signals for BEVs, in turn driven by policy makers' aversion against technology-specific support. We outline what governance gaps need to be addressed to induce faster progress on BEV uptake.",Entity error

[2]: Sea urchins play a crucial role in the health and dynamics of reef ecosystems. Diadema mexicanum is a dominant grazer and erosive agent of the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific. Its reported distribution extends from the middle of the Gulf of California (26° N) to northern Peru (6°23′ S), including oceanic islands. Here, we report the occurrence of Diadema mexicanum in Isla San Jorge (31°0′38.53″ N, 113°14′34.84″ W), the northernmost island in the Gulf of California, which extends its range an additional 600 km northward. Sea urchins, ranging in test size from 4.5 to 12.4 cm, were present at 2–6 m in October 2015. This test size was one of the largest reported for this species in the eastern tropical Pacific. Spine length in sea urchins in the upper gulf ranged from 3.3 to 15.6 cm. Variation in body size of sea urchin may reflect variation in more structurally complex reefs from isolated islands that provide shelter from predation. The reef structure of Isla San Jorge is formed by high coral cover of the scleractinian coral Porites panamensis, with an average colony height of 26.27 cm (standard error, SE ±1.58, n = 60), similar to coral reef communities of the southern Gulf of California. Although D. mexicanum is considered a great force of erosion to the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific, no evidence of erosion was observed at Isla San Jorge, indicating a balanced dynamic between herbivores, macroalgae, and corals.",Opposite meaning

A concept that minimizes the environmental impact of the products created, through such choice of components and design that will allow them to be reused. Speaking of circular economy, it is impossible not to mention the role of alternative fuels. According to the EN-15359: 2005 standard - Solid recovered fuels. Specification and classes, alternative fuels are flammable wastes, defragmented, homogeneous mixtures, produced by mixing non-hazardous waste, with or without solid fuel, liquid fuel or biomass, and which, as a result of thermal transformation, do not cause emissions to exceed the limits set out in Ordinance of the Minister of the Environment on the standards of emission from the installations dealing with the process of co-incineration of waste. [3] Development of the alternative fuels market, regardless of technology, should be seen as desirable. The preparation of individual technologies for entering the fuel market is, however, most varied. In addition, a series of studies need be conducted to answer questions on the suitability and potential for using alternative fuels as a source of energy. The article presents the issues of the circular economy package and alternative fuels.
[16]: The Sustainable Development Agenda 2030 proposed 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in which the SDG 11 promotes inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable cities and human settlements; SDG 7 encourages efforts to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all and SDG 12 ensures sustainable consumption and production patterns. For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them. A matrix has been developed between the ReSOLVE framework and the opportunities of CE in cities. The SCM has increased the pace of transition, yet the recommendations are given to implement the CE principles efficiently.",Entailment

The objective of this study is to determine the antibiotic resistance rates against first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections in elderly patients at our hospital, and use the results as guidance for empirical antibiotic therapy. Methods: In this study, data on all elderly patients aged 65 and older who were followed and treated in our hospital between March 2010 and March 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: 406 microorganisms were isolated from the urine cultures of 401 patients included in the study, because 5 (1.2%) patients harbored two microorganisms. Of the 406 microorganisms, 320 (78.8%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 72 (17.7%) were Gram-positive cocci and 14 (3.5%) were Candida spp. Escherich-ia coli (n=262, 64.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=27, 6.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=17, 4.1%) were the most common among Gram-negatives, and Enterococcus faecalis (n=36, 8.9%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=25, 6.2%) were the most common among Gram-positives. Susceptibility rates of E. coli strains were 89% for nitrofurantoin, 81% for trime-thoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 77% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 70% for gentamicin and 66% for ciprofoxacin. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance must be monitored at each hospital in order to make correct choices for empirical antibiotic therapy. Surveillance studies are helpful for this purpose.

[5]: Objectives: Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections encountered in the Emergency Department (ED). Objectives of this study are to describe the urological pathogens associated with UTIs in the ED, report antibiotic susceptibilities, and assess empiric antibiotic treatment. Methods: A retrospective chart review of 154 patients with positive urine cultures from January to June 2016 were reviewed for inclusion in the study. Patients were excluded if less than 18 years of age, hospitalized, discharged from the ED without antibiotics or diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Patient demographics, uropathogens isolated, in-vitro susceptibility to commonly prescribed oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and antibiotics selected for treatment were recorded. Results: One hundred patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 106 bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Group B Streptococcus accounted for 62.5%, 8%, and 8% of pathogens, respectively. Overall susceptibilities were 88.1%, 87.9%, 85.4%, and 70.6% for nitrofurantoin, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to nitrofurantoin at 96.9% followed by cefazolin at 94%. Ciprofloxacin was the most prescribed antibiotic followed by cephalexin, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Conclusions: Based on bacterial susceptibility patterns, nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are reasonable first line agents in the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections identified in the emergency department. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was ciprofloxacin, highlighting the importance of implementing antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and designing specific tools and educational programs for the emergency department targeted at minimizing fluoroquinolone use.

Options for initial treatment of pyelonephritis or UTI requiring hospitalization include levofloxacin (LVF) or extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Globally, uropathogenic Escherichia coli resistance rates to fluoroquinolones have increased in recent years. Objective To compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving ceftriaxone (CTX) to those who received LVF empirically for the treatment of E. coli UTI. Setting 433-bed community hospital in Lexington, KY. Methods Retrospective, single center, cohort study of adults with a urine culture positive for E. coli who received either IV LVF or CTX empirically for the treatment of UTI. Main outcome measure The primary outcome was hospital length of stay. Secondary outcomes include time to susceptible therapy (TsT), hospital cost, and susceptibility to empiric therapy. Results There was no statistically significant difference in LOS or hospital cost. Subgroup analysis compared patients that received concordant CTX treatment and patients that received discordant LVF treatment. Patients that received concordant CTX treatment had a nonsignificant shorter median LOS (4.16 vs. 6.34 days). Median hospital cost was lower ($4345 vs. $8462, p = 0.004) and median TsT was shorter (5.83 vs. 64.46 h, p OpenSPiltSPi 0.001) in the concordant CTX group.

For its management, a fine morphological study of the testis, both macroscopically and microscopically, and an accurate choice of surgical procedure are mandatory. The present review focuses its attention on the anatomic substrates of adolescent varicocele and its pathophysiologic modifications. The comprehensive assessment of all the reported alterations should be considered by the clinician before deciding the type of treatment and the timing. © 2013 Giuseppe Santoro and Carmelo Romeo.
[6]: Background: Varicocele is a common urologic anomaly in adolescent males; however, evidence-based treatment guidelines do not exist. Hydroceles are known to be a common complication after surgical therapy, with a wide variation in the reported incidence between 1 and 40%. Aim: This study aimed to introduce a standardized indication-to-treat protocol and prove its efficacy by analyzing the outcome of patients. Secondly, it aimed to better define postoperative hydroceles because the wide variation of reported incidence is attributed to a lack of definition. Methods: Our standardized treatment protocol included an initial assessment with clinical grading of varicoceles, ultrasound evaluation of testicular volume, and calculation of the atrophy index. Indications for surgical treatment were testicular volume asymmetry >20%, discomfort and pain, or bilateral varicocele. The Palomo procedure (laparoscopically since 2005) was the standard procedure. Postoperative hydroceles were graded according to clinical findings and symptoms: Grade I, sonographic chance finding without clinical correlate; Grade II, palpable but clinically insignificant; Grade III, symptomatic. All patients treated according to the defined protocol were prospectively monitored between January 2001 and December 2015. Results: A total of 129 patients with left varicocele were referred to our institution; 70 fulfilled the indication criteria for surgical treatment. Twenty-eight of these patients were treated for volume asymmetry, 26 of these showed catch-up growth. Forty-two patients were treated for discomfort and pain; the symptoms subsided in all of them. Postoperative hydroceles were detected in 36 patients (51%). In 29 patients this was a sonographic chance finding (Grade I). Three patients showed a palpable but clinically insignificant postoperative hydrocele (Grade II) and four patients (5.7%) showed symptomatic hydrocele (Grade III) where treatment was recommended. Discussion: The treatment protocol allowed judicious indication for surgery and postoperative outcomes similar to previous reports. The high rate of catch-up growth in operated cases represents a proxy for successful treatment in cases where more precise parameters, like semen quality or paternity rate, were not yet detectable. The introduced grading system for postoperative hydroceles provs to be a valid and appropriate instrument, and promises to be a standardized method for comparing outcomes in future studies. Conclusion: The indication-to-treat protocol proved to be easily applicable, highly efficient, and have outcomes comparable to international literature. The necessity for a standardized grading of postoperative hydroceles was underscored in the data.

The CXCR3 chemokine receptor supports migration of tumor cells to metastatic sites, but its role in ovarian cancer metastasis is largely unknown. Herein, we first screened two independent cohorts of high-grade serous ovarian cancers (HGSCs, discovery set n = 60, validation set n = 117) and 102 metastatic lesions for CXCR3 expression. In primary tumors, CXCR3 was particularly overexpressed by tumor cells at the invasive front. In intraabdominal metastases, tumor cells revealed a strong CXCR3 expression regardless of its expression in the corresponding primary tumor, suggesting a selection of CXCR3- overexpressing cancer cells into peritoneal niches. In support of this, CXCR3 mediated the migration of tumor cell lines OVCAR3 and SKOV3 toward malignant ascites, which was inhibited by a monoclonal anti-CXCR3 antibody in vitro. These results were prospectively validated in ascites-derived tumor cells from EOC patients ex vivo (n = 9). Moreover, tumor cell-associated overexpression of CXCR3 in advanced ovarian cancer patients was associated with a reduced progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), which remained independent of optimal debulking, age, FIGO stage and lymph node involvement (PFS: hazard ratio (HR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.30-3.45, P = 0.003; OS: HR 2.36, 95% CI 1.50-3.71, Po0.001).

In this context, among the topics that need to be better understood are the changes in the water-related processes and gas exchange properties of plants grown under these conditions. Notably, the effects of climate change on coffee (Coffea spp.) production are particularly concerning given the importance of this commodity. Especially, it has been reported that coffee trees exhibit better photosynthetic efficiency when grown at higher [CO<inf>2</inf>] levels. In order to elucidate the mechanisms involved with this response, the seasonality of water-related processes, gas exchange, and carbohydrate metabolism were investigated using C. arabica var. Red Catuaí grown at ambient and high [CO<inf>2</inf>] under field conditions, at a free-air CO<inf>2</inf> enrichment (FACE) facility for coffee, in Brazil. The trees were evaluated fortnightly, from November to February (hot and rainy—summer) and from June to September (cold and dry—winter). It was found that C. arabica trees grown under high [CO<inf>2</inf>] conditions exhibited increased photosynthetic rates (averaging 121% higher in summer and 45% higher in winter) in both seasons, without displaying any significant changes in the seasonal photosynthesis pattern. Additionally, there was a tendency for the coffee trees grown at high [CO<inf>2</inf>] to exhibit increased levels of soluble carbohydrates, organic acids, and amino acids in the leaves. Our findings suggest that coffee trees adapt to increased [CO<inf>2</inf>] through increased photosynthetic rates, enhanced stomatal conductance regulation, and augmented carbohydrate and organic acid synthesis. It is plausible that these features could help mitigate the effects caused by climate change.",Opposite meaning

One study reported phosphorus removal efficiencies of 72.98% in an up-flow aerobic/anoxic sludge fixed film bioreactor .,"The performance of two bench scale activated sludge reactors with two feeding regimes, continuous fed (an up-flow aerobic/anoxic sludge fixed film (UAASFF) bioreactor) and batch fed (sequencing batch reactor (SBR)) with intermittent aeration, were evaluated for simultaneous nutrients (N, P) removal. Three significant variables (retention/reaction time, chemical oxygen demand (COD): N (nitrogen): P (phosphorus) ratio and aeration time) were selected for modeling, analyzing, and optimizing the process. At high retention time (≥6 h), two bioreactors showed comparable removal efficiencies, but at lower hydraulic retention time, the UAASFF bioreactor showed a better performance with higher nutrient removal efficiency than the SBR. The experimental results indicated that the total Kjeldahl nitrogen removal efficiency in the UAASFF increased from 70.84% to 79.2% when compared to SBR. It was also found that the COD removal efficiencies of both processes were over 87%, and total nitrogen and total phosphorus removal efficiencies were 79.2% and 72.98% in UAASFF, and 71.2% and 68.9% in SBR, respectively.",Entailment

The phase of clay mining (65.8%) is significantly impacting on all the investigated impact categories followed by brick moulding (24.8%) and brick roasting (9.4%) phases, respectively. Hotspots were assessed to identify potential for resource efficiency and circular economy at ABC bricks, Zimbabwe. It can be concluded that ABC is severely polluting the air with emissions above the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) standards for SO<inf>2</inf>, CO, PM and NO<inf>x</inf> thus putting kiln workers at risk of respiratory diseases. The calculated Air Quality Index (AQI) ranks CO as the most affecting pollutant with an average score of ∼600. Clay production efficiency was also determined, and an analysis revealed that extrusion and clamping stage contributed highly to the clay losses during brick moulding. Therefore, focus must be placed on these process steps to reduce raw material losses. Furthermore, an environmental waste (fly ash) was used in different weight percentage ratios of 10%, 20% and 100% to substitute clay. The increase of the fly ash content in the brick making process proved to significantly reduce the environmental load among the selected impact categories. ABC uses clay as its main raw material hence the high demand for clay. Strategies should include accounting of used clay daily and raw materials substitution. If ABC uses fly ash from its brick kilns and from other thermal power plant boilers to mix with clay in brick production, then the quantity of clay demanded will be reduced. Using fly ash will reduce rate of clay extraction while at the same time solving the problem of fly ash disposal in Zimbabwe. This circular option will ultimately result in reduced pit expansion, hence reducing top-soil loss and environmental degradation. It should not be disregarded that top-soil loss in turn affects food security. By adopting appropriate technologies, implementing resource efficiency, and designing circular economy patterns, the brick manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe may not only reduce production waste but also comply with enforced environmental protection legislation.",Entailment

Methods: We designed and performed this study to determine whether exosomes attenuate the lesion size of SCI by ameliorating neuronal injury induced by a secondary inflammatory storm and promoting neurite outgrowth. We determined the absolute levels of all exosomal miRNAs and investigated the potential mechanisms of action of miR-199a-3p/145-5p in inducing neurite outgrowth in vivo and in vitro. Results: miR-199a-3p/145-5p, which are relatively highly expressed miRNAs in exosomes, promoted PC12 cell differentiation suppressed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro through modulation of the NGF/TrkA pathway. We also demonstrated that Cblb was a direct target of miR-199a-3p and that Cbl was a direct target of miR-145-5p. Cblb and Cbl gene knockdown resulted in significantly decreased TrkA ubiquitination levels, subsequently activating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Conversely, overexpression of Cblb and Cbl was associated with significantly increased TrkA ubiquitination level, subsequently inactivating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the direct interaction between TrkA and Cblb and TrkA and Cbl. In an in vivo experiment, exosomal miR-199a-3p/145-5p was found to upregulate TrkA expression at the lesion site and also promote locomotor function in SCI rats. Conclusions: In summary, our study showed that exosomes transferring miR-199a-3p/145-5p into neurons in SCI rats affected TrkA ubiquitination and promoted the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway, indicating that hUC-MSC-derived exosomes may be a promising treatment strategy for SCI.",Entailment

To allow fast reactions, for instance to predator attacks, these collective structures require behavioural mechanisms authorizing fast, coordinated movements.

Emotional intelligence, the ability to comprehend, use, and regulate emotions is often reckoned as a critical component of human intelligence, and is useful for optimizing human-human interaction. A recent influx of proactive devices and environments has made human-machine interfaces ubiquitous. With the interaction of humans amongst themselves as the blueprint for interaction between humans and machines, there is a growing need to induce emotional intelligence in the latter to regulate the interaction and enhance user experience. Communication among humans is supplemented by their innate capacity to infer the emotional state of the interlocutor with affective signals manifested with physical correlates of emotion such as facial expressions (FEs), speech, and voice inflections. Rigorous experiments in face-to-face multimodal cognition suggested FEs to be more predominant as compared to other modalities in conveying the underlying emotional state. Therefore, conventional human-machine interfaces that ignore or marginalize the user's FEs fail to procure and access a relevant segment of information present in the conversation signals. This has necessitated a paradigm shift in human-machine interaction with incorporation of FEs as a communication channel. A proactive affect-sensitive interface, able to regulate human-machine interaction in accordance with affective state of the user, has multitudinous prospective applications in a wide array of domains. This has lent a powerful impetus to assessment of emotions by FEs, an integral component of non-verbal paralinguistic communication. Motivated with the need of inducing emotional intelligence in machines, several models for representing affective facial displays have been introduced in the past. This chapter presents a systematic overview of diverse characteristic patterns presented for reliable analysis of emotional facial displays. The manifestation of emotions via FEs entails a non-rigid motion of facial features that can be embodied by a dense optical flow field, which is the apparent image motion in a time-progressing visual. The dearth of a detailed corpora pertaining specifically to the theme of visual information-based recognition of facial expressions with optical flow has motivated us to articulate various studies concerning this subject.

Previous research has relied on incorporating metadata information in various application domains using deep learning techniques to achieve better recommendation accuracy. The use of metadata is desirable to address the cold start problem and better learning the user-item interaction, which is not captured by the user-item rating matrix. Existing methods rely on fixed user-item latent representation and ignore the metadata information. It restricts the model performance to correctly identify actual latent vectors, which results in high rating prediction error. To tackle these problems, we propose a generalized recommendation model named Meta Embedding Deep Collaborative Filtering (MEDCF), which inputs user demographics and item genre as metadata features together with the rating matrix. The proposed framework primarily comprises of Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Neural Matrix Factorization (NeuMF) methods. GMF is applied to the rating matrix, whereas MLP is applied to metadata. Using NeuMF, the outputs for GMF and MLP are then concatenated and input to a neural network for rating prediction. To prove the effectiveness of proposed model, two metrics are used, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The MEDCF model is experimented on MovieLens and Amazon Movies datasets showing a significant improvement over the baseline methods.

DeepProbe can rephrase, evaluate, and even actively ask questions, leveraging the generative ability and likelihood estimation made possible by seq2seq models. DeepProbe makes decisions based on a derived uncertainty (entropy) measure conditioned on user inputs, possibly with multiple rounds of interactions. Three applications, namely a rewritter, a relevance scorer and a chatbot for ad recommendation, were built around DeepProbe, with the first two serving as precursory building blocks for the third. We first use the seq2seq model in DeepProbe to rewrite a user query into one of standard query form, which is submitted to an ordinary recommendation system. Secondly, we evaluate DeepProbe's seq2seq model-based relevance scoring. Finally, we build a chatbot prototype capable of making active user interactions, which can ask questions that maximize information gain, allowing for a more efficient user intention idenfication process. We evaluate first two applications by 1) comparing with baselines by BLEU and AUC, and 2) human judge evaluation. Both demonstrate significant improvements compared with current state-of-the-art systems, proving their values as useful tools on their own, and at the same time laying a good foundation for the ongoing chatbot application.",Entailment

While previous monoclonal antibodies against the IL-5 ligand resulted in inconsistent improvements in asthma outcomes, benralizumab has shown promise. Benralizumab is a monoclonal antibody against IL-5 receptor, and has an enhanced antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity function. In this article, we review the theoretical advantages of benralizumab compared to previous compounds, as well as current status of the clinical development of benralizumab in asthma. Lastly, we briefly discuss the potential role of benralizumab in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",Related but unverifiable

This study0020was, therefore, conducted during 2010-2012 in a Malaysia oil palm plantation to characterize oil palm weed communities and evaluate oil palm yield under four different perennial cover-crop systems. Experimental treatments included four different cover crop combinations such as Axonopus compressus, Calopogonium caeruleum + Centrosema pubescens, Mucuna bracteata, Pueraria javanica + Centrosema pubescens, and herbicidal control by glufosinate-ammonium and weedy control. Weed composition in the un-weeded treatment was different from that of cover crop treatments. The un-weeded treatment favored Paspalum conjugatum and A. compressus as the dominant species. In the A. compressus and C. caeruleum + C. pubescens treatments the associated weed species with highest dominance was Asystasia gangetica, while the weeds A. compressus and A. gangetica were associated with M. bracteata and P. javanica + C. pubescens treatments. In the weeded treatment receiving 6 sprays of glufosinateammonium over the two years, B. latifolia was dominant. The A. compressus cover treatment had the lowest species richness and diversity. Weeded plots had lowest yield, bunch number tree<sup>-1</sup> and bunch weight during the 18-24 MAP. The study confirms variation in weed community in oil palm plantation under different cover-crop systems and thus, contributes to improving current understanding of weed community structures and may help formulate sustainable weed management strategy for oil palm plantation. © 2014 Friends Science Publishers.",Missing information

[11]: Background: Pregnancy anemia remains as a public health problem, since the official reports in the 70's. To guide the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy, the haemoglobin concentration is the most used test in spite of its low accuracy, and serum ferritin is the most reliable test, although its cutoff point remains an issue. Methods/design: The aim of this protocol is to verify the accuracy of erythrocyte indices and serum ferritin (studied tests) for the diagnosis of functional iron-deficiency in pregnancy using the iron-therapy responsiveness as the gold-standard. This is an ongoing phase III accuracy study initiated in August 2011 and to be concluded in April 2013. The subjects are anemic pregnant women (haemoglobin concentration < 11.0 g/dL) attended at a low-risk prenatal care center in the Northeast of Brazil. The sample size (n 278) was calculated to estimate sensitivity of 90% and 80% of specificity with relative error of 10% and power of 95%. This study has a prospective design with a before-after intervention of 80 mg of daily oral iron during 90 days and will be analyzed as a delayed-type cross-sectional study. Women at the second trimester of pregnancy are being evaluated with clinical and laboratorial examinations at the enrollment and monthly. The 'responsiveness to therapeutic test with oral iron' (gold-standard) was defined to an increase of at least 0.55 Z-score in haemoglobin after 4 weeks of treatment and a total dose of 1200 mg of iron. At the study conclusion, sensitivities, specificities, predictive values, likelihood ratios and areas under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curves of serum ferritin and erythrocyte indices (red blood cell count, haematocrit, haemoglobin concentration, mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin, mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration, red blood cell distribution width, reticulocyte count) will be tested. The compliance and adverse effects are considered confounding variables, since they are the main obstacles for the iron-therapy responsiveness.Discussion: This study protocol shows a new approach on iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy from a functional point of view that could bring some insights about the diagnostic misclassifications arising from the dynamic physiologic changes during the gestational cycle.Trial registration: WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform U1111-1123-2605. © 2013 Bresani et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Related but unverifiable

The treatments were: fresh kelp (Ecklonia maxima) blades (seaweed control); Abfeed® (formulated feed control); kelp + Abfeed® dried kelp pellets; dried kelp blades; dried kelp stipes; fresh kelp with the epiphyte Carpoblepharis flaccida; a mixed diet (Gracilaria gracilis, Ulva lactuca, and kelp) and a rotational diet (abalone were fed 1 of the 9 treatments for the first week and them kelp for the next 3 weeks). Results show that abalone grow well on all fresh seaweed combinations, but grow best on a mixed diet.

Exploring the complex relationships between water environment and landscape background, and Chl a concentration in the reservoir bays are crucial for ensuring high-quality drinking water from reservoirs. In this study, we monitored Chl a concentrations of 66 bays in Danjiangkou Reservoir and the related water quality parameters (e.g., water temperature, turbidity, nutrients) in waterbodies of these reservoir bays in the storage and discharge periods from 2015 to 2018. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to quantify the relationship between water environmental factors and watershed landscapes, and Chl a concentrations in reservoir bays. The results showed that mean Chl a concentration was higher in storage period than that in discharge period. Two optimal PLS-SEMs explained 66.8% and 53.6% of Chl a concentration variation in the storage and discharge periods, respectively. The net effect of water chemistry on Chl a concentration was more pronounced during the discharge period (total effect = 0.61, 37% of the total effect on Chl a), while the net effect of land-use composition on Chl a concentration was more significant during the storage period (total effect = 0.57, 30% of the total effect on Chl a). The landscape pattern had significant indirect effects on Chl a concentration, especially during the discharge period (indirect effect = −0.31, 19% of the total effect on Chl a).

Previous anesthesia methods for hip replacement in elderly patients include general, lumbar puncture, or epidural anesthesia alone. A combined nerve block is more suitable for total hip replacement in the elderly because of the safety and reliability of the method. In this study, we hypothesized that a combined nerve block is superior to any previous anesthesia method alone for total hip replacement in the elderly. Specifically, we hypothesized that intraoperative stress, hemorheological indices, postoperative immune function, and incidence of postoperative complications would be more favorable using a combined nerve block compared with previous anesthesia methods. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of a combined nerve block on intraoperative stress and postoperative immune function in elderly patients subjected to total hip replacement. METHODS: This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled, open-label trial, which will be performed at Qingdao University Affiliated Hospital, China. A total of 120 elderly patients scheduled to undergo total hip replacement will be randomly assigned to undergo a combined nerve block (involving lower lumbar plexus, sciatic nerve, and paraspinal nerve L<inf>1-2</inf>) (experimental group, n=60), or general anesthesia (control group, n=60). All patients will be followed up for 3 months. The primary outcome will be serum cortisol concentration during surgery, as a measure of intraoperative stress. Secondary outcomes include serum cortisol concentration prior to anesthesia, and prior to and immediately after surgery; blood glucose level prior to anesthesia, and prior to, during, and after surgery, used to evaluate stress during different times. In addition, immune function-related indices including absolute leukocyte count, absolute neutrophil count, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-8, and T-lymphocyte subset levels prior to anesthesia, immediately after surgery, 1, 3, 7 days, and 3 months after surgery, will be used to evaluate patients' immune function after surgery. Hemorheological indices including electrocardiogram, pulse, systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, heart rate, blood gas analysis prior to anesthesia, and during and after surgery will be used to investigate changes in blood-related indices. Lastly, incidence of adverse events 1, 3, 7 days, and 3 months after surgery will be used to evaluate postoperative complications.

Rarefied species richness and Shannon's H′ varied unimodally with the distance offshore and depth for all taxa (except sea urchins) and were highest at intermediate distances offshore and depths. There was no significant association between evenness and distance offshore. Evenness did, however, vary with depth and exposure. Overall, models using distance offshore, depth and exposure explained most of the variation in sponge and coral diversity but substantially less variation in foraminifera diversity. Variation in composition depended on distance offshore, depth and exposure although the relative importance of these variables differed among taxa. Depth was the most important parameter for sponges, corals and foraminifera but not for sea urchins. Sponge and coral assemblages differed markedly from in-to-off-shore but there was relatively little variation in foraminifera assemblages with most foraminifera species having broad cross-shelf distributions. Foraminifera assemblages on the contrary differed markedly between exposed and sheltered reef environments; species in exposed reef environments, for example, consisted of species with distinct strategies for coping with the increased hydrodynamic energy. In summary, this study shows that benthic taxa in the Spermonde are distributed along continuous gradients (in-to-off-shore and shallow-to-deep) in addition to occupying discrete habitats related to reef exposure.
[4]: In order to preserve diversity it is essential to understand how assemblages change across space. Despite this fact, we still know very little about how marine diversity is spatially distributed, especially among lesser-studied invertebrate taxa. In the present study beta-diversity patterns of sea urchins, sponges, mushroom corals and larger foraminifera were assessed in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia). Using ordinations we showed that the inshore zone (<5 km offshore), midshore zone (5 < × < 30 km offshore) and distance offshore zone (<30 km offshore) all contained distinct assemblages of sponges and corals, while only foraminifera assemblages from the inshore (<5 km offshore) zone were distinct. There was a significant spatial pattern of community similarity for all taxa surveyed, but this pattern proved to be wholly related to environmental variables for sponges and foraminifera, and primarily for mushroom corals and sea urchins. The lack of a pure spatial component suggests that these taxa may not be dispersal limited within the spatial scales of this study (c. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>). The analyses of the corals and foraminifera were additionally tested at two spatial scales of sampling. Both taxa were primarily associated with local-scale environmental variables at the local scale and larger-scale variables at the larger scale. Mean inter-plot similarity was also higher and variation lower at the larger scale. The results suggest that substantial variation in similarity can be predicted using simple locally assessed environmental variables combined with remotely sensed parameters. © 2006 The Authors.

It poses risks such as heat-related illnesses, loss of habitat for species, and disruptions to food and water supplies .","Global warming is a serious threat to human existence. The relatively higher level of global warming in recent times poses higher health risks to humans, both directly and indirectly. The aim of the study was to investigate public knowledge of global warming and its effects on human health. A nationally representative survey of Ghanaian adults (N=1130) was conducted from November 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019. Results show that 84.4% of the respondents understood the meaning of global warming. Respondents' perceived causes of global warming include natural processes, deforestation, act of the gods, burning of fossil fuel, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from vehicles and industries. The majority of the respondents (83.4%) indicated that global warming has an impact on human health, while 8.5% indicated that it does not. Majority (78.6%) of the respondents are willing to support efforts to reduce the intensity of global warming. Television (19.1%) and social media (18.6%) were the leading preferred methods for receipt of global warming information. These findings provide useful insights for policy directions. The Government of Ghana and other stakeholders in health should develop a communication strategy to increase and sustain publicity and education of the citizenry on global warming.
[8]: Background: According to the World Health Organization, air pollution is closely associated with climate change and, in particular, with global warming. In addition to melting of ice and snow, rising sea level, and flooding of coastal areas, global warming is leading to a tropicalization of temperate marine ecosystems. Moreover, the effects of air pollution on airway and lung diseases are well documented as reported by the World Allergy Organization. Methods: Scientific literature was searched for studies investigating the effect of the interaction between air pollution and climate change on allergic and respiratory diseases. Results: Since 1990s, a multitude of articles and reviews have been published on this topic, with many studies confirming that the warming of our planet is caused by the ""greenhouse effect"" as a result of increased emission of ""greenhouse"" gases. Air pollution is also closely linked to global warming: the emission of hydrocarbon combustion products leads to increased concentrations of biological allergens such as pollens, generating a mixture of these particles called particulate matter (PM). The concept is that global warming is linked to the emission of hydrocarbon combustion products, since both carbon dioxide and heat increase pollen emission into the atmosphere, and all these particles make up PM10. However, the understanding of the mechanisms by which PM affects human health is still limited. Therefore, several studies are trying to determine the causes of global warming. There is also evidence that increased concentrations of air pollutants and pollens can activate inflammatory mediators in the airways. Our Task Force has prepared a Decalogue of rules addressing public administrators, which aims to limit the amount of allergenic pollen in the air without sacrificing public green areas. Conclusions: Several studies underscore the significant risks of global warming on human health due to increasing levels of air pollution. The impact of climate change on respiratory diseases appears well documented. The last decades have seen a rise in the concentrations of pollens and pollutants in the air. This rise parallels the increase in the number of people presenting with allergic symptoms (e.g., allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma), who often require emergency medical care. Our hope is that scientists from different disciplines will work together with institutions, pharmaceutical companies and lay organizations to limit the adverse health effects of air pollution and global warming.",Entailment
s_459,Contradiction,"Key Components of a Hypothesis Space: Scientific Method and Hypothesis Testing: The scientific method does not involve formulating, testing, or modifying hypotheses based on experimental data. This static process fails to refine the hypothesis space as it ignores new data and insights .","The general concept of the scientific method or procedure consists in systematic observation, experiment and measurement, and the formulation, testing and modification of hypotheses. In many cases a hypothesis is formulated in the form of a model, for example a mathematical or simulation model. The correctness of a solution of a problem produced by a model is verified by comparing it with collected data. Alternatively, observational data may be collected without a clear specification that the data could also apply to the solution of other, unforeseen problems. In such cases data analytics are used to extract relationships from and detect structures in data sets. In accordance with the scientific method, the results obtained can then be used to formulate one or more hypotheses and associated models as solutions for such problems. This approach allows for ensuring the validity of the solutions obtained. The results thus obtained may lead to a deeper insight in such problems and can represent significant progress in scientific research. The increased interest in so-called Big Data resulted in a growing tendency to consider the structures detected by analysing large data sets as solutions in their own right. A notion is thus developing that the scientific method is becoming obsolete. In this paper it is argued that data, hypotheses and models are essential to gain deeper insights into the nature of the problems considered and to ensure that plausible solutions were found. A further aspect to consider is that the processing of increasingly larger data sets result in an increased demand for HTC (High Throughput Computing) in contrast to HPC (High Performance Computing). The demand for HTC platforms will impact the future development of parallel computing platforms.",Opposite meaning

s_1605,Unverifiable,"Biological Control: Certain insects can be used to control specific weed species. For example, the water hyacinth weevil is effective against water hyacinth, and the weed flea beetle targets Alternanthera philoxeroides .","[9] Agriculture occupies an important place in improving the living standards of farmers in Pakistan. About 90% of farm earnings rely on the cultivation of sugar, fibre, cereals and legumes. Due to lack of essential resources and technical expertise, every year thousands of farmers fail to reach maximum yield potential. Over 70% of farmers own less than 5 ha in Pakistan; therefore, it is uneconomic to employ costly mechanical and chemical strategies for the control of pests in their crops. Among these pests, we eds are considered to be the major obstacle to crop production, and can ultimately result in crop failure. Traditionally, manipulation of cropping techniques was employed for the control of weeds; later on, development of synthetic chemical herbicides made it easier to control weeds in a very short time period. However, over time the increased use of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns, weed population shifts, and increased managerial costs have made it difficult for farmers to control these weed species within their limited economic resources. Nowadays, scientists and research organizations are being urged to provide innovative weed management solutions, with minimal ecological impacts. Studies have revealed the importance of cultural strategies for the management of weeds in different cropping systems. Research has proved that alternation of cultural practices, and selection of competitive crop cultivars, could be a possible strategy to minimize the competitiveness of weeds. Increased crop densities, narrower row spacing, intercropping and alternation in row directions are among the weed control strategies gaining rapid attention in many countries. Unfortunately, limited information is available about weed management using crop competition in Pakistan. This review article focusses on the importance of these agronomic practices in reducing the competitive potential of weeds, for their effective and appropriate management in major crops of Pakistan. It is intended to assist researchers in the design of economically viable and eco-friendly weed management strategies, which will aid in eliminating the burden of herbicides and mechanical cultivation from farmer's production costs. [10] In Spain, agriculture triggers soil degradation and erosion processes. New strategies have to be developed to reduce soil losses and recover or maintain soil functionality in order to achieve a sustainable agriculture. An experiment was designed to evaluate the effect of different agricultural management on soil properties and soil erosion. Five different treatments (ploughing, herbicide, control, straw mulch and chipped pruned branches) were established in ""El Teularet experimental station"" located in the Sierra de Enguera (Valencia, Spain). Soil sampling was conducted prior to treatment establishment, and again after 16 months, to determine soil organic matter content (OM), aggregate stability (AS), and microbial biomass carbon content (C<inf>mic</inf>). Fifty rainfall simulations tests (55 mm during one hour, 5-year return period) were applied to measure soil and water losses under each treatment. The highest values of OM, AS and C<inf>mic</inf> were observed in the straw-covered plot, where soil and water losses were negligible. On the contrary, the plot treated with herbicides had the highest soil losses and a slight reduction in C<inf>mic</inf>. Soil erosion control was effective after 16 months on the plots where vegetation was present while on the ploughed and herbicide-treated plots, the practices were not sustainable due to large water and soil losses. Except for the straw mulch plot, soil properties (OM, AS, C<inf>mic</inf>) were not enhanced by the new land managements, but soil erosion control was achieved on three of the five plots used (weeds, weeds plus straw and weeds plus chipped pruned branches). Erosion control strategies such as weeds, weeds plus straw mulch and weeds plus chipped branches mulch are highly efficient in reducing soil losses on traditional herbicide-treated and ploughed agricultural land. However, it takes longer to recover other soil properties such as OM, AS, and C<inf>mic</inf>. [20] Summary: There are many agronomic variables and management strategies other than herbicides that can be manipulated to discourage weed invasion. Combining several management strategies rather than relying on one will increase the likelihood of successful weed management. Encouraging optimal crop canopy health can guide decision-making and render agricultural land less susceptible to weed invasion. Then, when necessary, herbicides can be judiciously used to supplement cultural weed management techniques. In this review we have attempted to address two of the three major habitat characteristics that influence weed invasions - disturbances and, to a lesser extent, high resource ability. The remaining habitat characteristic, low species diversity, is difficult to address in modern agriculture, but can be an avenue of defence against invading species [89]. However, even intercropping, which is an effective ecological weed management technique [90], does not approach species diversity levels in natural ecosystems. A compromise to high species diversity in space is to maximize species diversity in time; this is best accomplished by ensuring that a given field is subjected to diverse rotational crops. Diverse crop rotations are probably the most effective management tool in maintaining crop health and limiting weed invasion opportunities. In the future, very clean (near weed-free) fields may not be considered acceptable [91]. We might do well to alter our view of what is desirable: from an ultra-clean crop with no weeds visible to a more species-rich field with sub-threshold communities of weeds. This approach could be termed ecological weed management [92]. Pest management in disciplines other than weed science may benefit from a few weeds [93, 94]. For example, root maggot (Delia spp) egg deposition and larval damage were reduced in plots where weeds were left in canola longer than the period recommended for optimal yields [95]. Combining and applying the techniques discussed above, reducing herbicide use, and tolerating low infestations of weeds may be the most sustainable form of weed management over the long-term. Ignoring ecological weed management techniques and maintaining current herbicide application practices will ensure a higher frequency of weed invasions of the resistant type [96, 97]. © 2005 Birkhäuser Verlag.",Related but unverifiable

These points represent our joints and special points over the body determining the sizes, distances, angle of flexion, and type of the motion. Knowing this in a specific exercise is the basis of work for rehabilitation and physiotherapy, fitness and self-coaching, augmented reality, animation and gaming, robot management, surveillance and human activity analysis. Implementing such capabilities may use special suits or sensor arrays to achieve the best result, but massive use of PE is related to devices that many users own: namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds. The body pose estimation system starts with capturing the initial data. In dealing with motion detection, it is necessary to analyze a sequence of images rather than a still photo. Different software modules are responsible for tracking 2D key points, creating a body representation, and converting it into a 3D space. Action recognition on the other hand is a way to analyze the sequence of estimated pose data with the aim to categorize sequence under the classes. It is widely used various fields. One of the widely known use cases is analysis and detection of potential attacks of illegal action using video from the surveillance cameras. Another use case involves analysis of the sequence of pose with the aim of creating a virtual coaching environment. Specifically, our research will target this challenging issue and aim to create this environment for mobile devices.

Sniffing is malicious activity performed by network user and because of this network security is at risk so detection of sniffer is essential task to maintain network security.

This multi-sensor approach can help in adjusting grip force and reducing slippage .","[3] Event cameras, i.e., the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) ones, capture the intensity changes in the scene and generates a stream of events in an asynchronous fashion. The output rate of such cameras can reach up to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit from the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5 × 5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images. [5] The Event-Based Sensor (EBS) is a new class of imaging sensor where each pixel independently reports 'events' in response to changes in log intensity, rather than outputting image frames containing the absolute intensity at each pixel. Positive and negative events are emitted from the sensor when the change in log intensity exceeds certain controllable thresholds internal to the device. For objects moving through the field of view, a change in intensity can be related to motion. The sensor records events independently and asynchronously for each pixel with a very high temporal resolution, allowing the detection of objects moving very quickly through the field of view. Recently this type of sensor has been applied to the detection of orbiting space objects using a ground-based telescope. This paper describes a method to treat the data generated by the EBS as a classical detect-then-track problem by collating the events spatially and temporally to form target measurements. An efficient multi-target tracking algorithm, the probabilistic multi-hypothesis tracker (PMHT) is then applied to the EBS measurements to produce tracks. This method is demonstrated by automatically generating tracks on orbiting space objects from data collected by the EBS. [10] Event-based vision, as realized by bio-inspired Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS), is gaining more and more popularity due to its advantages of high temporal resolution, wide dynamic range and power efficiency at the same time. Potential applications include surveillance, robotics, and autonomous navigation under uncontrolled environment conditions. In this paper, we deal with event-based vision for 3D reconstruction of dynamic scene content by using two stationary DVS in a stereo configuration. We focus on a cooperative stereo approach and suggest an improvement over a previously published algorithm that reduces the measured mean error by over 50 percent.

This paper presents a review of the current assessment tools of circular economy projects applied to the construction industry, such as LCA, LCC and CBA. The main objectives of this study were to provide a categorization of CE concepts applied in the construction industry (CI) and to review assessment methods used for evaluating CE projects in CI. This paper selected and reviewed 96 published papers and classified them into one of five aspects of CE highlighted in this study: waste management, reducing the impact on the environment, material & product design, building design, and other. The results showed that the use of assessment methods in CE projects has increased in the recent years as well that an LCA was by far the most used assessment method and waste management the most common aspect of CE in CI.
[3]: In construction, the focus of research and policy on sustainability broadened from reducing the energy consumption of a building in use, to a comprehensive sustainability strategy considering the building's entire life cycle. However, the implementation of life cycle thinking (and its operational counterpart the circular economy) in combination with an objective sustainability evaluation is still in its infancy. Therefore, the aim of this study is twofold. First, it is illustrative for the quantified assessment of the potential environmental and financial benefits and burdens of introducing circular design alternatives for internal wall assemblies to the Belgian market. Second, it reviews the methodological implications on the results of a consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and a life cycle costing (LCC), acknowledging the time dependence and closed-loop nature of those circular design alternatives. That aim is achieved through a multi-model set-up. Evaluating the design alternatives through various methodological assumptions and service life models, allows understanding the relevance and robustness of the results by acknowledging the corresponding uncertainty. In total seven alternative wall assemblies are assessed over a period of 60 years, with a refurbishment every 15 year. The results, without considering the impact of biogenic CO <inf>2</inf> nor the influence of thermal mass, show that a low life cycle impact can be achieved for assemblies that are designed to be used again and have a higher initial impact, such as a plywood boarding connected in a reversible way to demountable metal frame substructure, as well as for assemblies with no possibilities for direct reuse that have a low initial impact, such as a drywall system with a wooden substructure. In addition to the environmental assessment, the life cycle cost of the demountable and reusable wall assemblies with a metal substructure is 10 and 17% lower than that of the conventional alternative with the lowest life cycle cost. Further, regarding the methodological scenarios on marginal supplier identification in the consequential LCA, the range of possible outcomes is however much larger for the demountable wall assemblies than for the conventional ones. For the conventional wall assemblies there is only a small divergence in results of around 10% between the scenarios, while for the demountable ones this deviation rises to 25%. Altogether, this case study points out the potential benefits of introducing demountable and reusable walls, but highlights at the same time the need for a comprehensive sustainability assessment before responsible conclusions can be drawn.",Related but unverifiable

[2]: Anticipation of the life of electric vehicle (EV) batteries is key to the technology's success. Simulation tools combined with data derived from the including driving patterns and climate conditions, are being used to predict the effects of real-world scenarios on batteries. OEMs and Tier One suppliers are using CAE tools to accelerate the testing process, and extrapolate how long a battery can survive in regular driving scenarios. A123 Systems is tackling the problem by feeding into the simulations data from real-world sources. The company has extensive expertise and is starting to have enough real-world experience of different climates and different driving styles. It is observed that the charging pattern of a battery in a hybrid application is different to that of an electric vehicle. Real-world testing is a useful tool and Ford is incorporating data collected from its electric and hybrid vehicle fleet to improve its simulation tools.
[3]: The utilization of high-rate LiFePO<inf>4</inf>-based batteries in hybrid power system environments is described. Two 250 Wh (24V & 10 Ah) large- format battery packs based on A123 Systems ""M1"" cells were designed and implemented in a hydrogen-air fuel cell/battery hybrid power system for a large robotic platform, the ATHELTE rover developed at JPL. Analyses of the performance of these batteries (at both the system and cell levels) under variety of test conditions will be discussed and the advantages of these batteries over other alternatives will be shown. Data from full testing as well as bench top qualification will be discussed. Charge/discharge currents exceeding 100A were tolerated safely and repeatedly. The performance of this pack will be compared to that of other battery chemistries and the promise of this new class of batteries will be discussed.
[4]: The battery consists of one or more electrochemical cell and it transforms stored energy into electricity. Batteries are widely used in flash lights, smart phones and electric cars. Battery Management System (BMS) plays a prominent role in monitoring and controlling of rechargeable batteries. The key terminologies in BMS are as follows, the prime selection of battery chemistry is essential for meticulous applications followed by technologies in battery management systems it includes battery monitoring, diagnostics,control of charging and discharging cycle, state estimate, protection, equalization of charge, heat control and management, early failure detection and assessment to improve overall system performance. An effective BMS protects the battery from damage, forecasts lifetime and maintains battery efficiency. BMS can optimize downtime and battery lifespan per discharge cycle. Finally the outcome of this paper is to identify the best battery chemistry, charging methods, battery model, cell balancing and SOC estimation techniques.
[5]: Battery management system (BMS) is the most important part of an electronic vehicle (EV), and the management module for single cell is the most important collection part of BMS. It provides cells' data and realizes cells management for BMS. In this paper, the design and realization of the management module for single cell is presented. It can collect real-time voltage and temperature data of cells, and carry on the necessary processing for such data, and then upload these data to the main control module in the battery management system. The design can also equalize the cells, and made their voltage remain in a standard. For the proposed design scheme, the microcontroller PIC24F16KA101 is used as the core part, and the multi-cell addressable battery stack monitor LTC6802 is utilized as the collection part. Moreover, the design of multi-channel data collection and management system, and the design of software and hardware for interface are given. The practical experimental results show that the system can realize the real-time multi-channel signal collection, offer useful data for battery management system, and equalize the cells at power on or power off situation, so as to guarantee the battery consistency. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.",Related but unverifiable
i_875,Unverifiable,###  ** Principles of Electropolishing** -  ** Anodic Dissolution** : Electropolishing involves the metal workpiece acting as the anode in an electrolytic cell. Metal ions dissolve from the surface into the electrolyte .,"As a popular application of electrochemical anodic dissolution, electropolishing is extensively adopted in the surface finishing industries of metals. Anodic dissolution is a complex reaction with many process parameters and chemical properties involved. A simple explanation of the mechanism of morphology formation during the EP reaction is still lacking. This study examines the morphology formation of stainless steel 304 at the same location on the specimen as the process evolves. Based on these observations, the basic mechanisms of morphology formation in EP process are proposed. The bubble shielding effect (BSE) and the broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explain the raised and dented morphologies, respectively. The broken bubble tunnelling effect (BBTE) explains the formation mechanism of pitting holes and the bubbleshielding effect (BSE) explains the limitation of surface roughness of electropolishing process. Simulation results are consistent with the observed morphology formation phenomena. © 2012 by ESG.
[5]: Chemical polishing or electropolishing, instead of mechanical polishing, are recommended for the attainment of metallic surface polishes without the introduction of contaminants or tensions in the surface layers of the metal. The fundamental difference between the chemical and electrochemical polishing processes is that in the latter anodic currents/potentials are used to help in the dissolution and passivation of the metal. In this paper, the use of an oxidizing electrolytic solution (2.5 mol L<sup>-1</sup> CrO<inf>3</inf> + 5.0 mol L<sup>-1</sup> H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>) originally employed in electrochemical coloration processes is reported for the electropolishing of AISI-314 stainless steel. Parameters involved in this electropolishing process, such as temperature, current density and time, were optimized so as to attain the best possible results evaluated by the obtained surface brightness measured by reflectance spectra. Surface analyses by scanning electron microscopy allowed a clear correlation between obtained brightness and surface smoothing. The best conditions obtained for the electropolishing process are: temperature of 45°C, electrolysis time of 10 min and current density of around 25 A dm <sup>-2</sup>. It should be pointed out that an electropolishing process signature (periodic oscillations of the cell potential) was established; this may be an important tool for optimizing and monitoring electropolishing processes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Technological advances are allowing higher capacity turbines to be installed and in deeper water, but there is still much that is unknown about the effects on the environment. Here we describe the lessons learned based on the recent literature and our experience with assessing impacts of offshore wind developments on marine mammals and seabirds, and make recommendations for future monitoring and assessment as interest in offshore wind energy grows around the world. The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. As the number and size of offshore wind developments increases, there will be a growing need to consider the population level consequences and cumulative impacts of these activities on marine species. Strategically targeted data collection and modeling aimed at answering questions for the consenting process will also allow regulators to make decisions based on the best available information, and achieve a balance between climate change targets and environmental legislation.

By implementing the model in a GIS environment, the model allows us to calculate the effects of a wind farm using location specific and park design input parameters.

Static assignment of identities is a cornerstone for adversaries in finding targets. Moving Target Defense (MTD) mutates the environment to increase unpredictability for an attacker. On another side, Software Defined Networks (SDN) facilitate a global view of a network through a central control point. The potential of SDN can not only make network management flexible and convenient, but it can also assist MTD to enhance attack surface obfuscation. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for the prevention, detection, and mitigation of flooding-based Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Our framework includes a lightweight SDN assisted MTD strategy for network reconnaissance protection and an efficient approach for tackling DoS attacks using Software Defined-Internet Exchange Point (SD-IXP). To assess the effectiveness of the MTD strategy and DoS mitigation scheme, we set two different experiments. Our results confirm the effectiveness of our framework. With the MTD strategy in place, at maximum, barely 16% reconnaissance attempts were successful while the DoS attacks were accurately detected with false alarm rate as low as 7.1%.

s_549,Unverifiable,"Maintenance Costs: Rebar Reinforced Concrete (RRC): Durability: Traditional steel rebar is prone to corrosion, especially in harsh environments, leading to higher maintenance costs for repairs and rehabilitation .","Corrosion of steel reinforcement in conventional concrete structures induces deterioration of structures. Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite reinforcement can be used in concrete structures instead of steel rebars. This composite rebar prevents the degradation of concrete structures from moisture effects. Moreover, this composite rebar reduces the structural weight and continuous fiber composites are able to arrest cracks and prevent self-similar crack propagation. However, a number of design parameters such as fiber orientation patterns and choices of constituent material combinations provide a multiplicity of design options for this structure, which requires a priori quantification of progressive damage in this composite structure and its fracture characteristics. In this paper, durability and damage tolerance (D&DT) of concrete beams with FRP composite reinforcement under static loading is evaluated using a multi-scale micro-macro progressive failure analysis (PFA) technique that augments commercial FE stress solvers. PFA predicts damage initiation and propagation, fracture initiation and propagation, and the final residual strength in the structure. The prediction is validated with experiment data obtained from full-scale beam tests. In the experiment, each specimen was tested in four-point bending with different specification. Simulation results show in detail the damage progression sequence and structural response characteristics during different degradation stages. Computational simulation provides an alternative evaluation method, giving engineers a detailed description of durability and damage tolerance would take place in the process of ultimate fracture of concrete structures with FRP reinforcement.
[10]: A continued process exists to implement innovative materials to enhance the sustainability and durability of the built infrastructure. Technologies developed over the last two decades have facilitated the use of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites as internal reinforcement bars (rebars) for concrete structures, which have proven to be an alternative to traditional steel reinforcement due to significant advantages, such as magnetic transparency and, most importantly, corrosion resistance, equating to durability and structural life extension. This study evaluated the durability of three different commercially available and most commonly used GFRP rebar types for resistance to aggressive environments, such as those experienced in coastal areas. In total, 216 specimens were exposed to seawater, at various temperatures (23, 40 and 60°C) for different time periods (60 and 120 days). The durability of these GFRP rebars was assessed by testing five different physio-mechanical properties, including: tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, transverse and horizontal shear strength, and bond-strength to concrete. Preliminary results show that the durability of the GFRP rebars after being exposed to seawater at different temperatures, varies considerably among the three different rebar types.

It can be observed that, in spite of their complexity, biological systems are highly reliable and fault tolerant. Hence, we are motivated to take inspiration for biological systems in the design of electronic ones. In SABRE (self-healing cellular architectures for biologically inspired highly reliable electronic systems), we have designed a bio-inspired fault-tolerant hierarchical architecture for this purpose. As in biology, the foundation for the whole system is cellular in nature, with each cell able to detect faults in its operation and trigger intra-cellular or extra-cellular repair as required. At the next level in the hierarchy, arrays of cells are configured and controlled as function units in a transport triggered architecture (TTA), which is able to perform partial-dynamic reconfiguration to rectify problems that cannot be solved at the cellular level. Each TTA is, in turn, part of a larger multi-processor system which employs coarser grain reconfiguration to tolerate faults that cause a processor to fail.

i_1845,Contradiction,"Benefits of Circular Economy: Social: Generates employment opportunities, promotes sustainable practices, and enhances the quality of life by reducing environmental degradation .","Reuse and recirculation of products and materials are the basis of the concept of the circular economy (CE). The CE is an innovative proposal that can result in positive impacts such as reduced demand for raw materials, reduced consumption of basic resources, and job creation, as well as preventing negative impacts resulting from the exploitation and processing of natural resources. Mining is infamous for its potential environmental impact, but mining waste from traditional mining (in the linear economy) may recover material through upcycling techniques, as can urban mining of industrial and post-consumer waste categories (in the circular economy). Urban mining, a form of closed-loop supply chain management, offers an attractive alternative to the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste) and, at the same time, as a sustainable way to exploit mineral resources, reduces primary material intake and stimulates the circularity in the supply chain. The present study reviews the main CE solutions for e-waste management, highlighting the importance of recovering and classifying mineral material according to urban mining procedures.
[15]: The performance economy is a concept which goes beyond most interpretations of a ""circular economy"": the focus is on the maintenance and exploitation of stock (mainly manufactured capital) rather than linear or circular flows of materials or energy. The performance economy represents a full shift to servicisation, with revenue obtained from providing services rather than selling goods. While the form of industrial economy which has dominated the industrialised countries since the industrial revolution is arguably appropriate to overcome scarcities in a developing economy, the performance model is applicable in economies close to saturation, when the quantities of new goods entering use are similar to the quantities of goods being scrapped at the end of life. Key elements of the performance economy are re-use and re-manufacturing, to maintain the quality of stock and extend its service life by reducing material intensity, i.e. the material flow required to create and maintain the stock. Because material flows represent costs which reduce the revenue from service provision, business models inherent in the performance economy support the macro-level objective of extending service life and thereby minimising material intensity. Product life in the performance economy is limited by technological improvements in the efficiency of manufactured capital rather than by damage, wear or fashion. Re-use and re-manufacturing tend to be more labour-intensive and less capital-intensive than virgin material production or primary manufacturing. This enables re-use and remanufacturing to be economically viable at smaller scales. It also enables these activities to substitute labour for energy, reversing the trend which has characterised industrial economies and offering ways to alleviate current environmental, economic and global challenges; i.e. to make the economy more sustainable. However, there are significant barriers to adoption of the performance economy model, partly because economic and business models generally focus on flows (GDP or added value) rather than prioritising the quality, value and use of stock. Promoting the performance model may require a complete re-think of public policy, away from subsiding to taxing use of non-renewable resources and away from taxing the use of renewable resources, of which labour is possibly the most important. Recent analyses of the social costs of unemployment and potential social benefits of a more resource efficient performance economy provide some of the evidence supporting a shift from flow to stock management.",Missing information

Education and Cultural Change: Engineering Education: While transforming engineering education to emphasize sustainability as a core design constraint is important, it is likely that simply integrating sustainability into the curriculum will automatically lead to a systems-oriented perspective among students, without the need for significant cultural change or additional support .","The importance of sustainability to engineering work cannot be denied. Consider, for example, that in the 2011 State of the Union address, President Obama pledged that 80% of the energy used in the United States will come from clean energy sources by 2035.1 Perhaps unprecedented, we face enormous problems like global climate change, poverty, overpopulation, diminishing resources, and pollution, to name a few. The dominant view of engineers' role in this current state of affairs is that of problem solver, or rescuer, such that engineers need only ""design their way out"" of any problems we face as a global society. Rather than a reactionary focus, engineers must be proactive and contemplative and emphasize sustainability as a top design constraint to be considered thoughtfully in terms of people, nature, and future generations. A focus on sustainability must be as heavily weighted as cost, aesthetics, ease of use, etc. But, if we are to get there, we must first change the culture of engineering education. Currently, engineering education treats sustainability as one of many design constraints that likely receives consideration in a classroom module, typically in a capstone design class. One lesson is hardly enough to instill in students the importance of sustainability and sustainable design considerations. While some colleges of engineering have taken on grand educational initiatives to educate students about sustainability and the importance of sustainable design,2-3 we still have an uphill climb to truly transform engineering education to be more focused on sustainable, systems-oriented design, and problem solving. One first step to transforming the culture is to learn how students view sustainability and its relationship to engineering. This is especially important since notions of sustainability and sustainable engineering are wide and varied.4 In this paper, we present Mechanical Engineering students' conceptions of sustainability and how sustainability relates to engineering. Mechanical Engineering, in particular, is a discipline representing great potential in terms of advancing sustainable solutions to our global environmental problems. Yet, the majority of design projects rely on fossil fuels and old technologies that will continue to add CO<inf>2</inf> to the atmosphere.

[7]: Sustainability is increasingly being incorporated into engineering curriculums<sup>1,2</sup>, often due to ABET requirements<sup>3</sup>, but also due to faculty expertise. The United Nations recognizes that achieving sustainable development is only possible if a balance exists between the three dimensions of sustainability: social, economic, and environmental<sup>4</sup>. However, engineering programs can overlook the social dimension by focusing on technological solutions and conflating sustainable development with only environmental protection<sup>5,6</sup>. This paper reports on the evolution of incorporating the social dimensions of sustainability into Engineering for Sustainability, a required sophomore-level course in a Civil and Environmental Engineering Department. The course was created in 2003, revised in 2010<sup>7</sup>, and redesigned in 2015-2016. Throughout the history of the course, sustainability was mostly discussed as the application of the basic sciences to engineering issues focused on protecting the environment. Though social issues were present in some lectures, there was little emphasis on social dimensions until the course's redesign in 2015, when the design of sustainable infrastructure became the focus of the course. Activities that centered on the intersection of social issues, urbanization, and sustainable development were introduced in two class sections during a semester. These discussion-based activities have been revised every semester since their implementation in order to improve student learning outcomes, induce more thoughtful conversations among students, and invoke a deeper evaluation of the complexity of the current urban systems. However, it became evident that it was challenging to address important social issues, because of their complexity, in only two class sessions. Developing students' understanding of social and ethical issues related to sustainable development requires full engagement of the course instructor, considerable preparation time, and the development of curriculum that intentionally brings social dimensions of sustainable technology to the forefront. The 2015 redesign of the course included a format change from lecture-based to a blended style that allowed for more student discussions and active learning opportunities. In 2017, additional curricular revision increased student exposure to social issues from two class sessions deeply focused on social issues per semester to at least 80% of the class sessions (even if briefly). The focused class sessions have evolved from a stakeholder debate approach to exercises that emphasize a socio-technical systems framework, stakeholder value mapping, and empathy building. This paper, using written student work, evaluates how the deepening of discussions revolving around social and ethical issues in sustainable urban development have affected student learning and their ability to integrate social and technical issues when thinking about the design of sustainable infrastructure. We evaluate and analyze student work from three activities that represent the evolution of curriculum in this course over the past three years. Results of the analysis suggest that short interventions in this technical course did increase students' awareness of social impact of technologies and students' understanding of complexity in infrastructure and technological changes.",Related but unverifiable

Objectives To explore factors associated with caregiver involvement in various aspects of older adults' medication management (i.e., ordering, keeping track or ensuring the correct medication is taken at the correct time, and injecting medications). Methods A retrospective analysis of two national surveys, the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study and the National Study of Caregiving was performed.

[7]: This paper compares recycling attitudes and behaviours of key participants in Pakistan's plastics recycling supply chains. It involved mainly cross sectional surveys of 360 households and 51 scrap dealers, and multiple case studies with 26 plastics pre-processors and 28 plastics recyclers (moulders/converters) at seven cities in Pakistan. Guided by the model of consumer recycling behaviour proposed by Thøgersen (International Journal of Research in Marketing, 1994, 11, pp. 145-163) this paper found a mix of different attitudes and behaviours. It appears that households lacked awareness of the process involved after plastics recyclables are collected and they lacked opportunity to participate; furthermore their recycling behaviour was largely motivated by financial benefits. Material recovery facilities provided by the government appeared to be inadequate. For other private-sector participants (scrap dealers, re-processor and moulders), they lacked investment in equipments for sorting and storage of plastics waste.

Recently, deep learning-based person re-identification models have achieved great success in many benchmarks.

In this study, we introduce a method to automatically synthesize labeled person images and adopt them to increase the sample number per identity for person re-identification datasets. To be specific, we use block rectangles to randomly occlude pedestrian images. Then, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model is proposed to use paired occluded and original images to synthesize the de-occluded images that are similar but not identical to the original image. Afterward, we annotate the de-occluded images with the same labels of their corresponding raw images and use them to augment the number of samples per identity. Finally, we use the augmented datasets to train baseline model.

i_238,Contradiction,Types of Attacks: Poisoning Attacks: Involve injecting false information into the network to disrupt the controller's operations .,"Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides significant flexibility when it comes to complex network management. This makes this technology an ideal candidate for dealing with network management issues in satellite and terrestrial networks.One key innovation of SDN is the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This results in a new network element: the controller. Given the importance of the role of the logically centralised (physically distributed) controller, it becomes an important point to protect in the new SDN paradigm. It could be vulnerable to attacks that are common in traditional networks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we address a type of attack that could threaten the operation of SDN-based environments: poisoning attacks.To perform its function, the logically centralised controller must have an accurate view of the network state. The accuracy of this view is crucial to the operation of the network. This view is obtained by exchanging information among controllers and between controllers and network elements. Such information flow could be vulnerable to different types of poisoning attacks. The motivation for writing this paper is that (1) poisoning attacks on SDN networks could have great impact, (2) most of them are relatively recent and (3) the differences between such attacks could be subtle. Therefore, we address the issues by classifying poisoning attacks in SDN. We classify both attacks and defences. For attacks we make a distinction between direct poisoning attacks and attacks that are designed to evade a specific defence.",Missing information

Especially in cities, the use of zero-emission vehicles like electric vehicles is favourable, as emissions of conventional cars cause severe air pollution. Besides CO2, the most important emissions are nitric oxides, particular matter and noise. Given the trend of urbanisation, the problem of air pollution in large cities will rather grow than diminish. Although electric vehicles are an infrastructure-depen­dent technology, one important advantage of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) com­pared to hydrogen-powered vehicles is the possibility to use the existing electricity infrastructure in households for charging. While additional public charging infra­structure is also needed for interim charging or overnight charging for the so-called 'on-street parkers' without own garage, the majority of vehicles could be operated as EVs without additional public charging infrastructure.

Prevention of Acute Complications: Transfusions are effective in treating acute chest syndrome, a severe complication of thalassemia .","Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.
[2]: The therapeutic management of sickle cell disease is based on several strategies, in which red blood cell transfusion plays an essential role in acute complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome and stroke. However, it is important to weigh the benefit/risk before transfusion in children with sickle cell disease and not to rely solely on the value of hemoglobin. Indeed, it is important to remember that a negative antibody screen as well as a negative serological crossmatch test do not totally eliminate alloimmunisation or the risk of post-transfusion haemolysis. Sickle cell patients demonstrate multiple immuno-haematological features: variant phenotypes (especially in the Rh and MNS systems), rare blood groups, allo- and auto-immunisation favored because of the inflammatory state. The presence of an alloimmunisation can lead to a significant delay to obtain compatible red blood cell units, a supply difficulty or even a genuine blood transfusion deadlock. About 30 % of the requests for rare blood in France concerns sickle cell patients. Any vaso-occlusive crisis occurring within 3 to 15 days after a transfusion should be suspected to be a delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reaction; whenever necessary, the child should be referred to a reference center and any further transfusions should be avoided. The so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome, corresponding to a major delayed haemolysis with concomitant destruction of autologous red blood cells, constitutes a major complication of the transfusion and may be potentially fatal. It is essential to educate patients and physicians on the recognition of the clinical signs of delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reactions, in order to rapidly implement measures to limit their immediate effects and avoid their occurrence in case of future transfusion.",Entity error

Data Sources: Eligible trials were identified by a literature search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Control Trials Register, Google Scholar, and EBSCO on the basis of criteria of acceptable quality and relevance. The search was performed using the following terms: yoga for schizophrenia, yoga for depression, yoga for anxiety, yoga for PTSD, yoga therapy, yoga for psychiatric disorders, complementary treatment, and efficacy of yoga therapy. Trials both unpublished and published with no limitation placed on year of publication were included; however, the oldest article included in the final meta-analysis was published in 2000. Study Selection: All available randomized, controlled trials of yoga for the treatment of mental illness were reviewed, and 10 studies were eligible for inclusion. As very few randomized, controlled studies have examined yoga for mental illness, this meta-analysis includes studies with participants who were diagnosed with mental illness, as well as studies with participants who were not diagnosed with mental illness but reported symptoms of mental illness. Trials were excluded due to the following: (1) insufficient information, (2) inadequate statistical analysis, (3) yoga was not the central component of the intervention, (4) subjects were not diagnosed with or did not report experiencing symptoms of one of the psychiatric disorders of interest (ie, schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and PTSD), (5) study was not reported in English, and (6) study did not include a control group. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on participant diagnosis, inclusion criteria, treatment and control groups, duration of intervention, and results (pre-post mean and standard deviations, t values, and f values). Number, age, and sex ratio of participants were also obtained when available. Data Synthesis: The combined analysis of all 10 studies provided a pooled effect size of -3.25 (95% CI, -5.36 to -1.14; P=.002), indicating that yoga-based interventions have a statistically significant effect as an adjunct treatment for major psychiatric disorders. Findings in support of alternative and complementary interventions may especially be an aid in the treatment of disorders for which current treatments are found to be inadequate or to carry severe liabilities. Conclusions: As current psychopharmacologic interventions for severe mental illness are associated with increased risk of weight gain as well as other metabolic side effects that increase patients' risk for cardiovascular disease, yoga may be an effective, far less toxic adjunct treatment option for severe mental illness. © Copyright 2011 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.

Antioxidant defense system deteriorates while enhancing accumulations of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) due to lipid peroxidation and altered enzyme activities in old age. Regular practice of yoga can maintain the antioxidants level of the body, even in stressful conditions. Aim: The present study was designed to assess the effects of lifestyle technique on oxidative stress and lipid profile in normotensive elderly subjects. Materials and Methods: Seventy four healthy elderly subjects (43 males and 31 females) 60 to 80 years of age were selected from the Santosh Medical College, Ghaziabad Uttar Pradesh, India, for three months lifestyle modification program which included morning walk, Nadi shodan pranayama, dietary restrictions and increased intake of water. Blood pressure and oxidative stress markers Glutathione (GSH), Super Oxide Dismutase (SOD) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) were recorded twice, one at baseline and another after three months of lifestyle modifications. Results: Post lifestyle modifications technique values revealed a significant increase in GSH (88.03±9.58 ng/ml vs 93.12±9.17 ng/ml, p < 0.0001) and SOD (78.22±11.97 ng/ml vs 85.22±11.08 ng/ml, p < 0.0001), and a decline in MDA (5.28±0.52 m mol/ml vs 4.48± 0.69 m mol/ml, p < 0.0001) levels. Further, there was significant reduction in the systolic blood pressure (p <0.0001) and diastolic blood pressure (p<0.0002); besides all fasting lipids decreased significantly except High Density Lipids (HDL). Conclusion: The findings of the present study show that lifestyle modification is helpful in reducing cardiovascular disease risk but also assuring for good health by decreasing oxidative stress level along with lipid profile. Further, all these modifications are easy to follow. However, more studies are required to make a generalized lifestyle modification program in normotensive elderly subjects.",Unrelated and unverifiable

[2]: The prevalence of neural tube defects (NTD) in Europe is around 9 per 10,000 births making it one of the most frequent congential anomalies affecting the central nervous system. NTD encompass all anomalies that are secondary to failure of closure of the neural tube. In this review, we will first summarize the embryology and some epidemiologic aspects related to NTDs. The review focuses on myelomeningocele (MMC), which is the most common distal closure defect. We will describe the secondary pathologic changes in the central and peripheral nervous system that appear later on in pregnancy and contribute to the condition's morbidity. The postnatal impact of MMC mainly depends on the upper level of the lesion. In Europe, the vast majority of parents with a fetus with prenatally diagnosed NTDs, including MMC, opt for termination of pregnancy, as they are apparently perceived as very debilitating conditions. Animal experiments have shown that prenatal surgery can reverse this sequence. This paved the way for clinical fetal surgery resulting in an apparent improvement in outcome. The results of a recent randomized trial confirmed better outcomes after fetal repair compared to postnatal repair; with follow up for 30 months. This should prompt fetal medicine specialists to reconsider their position towards this condition as well as its prenatal repair. The fetal surgery centre in Leuven did not have a clinical programme for fetal NTD repair until the publication of the MOMS trial. In order to offer this procedure safely and effectively, we allied to a high volume centre willing to share its expertise and assist us in the first procedures.

[3]: BACKGROUND: There has been some increase in the proportion of Neural Tube Defects (NTD) admitted in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital recently. Fora largely preventable birth defect, this increase is both unnecessary and unacceptable. This study was undertaken to describe the admission patterns and outcome of neural tube defects in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study of babies with neural tube defects who were admitted into Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital from 1st May 2002 to 30th April 2005 was carried out. Their case notes were retrieved and information on the sex, maternal drugs during pregnancy, type of defect and associated malformations, prenatal diagnosis, management and outcome were obtained. The admission rate and the incidence were then calculated. RESULTS: There were 2891 total admissions (1691 males and 1200 females) during the study period of which 37 (1.3%) were neonates with NTD. Of those with NTD, 25 were males and 12 female giving a male to female ratio of 2:1 (statistically not significant p = 0.242.) The total hospital delivery at the study period was 7,388 of which 7 had NTD giving an incidence of 0.95/1000 deliveries. The commonest type of NTD was myelomeningocoele in 31 (83.8%), and the commonest site was the thoracolumbar region (93.5%). Frontal encephalocoele was seen in 6 (16.2%). All the babies with myelomeningocoele presented with flaccid paraparesis and were incontinent of both urine and faeces. Seventeen of the babies had only spina bifida while 14 had additional defects including talipes equinovarus (8), hydrocephalus (2), frontal encephalocoele (1), and multiple malformations (3). Ten babies (27%) died, three of them after surgery. All the mothers received folic acid from the second trimester of pregnancy, but none did before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The Incidence of NTD is on the increase in our environment. There is need to formulate/implement the policy of preconceptional folic acid therapy for all woman of childbearing age as a preventive measure
[4]: Incidence: Worldwide, the incidence of neural tube defects (NTDs) varies from 0.17 to 6.39 per 1,000 live births. The declining prevalence of myelomeningocele, the most common NTD, is secondary to several factors including folic acid fortification, prenatal diagnosis with termination of affected fetuses, and unknown factors. Impact of changes: Of those born with myelomeningocele, survival during infancy and preschool years has improved over the last 25 years (Bowman et al., Pediatr Neurosurg 34:114-120, 4). Fewer newborns today require shunt placement, which will hopefully improve the long-term mortality associated with this disease (Chakraborty et al., J Neurosurg Pediatr 1(5):361-365, 13, unpublished data). Of a cohort born in 1975-1979 and treated at a single US institution, 74% have survived into young adulthood.

Variations in these structural parameters alone can lead to drastic changes in the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) .","Bidirectional reflectance signatures of vegetation are strongly shaped by the shadows cast between objects in a scene, such as tree crowns or leaves. Differences in the shape and spatial density of these objects result in distinct bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs) in different biomes. We examined how allometry may constrain the variability of canopy architectural parameters in BRDF models, and consequently alter the attribution of variation in the simulated bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF). Allometry is the covariation between the size or number of organisms and their component parts. To test the importance of realistic variation and covariation of canopy architecture on BRDF, we incorporated the 3-D radiative transfer model DISORD (which uses the geometric optics (GO) model of Li and Strahler) into a Monte Carlo (MC) algorithm. The MC algorithm generated an ensemble of tree canopies whose parameters fulfilled the allometry of a set of measured forest plots from Russian forest inventory. The role of view geometry was directly considered using perturbations of the parameters to evaluate the sensitivity of the BRF itself, evaluated at different view angles, and the difference in BRF (ΔBRF) as measured at two view angles representing paired satellite observations. The allometrically constrained forest plots had reduced variation in ΔBRF compared to the uncorrelated plots, but the variation of the BRF itself is dramatically increased by allometry. The variation of the BRF is relatively constant among the view angles examined, whereas the variation in ΔBRF increases dramatically with larger phase angles. The BRF was most sensitive to canopy attributes that were important in radiative transfer, such as LAI and stem area index (SAI), but there were also large (∼ 40% of variance) contributions of geometric components such as tree number, crown size, and ground cover. By contrast, sensitivity of ΔBRF was dominated by ground cover, crown size and tree number, which all play a role in the GO calculations. The mix of sensitive parameters was not dramatically different between gymnosperms and angiosperms, nor between allometric and correlated runs. Together these results indicate that forest structure and leaf area could be usefully inverted together using paired observations with different viewing geometries. Ideal pairs of observations are those with large difference in phase angle, and along the gradient of the BRF peak, which most commonly occur with sequential MODIS/Terra overpasses. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

[7]: The concept of canopy spectral invariants expresses the observation that simple algebraic combinations of leaf and canopy spectral reflectance become wavelength independent and determine two canopy structure specific variables - the recollision and escape probabilities. These variables specify an accurate relationship between the spectral response of a vegetation canopy to incident solar radiation at the leaf and the canopy scale. They are sensitive to important structural features of the canopy such as forest cover, tree density, leaf area index, crown geometry, forest type and stand age.

[8]: The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels.

The four key lessons learned that we discuss are: 1) Identifying the area over which biological effects may occur to inform baseline data collection and determining the connectivity between key populations and proposed wind energy sites, 2) The need to put impacts into a population level context to determine whether they are biologically significant, 3) Measuring responses to wind farm construction and operation to determine disturbance effects and avoidance responses, and 4) Learn from other industries to inform risk assessments and the effectiveness of mitigation measures. As the number and size of offshore wind developments increases, there will be a growing need to consider the population level consequences and cumulative impacts of these activities on marine species. Strategically targeted data collection and modeling aimed at answering questions for the consenting process will also allow regulators to make decisions based on the best available information, and achieve a balance between climate change targets and environmental legislation.",Opposite meaning

s_669,Unverifiable,Summary of Key Points: Cost Optimization: Statistical methodologies and efficient modeling tools are essential for optimizing power delivery components and reducing costs .,"Modern computer servers require cutting edge technologies to meet their expected high performance. Among several relevant disciplines, power delivery (PD) is a key player in this regard. Efficient and reliable statistical methods to reduce cost while keeping adequate server's performance are highly demanded from the PD perspective. This paper addresses a feasible statistical methodology based on design of experiments (DoE) for evaluating platform's power delivery ingredients. Our methodology explores voltage regulator's intrinsic parameters, compensation networks, non-linear compensation parameters, and the amount of bulk capacitors. Our statistical approach aims at identifying those variables with the largest impact on computer server's PD performance, as well as optimizing them at the system level while achieving cost reduction.
[7]: Power systems modeling tools used to analyze static and dynamic characteristics usually rely on detailed and complex models, thus taking a long simulation time. Due to the acceleration of time to market of today's computing platforms, it is required to arrive at feasible solution options in a short amount of time to meet cost and time targets. Specifically, the areas of power conversion and power management traditionally rely on experimental verification and are lacking in computer design methodologies. In this paper, a modeling methodology based on fundamental building block models for power delivery systems is presented to address the aspects of energy efficiency optimization, area occupied by the power delivery solution and the cost associated with power conversion. © 2009 IEEE.",Related but unverifiable

The goal of this pilot registry study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a uniquely designed ointment containing multivalent silver oxide (Ag4O4) in the healing of difficult diabetic or venous ulcerations. Patients who had ulcers resulting from chronic venous insufficiency or diabetes participated in this open-label, randomized registry study. All patients were evaluated by measuring both the area of the ulceration and microcirculatory parameters. 148 patients were included in the study and categorized into two main groups: venous ulcers and diabetic ulcers. Each main group was then randomized into two sub-groups: topical treatment with silver oxide ointment and the control group (standard cleaning and compression management methods, without silver ointment). All patients were treated with accepted cleaning and compression management. RESULTS. In subjects with venous ulcers: After 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 was increased 2.1 times more than the control group (17.4% to 8.2%) and skin flux (RF) was improved 1.6 times more than the control group (-38.7% to -24.2%). The total surface area of the ulcer was significantly reduced in the silver treatment group by 1.9 times the control group (-88.7% to -46.9%). In addition, in the silver treatment group we observed complete closure of the ulceration in 42% of subjects compared to 22% in the control group (P=<0.05). In subjects with diabetic ulcers: after 4 weeks, the silver treatment was more effective than the control group treatment: Skin PO2 increased 2.6 times more than the control group (23.3% to 9.1%) and skin flux (RF) was significantly improved 4.3 times more than the control group(-26.7% to -6.2%). The total surface area of the ulcer was significantly reduced in the silver treatment group by 3.7 times the control group (-89.0% to -23.9%). In addition, in the silver treatment group we observed complete closure of the ulceration in 39% of subjects compared to 16% in the control group (P</=0.05). This pilot study provides observational data on the efficacy of local treatment of ulcers with a multivalent silver oxide containing ointment. The silver ointment improved microcirculation and the healing rate of all 78 patients that were treated with multivalent silver ointment and closed twice as many ulcers in 4 weeks compared to the control groups (40.7% silver treatment compared to 19.4% for the control). This study demonstrates the feasibility of this type of treatment and provides evidence of efficacy to plan larger randomized controlled studies.

Behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as wildcats adapted to urban environments, leading to the domesticated cats we know today .","[6] It is clear from his published works that Charles Darwin considered domestication to be very useful in exploring and explaining mechanisms of evolutionary change. Not only did domestication occupy the introductory chapter of On the Origin of Species, but he revisited the topic in a two-volume treatise less than a decade later. In addition to drawing much of his information about heredity from studies of domesticated animals and plants, Darwin saw important parallels between the process of artificial selection by humans and natural selection by the environment. There was resistance to this analogy even among Darwin's contemporary supporters when it was proposed, and there also has been disagreement among historians and philosophers regarding the role that the analogy with artificial selection actually played in the discovery of natural selection. Regardless of these issues, the analogy between artificial and natural selection remains important in both research and education in evolution. In particular, the present article reviews ten lessons about evolution that can be drawn from the modern understanding of domestication and artificial selection. In the process, a basic overview is provided of current approaches and knowledge in this rapidly advancing field.

This period has seen rapid change in attitudes and practices towards companion animals, with notable advances in medical treatment, nutrition, and understanding of non-human animal behavior, as well as re-evaluations of the position of animals within the home. Based upon in-depth interviews with companion animal caretakers and professionals involved in the companion animal industry, we examined these changes in the United Kingdom. Major themes were identified: Humanization, Commercialization, Medicalization, Responsible Companionship, and Alternative Companionship. These changes have had largely positive effects on companion animal health and welfare, but also bring new expectations of the companion relationship, which humans and nonhuman animals may be unable or unwilling to fulfill. While dominant discourses of responsible companionship prevail, the process of change is ongoing and reflects emerging trends in human society towards diversification and alternative lifestyles.",Related but unverifiable

Results show that plasma triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterols became lesser, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol became higher in LA-supplemented groups compared to the control. In addition, a significant reduction occurred in the liver and egg yolk cholesterol by LA supplementation. Moreover, the immunological parameters including antibody titer against sheep red blood cells (SRBCs), phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-wattle swelling test, and T-& B-lymphocyte proliferation were enhanced in laying hens supplemented with LA compared to the control hens. While the heterophil to lymphocyte (H/L) ratio decreased with LA supplementation, indicating low stress conditions in the treated hens. These positive effects for LA were further reflected on the productive performance of laying hens and improved egg production, egg weight, egg mass, and feed efficiency. Our findings indicate that LA probiotic could be recommended in laying hens' diets for lowering egg yolk cholesterol with positive impacts on health and performance.

In total, 180 one-day-old male Cobb 500 broilers were randomly allocated into three groups comprising a non-infected control (NC) group, basal diet + necrotic enteritis challenge (NE) group, and basal diet + 4 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g Lactobacillus plantarum HW1 + necrotic enteritis challenge (HW1) group. Broilers in the NE and HW1 groups were orally given sporulated coccidian oocysts at day 14 and Clostridium perfringens from days 19 to 21. The results showed that the HW1 treatment increased (p < 0.05) the average daily gain of broilers from days 15 to 28 and from days 0 to 28 compared with the NE group. Moreover, the HW1 treatment decreased (p < 0.05) the oocysts per gram of excreta, intestinal lesion scores, ileal interleukin (IL) 1β and tumor necrosis factor α levels, and serum D-lactic acid and diamine oxidase levels, while increasing (p < 0.05) the ileal IL-10 level, thymus index, and protein expressions of ileal occludin and ZO-1.

In a mesocosm experiment, a 2°C increase in water temperature led to a ninefold increase in pCO₂, which suggests that all shallow ponds will experience similar increases in carbon release regardless of their specific conditions .","There is an urgent need to understand the effect of climate warming on the carbon dynamics of lakes and ponds in order to assess contributions to global carbon budgets. Currently, we are unable to predict how the exchange of carbon gases (i.e. CO<inf>2</inf>) across the air-water boundary and organic carbon storage in the sediments will be altered with realistic warming scenarios downscaled from climatic models. Given the prevalence of shallow systems and tight atmospheric coupling, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the impacts of warming on CO<inf>2</inf> saturation in a shallow prairie pond. We outline and test three possible scenarios for the effect of warming on the CO<inf>2</inf> saturation of ponds, resulting in either an increase, decrease or no net effect for CO<inf>2</inf> saturation.

The effects of such exposure are poorly understood. RESULTS: Starch granule size was increased by 5 days' short-term heat stress (35.0 °C) and the increase was higher when the stress was introduced early. Heat stress increased the iodine binding capacity of starches and no difference was observed among the three stages. Starch relative crystallinity was increased and swelling power was decreased only when heat stress was introduced early. Heat stress also increased the pasting viscosity, and this effect became more pronounced with later applications of stress. Heat stress reduced starch gelatinization enthalpy, and the reduction gradually increased with later exposures. Heat stress increased the gelatinization temperature and retrogradation enthalpy and percentage of the samples, with the increases being largest with earlier introduction of high temperature. CONCLUSION: Heat stress increased the pasting viscosities and retrogradation percentage of starch by causing change in granule size, amylopectin chain length distribution and crystallinity, and the effects observed were more severe with earlier introduction of heat stress after pollination. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry.",Misrepresentation

However, the risks associated with transfusions, such as iron overload and alloimmunization, require careful management and ongoing research to optimize treatment protocols .","Blood transfusion remains an important therapeutic intervention in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), aiming to both increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood and to reduce the complications of vaso-occlusion. Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers.
[2]: The therapeutic management of sickle cell disease is based on several strategies, in which red blood cell transfusion plays an essential role in acute complications such as vaso-occlusive crisis, acute chest syndrome and stroke. However, it is important to weigh the benefit/risk before transfusion in children with sickle cell disease and not to rely solely on the value of hemoglobin. Indeed, it is important to remember that a negative antibody screen as well as a negative serological crossmatch test do not totally eliminate alloimmunisation or the risk of post-transfusion haemolysis. Sickle cell patients demonstrate multiple immuno-haematological features: variant phenotypes (especially in the Rh and MNS systems), rare blood groups, allo- and auto-immunisation favored because of the inflammatory state. The presence of an alloimmunisation can lead to a significant delay to obtain compatible red blood cell units, a supply difficulty or even a genuine blood transfusion deadlock. About 30 % of the requests for rare blood in France concerns sickle cell patients. Any vaso-occlusive crisis occurring within 3 to 15 days after a transfusion should be suspected to be a delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reaction; whenever necessary, the child should be referred to a reference center and any further transfusions should be avoided. The so-called hyperhaemolysis syndrome, corresponding to a major delayed haemolysis with concomitant destruction of autologous red blood cells, constitutes a major complication of the transfusion and may be potentially fatal. It is essential to educate patients and physicians on the recognition of the clinical signs of delayed haemolytic post-transfusion reactions, in order to rapidly implement measures to limit their immediate effects and avoid their occurrence in case of future transfusion.
[3]: Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters.
[9]: Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.",Related but unverifiable

Active contour is one of the most widely used techniques for ultrasound image segmentation. This method has drawbacks such as the predefined initial curve position and the number of contour points to be considered. A new active contour segmentation for extracting the intima media layer and plaque in the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) ultrasound images is presented in this paper. This paper has proposed a fuzzy weighted graph based active contour segmentation technique to overcome all these drawbacks. The proposed method is used for segmenting Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) and plaque in common carotid artery B-mode ultrasound images to assess the risk of stroke in the human subject under investigation. Using canny edge detection and connected component analysis methods, the initial contour was determined and applied as input to the proposed active contour segmentation algorithm. The proposed algorithm was compared with five conventional methods. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has produced better results than traditional methods. The overall probability of error achieved by the proposed algorithm was 5.28%, which was very less compared to other conventional methods.
[5]: This paper presents a new deformable model based on level sets for medical image segmentation which plays a pivotal role in medical diagnosis. The current popular Image segmentation deformable models such as Snakes, Geometric Active Contours, Gradient Vector Flow, Level sets and Variational Level sets have a limitation that the convergence of the contour towards the object boundary is slow and hence not suitable for real time medical diagnosis. To counter this limitation we present an improved image segmentation algorithm which is computationally efficient and also the proximity of the contour towards the object is higher compared to existing algorithms. A new speed term is introduced in the evolution step of variational level set in order to speed up the convergence process. The variational level sets in images with intensity inhomogeneity, tend to be slower and prone to leakage of contour outside the object boundary. This is due to the selection of gradient information for the termination of convergence process. However, this limitation is overcome in the proposed algorithm by modifying the edge indicator function embedded with the speed term that optimizes the effective distance of the attractive force. Experimental results are provided using real time medical images. Comparative tables and graphs highlighting the performance of various deformable models are also presented.",Misrepresentation

While the roles of bottom-up processes are better appreciated they are still viewed as principally affecting the outcome of top-down processes. Sponges on coral reefs are important members of the benthic community and provide a critically important functional linkage between water-column productivity and the benthos. As active suspension feeders sponges utilize the abundant autotrophic and heterotrophic picoplankton in the water column. As a result sponges across the Caribbean basin exhibit a consistent and significant pattern of greater biomass, tube extension rate, and species numbers with increasing depth. Likewise, the abundance of their food supply also increases along a depth gradient. Using experimental manipulations it has recently been reported that predation is the primary determinant of sponge community structure. Here we provide data showing that the size and growth of the sponge Callyspongia vaginalis are significantly affected by food availability. Sponges increased in size and tube extension rate with increasing depth down to 46 m, while simultaneously exposed to the full range of potential spongivores at all depths. Additionally, we point out important flaws in the experimental design used to demonstrate the role of predation and suggest that a resolution of this important question will require well-controlled, multi-factorial experiments to examine the independent and interactive effects of predation and food abundance on the ecology of sponges. © 2013 Lesser, Slattery.
[3]: Sponges, porous filter-feeding organisms consisting of vast canal systems, provide unique substrates for diverse symbiotic organisms. The Spongia (Spongia) sp. massive sponge is obligately inhabited by the host-specific endosymbiotic bivalve Vulsella vulsella, which benefits from this symbiosis by receiving protection from predators. However, whether the host sponge gains any benefit from this association is unclear. Considering that the bivalves exhale filtered water into the sponge body rather than the ambient environment, the sponge is hypothesized to utilize water exhaled by the bivalves to circulate water around its body more efficiently. We tested this hypothesis by observing the sponge aquiferous structure and comparing the pumping rates of sponges and bivalves. Observations of water currents and the sponge aquiferous structure revealed that the sponge had a unique canal system enabling it to inhale water exhaled from bivalves, indicating that the host sponge adapted morphologically to receive water from the bivalves. In addition, the volume of water circulating in the sponge body was dramatically increased by the water exhaled from bivalves. Therefore, this spongebivalve association can be regarded as a novel mutualism in which two filter-feeding symbionts promote mutual filtering rates. This symbiotic association should be called a ""filtering mutualism"".",Related but unverifiable

As no regulation is currently in place, innovative solutions are needed to mitigate the impact that Low Earth Orbit objects can have during uncontrolled re-entry and the associated potential events of surface collision. We investigated the requirements, in terms of materials selection, for the development of a 3D-printed structural bus able to withstand loads during launch and in-orbit operations, with the objectives to be as light as possible and requiring the least amount of heat for demise during atmospheric re-entry. The selection indicated magnesium alloys as the best candidates to improve the reference material, aluminium 6061 T6, resulting in both mass-reduction and improved demisability. We also analysed how the relative importance of these two objectives can modify the selection of materials: if minimizing the heat to disintegration were valued more highly than lightness, for example, the new best candidates would become tin alloys. Our analysis, furthermore, suggested the importance of Liquid Crystal Polymer as the sole plastic material approaching the performance of the best metal choices. This contribution, thus, provides novel insight in the field of 3D-printed materials for the fast-growing CubeSat segment, complying with the debris mitigation initiatives promoted by space agencies and institutions.",Opposite meaning

Satellite and Remote Sensing: Optical Remote Sensing: Satellite-acquired optical remote sensing data can rapidly survey road conditions over large areas, identifying segments that require repair or inspection .","Analysis of satellite-acquired synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides a way to rapidly survey road conditions over large areas. This capability could be useful for identifying road segments that potentially require repair or at least onsite inspection of their condition due to changes in vehicular traffic associated with change in land use. We conducted a feasibility study focused on urban roads near the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) campus in San Antonio, Texas. The roads near SwRI were affected by heavy truck traffic, they were easily inspected, and the age and construction of the pavement was known. TerraSAR-X (TSX) SpotLight (ST) satellite data were used to correlate radar backscattering response to pavement age and condition. Our preliminary results indicate that TSX radar imagery can be useful for detecting changes in pavement type, damage to pavement, such as cracking and scaling, and, occasionally, severe rutting. In addition, multitemporal interferometric analysis showed patches of settlement along two roads south of the SwRI campus. Further development of an automated approach to detect degradation of roads could allow transportation departments to prioritize inspection and repair efforts. The techniques also could be used to detect surreptitious heavy truck traffic in areas where direct inspection is not possible.",Entity error

The experiments were performed at two tunnels: Jânio Quadros (TJQ), where 99 % of the vehicles are LDVs, and RodoAnel Mário Covas (TRA), where up to 30 % of the fleet are HDVs. Fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2.5</inf>) samples were collected on quartz filters in May and July 2011 at TJQ and TRA, respectively. The samples were analyzed by thermal-desorption proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (TD-PTR-MS) and by thermal-optical transmittance (TOT). Emission factors (EFs) for organic aerosol (OA) and organic carbon (OC) were calculated for the HDV and the LDV fleet. We found that HDVs emitted more PM<inf>2.5</inf> than LDVs, with OC EFs of 108 and 523 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> burned fuel for LDVs and HDVs, respectively. More than 700 ions were identified by TD-PTR-MS and the EF profiles obtained from HDVs and LDVs exhibited distinct features. Unique organic tracers for gasoline, biodiesel, and tire wear have been tentatively identified. nitrogen-containing compounds contributed around 20 % to the EF values for both types of vehicles, possibly associated with incomplete fuel burning or fast secondary production. Additionally, 70 and 65 % of the emitted mass (i.e. the OA) originates from oxygenated compounds from LDVs and HDVs, respectively. This may be a consequence of the high oxygen content of the fuel. On the other hand, additional oxygenation may occur during fuel combustion. The high fractions of nitrogen- and oxygen-containing compounds show that chemical processing close to the engine/tailpipe region is an important factor influencing primary OA emission. The thermal-desorption analysis showed that HDVs emitted compounds with higher volatility, and with mainly oxygenated and longer chain hydrocarbons than LDVs.",Numeric error

For instance, the resistance to Fusarium graminearum is solely dependent on the accumulation of specific metabolites and the expression of defense-related genes, which are not influenced by environmental conditions or genetic factors .","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat and barley. Resistance to FHB is highly complex and quantitative in nature, and is most often classified as resistance to spikelet infection and resistance to spread of pathogen through the rachis. In the present study, a resistant (CI9831) and a susceptible (H106-371) two-row barley genotypes, with contrasting levels of spikelet resistance to FHB, pathogen or mock-inoculated, were profiled for metabolites based on liquid chromatography and high resolution mass spectrometry. The key resistance-related (RR) metabolites belonging to fatty acids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and terpenoid biosynthetic pathways were identified. The free fatty acids (FFAs) linoleic and palmitic acids were among the highest fold change RR induced (RRI) metabolites. These FFAs are deposited as cutin monomers and oligomers to reinforce the cuticle, which acts as a barrier to pathogen entry. Quantitative real-time PCR studies revealed higher expressions of KAS2, CYP86A2, CYP89A2, LACS2 and WAX INDUCER1 (HvWIN1) transcription factor in the pathogen-inoculated resistant genotype than in the susceptible genotype. Knockdown of HvWIN1 by virus-induced genes silencing (VIGS) in resistant genotype upon pathogen inoculation increased the disease severity and fungal biomass, and decreased the abundance of FFAs like linoleic and palmitic acids. Notably, the expression of CYP86A2, CYP89A2 and LAC2 genes was also suppressed, proving the link of HvWIN1 in regulating these genes in cuticle biosynthesis as a defense response.
[6]: Head blight of wheat in the United States is caused primarily by the deoxynivalenol (DON)-producing chemotype of Fusarium graminearum. However, the discovery of the nivalenol (NIV) chemotype of F. graminearum in Louisiana and Arkansas necessitates having resistance in wheat to both chemotypes. The objectives of this research were to quantify resistance of selected winter wheat lines to initial infection and pathogen spread within spikes, to determine whether wheat lines selected for resistance to the DON chemotype also have resistance to the NIV chemotype, and to improve the methods for quantifying resistance to initial infection. A susceptible check (Coker 9835) and 15 winter wheat lines, which are adapted to the southeastern United States and possess diverse sources of head blight resistance, were evaluated for head blight resistance in a series of greenhouse and growthchamber experiments. Significant levels of resistance to both initial infection and spread within a spike were found among the lines, and lines with resistance to isolates of the DON chemotype had even higher levels of resistance to isolates of the NIV chemotype. Quantifying resistance to initial infection was improved by standardizing the inoculum and environmental conditions. Additional information related to resistance to spread within a spike was obtained by calculating the area under the disease progress curve from 7 to 21 days after inoculation. © 2011 The American Phytopathological Society.",Opposite meaning

Technological and Agricultural Innovations: Improved Crop Varieties: Developing and adopting high-performing crop varieties that are resistant to biotic and abiotic stresses can significantly enhance productivity, suggesting that molecular plant breeding alone is sufficient to improve yield potential and stability without considering other management practices .","The balance between the supply and demand of the major food crops is fragile, fueling concerns for long-term global food security. The rising population, increasing wealth and a proliferation of non-food uses (e.g. bioenergy) has led to growing demands on agriculture, while increased production is limited by greater urbanization, and the degradation of land. Furthermore, global climate change with increasing temperatures and lower, more erratic rainfall is projected to decrease agricultural yields. There is a predicted need to increase food production by at least 70% by 2050 and therefore an urgent need to develop novel and integrated approaches, incorporating high-throughput phenotyping that will both increase production per unit area and simultaneously improve the resource use efficiency of crops. Yield potential, yield stability, nutrient and water use are all complex multigenic traits and while there is genetic variability, their complexity makes such traits difficult to breed for directly. Nevertheless molecular plant breeding has the potential to deliver substantial improvements, once the component traits and the genes underlying these traits have been identified. In addition, interactions between the individual traits must also be taken into account, a demand that is difficult to fulfill with traditional screening approaches. Identified traits will be incorporated into new cultivars using conventional or biotechnological tools. In order to better understand the relationship between genotype, component traits, and environment over time, a multidisciplinary approach must be adopted to both understand the underlying processes and identify candidate genes, QTLs and traits that can be used to develop improved crops. © 2012 Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
[3]: Intensification in rice crop production is generally understood as requiring increased use of material inputs: water, inorganic fertilizers, and agrochemicals. However, this is not the only kind of intensification available. More productive crop phenotypes, with traits such as more resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and shorter crop cycles, are possible through modifications in the management of rice plants, soil, water, and nutrients, reducing rather than increasing material inputs. Greater factor productivity can be achieved through the application of new knowledge and more skill, and (initially) more labor, as seen from the System of Rice Intensification (SRI), whose practices are used in various combinations by as many as 10 million farmers on about 4 million hectares in over 50 countries. The highest yields achieved with these management methods have come from hybrids and improved rice varieties, confirming the importance of making genetic improvements. However, unimproved varieties are also responsive to these changes, which induce better growth and functioning of rice root systems and more abundance, diversity, and activity of beneficial soil organisms. Some of these organisms as symbiotic endophytes can affect and enhance the expression of rice plants' genetic potential as well as their phenotypic resilience to multiple stresses, including those of climate change. SRI experience and data suggest that decades of plant breeding have been selecting for the best crop genetic endowments under suboptimal growing conditions, with crowding of plants that impedes their photosynthesis and growth, flooding of rice paddies that causes roots to degenerate and forgoes benefits derived from aerobic soil organisms, and overuse of agrochemicals that adversely affect these organisms as well as soil and human health. This review paper reports evidence from research in India and Indonesia that changes in crop and water management can improve the expression of rice plants' genetic potential, thereby creating more productive and robust phenotypes from given rice genotypes. Data indicate that increased plant density does not necessarily enhance crop yield potential, as classical breeding methods suggest. Developing cultivars that can achieve their higher productivity under a wide range of plant densities—breeding for density-neutral cultivars using alternative selection strategies—will enable more effective exploitation of available crop growth resources. Density-neutral cultivars that achieve high productivity under ample environmental growth resources can also achieve optimal productivity under limited resources, where lower densities can avert crop failure due to overcrowding. This will become more important to the extent that climatic and other factors become more adverse to crop production. Focusing more on which management practices can evoke the most productive and robust phenotypes from given genotypes is important for rice breeding and improvement programs since it is phenotypes that feed our human populations.",Misrepresentation

Due to a lack of effective screening methods, most cases are diagnosed at later stages where the survival rates are poor. Thus, it is termed a 'silent killer' and is the most lethal of all the malignancies in women. IQ motif containing GTPase Activating Protein 3 (IQGAP3) is a member of the Rho family of GTPases, and plays a crucial role in the development and progression of several types of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the oncogenic functions and mechanisms of IQGAP3 on the proliferation and metastasis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC). Therefore, the expression levels of IQGAP3 in HGSOC and normal tissue samples were compared, and IQGAP3 knockdown was performed to examine its functional role using various in vitro and in vivo experiments. It was demonstrated that the expression of IQGAP3 was upregulated in HGSOC tissues compared with the healthy tissues; this differential expression was also observed in the ovarian cancer cell lines. Functional experimental results suggested that IQGAP3 silencing significantly reduced proliferation, migration and invasion in ovarian cancer cell lines. Moreover, in vivo experimental findings validated the in vitro results, where the tumorigenic and metastatic capacities of IQGAP3-silenced cells were significantly lower in the nude mice compared with the mice implanted with the control cells. Furthermore, knockdown of IQGAP3 resulted in increased apoptosis, and the effects of IQGAP3 expression on various epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers were identified, suggesting a possible mechanism associated with the role of IQGAP3 in metastasis. The effect of IQGAP3 silencing on chemosensitivity towards olaparib was also assessed.

Our goal was to evaluate the causes of within- and between-stand variation in the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), an indicator of xanthophyll cycle activity and carotenoid pigment content that often scales with photosynthetic light-use efficiency. Both the dark-state PRI values and the change in PRI upon dark-light transition (ΔPRI) were measured in situ in leaves from different canopy positions (top vs. bottom) having contrasting light histories (sun vs. shade). PRI varied with species, canopy position, and with the pool sizes of several photoprotective carotenoid pigments (relative to chlorophyll). Upper-canopy leaves had a greater Δ PRI than their shaded counterparts lower in the canopy, reflecting a higher investment of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle pigments for sun-exposed top-canopy leaves. These results indicate that the relative concentration of different pigment groups and associated PRI responses varied with canopy position and light history over more than one time scale, and included rapidly changing (facultative) and slowly changing (constitutive) components. Most of the PRI variability among the forest trees sampled was due to constitutive pigment pool size variation associated with species and canopy position. We conclude that both facultative and constitutive pigment components should be considered when applying PRI to photosynthetic studies of forest stands with remote sensing. Leaf-level measurements of PRI and ΔPRI provide non-destructive probes of both facultative and constitutive pigment changes within plant canopies that could help interpret variation in PRI signal viewed from remote sensing platforms. © 2012 Science From Israel / LPPltd., Jerusalem.
[2]: The spectral properties of plant leaves reflect the state of their photosynthetic apparatus and the surrounding environment. A well-known mechanism of photosynthetic downregulation, active on the time scale from minutes to hours, is caused by reversible changes in the xanthophyll cycle pigments. These changes affect leaf spectral absorption and are frequently quantified using the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI). This index can thus be used to monitor the photosynthetic status of the vegetation canopy, potentially from a large distance, and allows for a global satellite-based monitoring of photosynthesis. Such Earth observation satellites in near-polar orbits usually cover the same geographical location at the same local solar time at regular intervals. To facilitate the interpretation of these instantaneous remote PRI measurements and scale them to longer timescales, we measured the daily course of leaf PRI in two evergreen biomes: European boreal forest and Amazon rainforest. The daily course of PRI was different for the two locations. In Amazon, PRI was driven by incident Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD). In the boreal location, PRI and PPFD were decoupled and PRI indicated downregulation only in the afternoon. This downregulation was confirmed with carbon exchange measurements. The study demonstrates the utility of biome-specific daily PRI curves for scaling instantaneous remote measurements to daily values and comparing data acquired at different times of day.",Misrepresentation
s_1531,Contradiction,"This symbiosis is not important in soils with low phosphate levels, where direct absorption by plant roots is sufficient .","This review highlights the key role that mycorrhizal fungi play in making phosphorus (Pi) more available to plants, including pathways of phosphorus absorption, phosphate transporters and plant-mycorrhizal fungus sym-biosis, especially in conditions where the level of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in the soil is low. Mycorrhizal fungi colonization involves a series of signaling where the plant root exudates strigolactones, while the mycorrhizal fungi release a mixture of chito-oligosaccharides and liposaccharides, that activate the symbiosis process through gene signaling pathways, and contact between the hyphae and the root. Once the symbiosis is established, the extraradical mycelium acts as an extension of the roots and increases the absorption of nutrients, particularly phosphorus by the phosphate transporters. Pi then moves along the hyphae to the plant root/fungus interface. The transfer of Pi occurs in the apoplectic space; in the case of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Pi is discharged from the arbuscular to the plant's root symplasm, in the membrane that surrounds the arbuscule. Pi is then absorbed through the plant periarbuscular membrane by plant phosphate transporters. Furthermore, plants can acquire Pi from soil as a direct absorption pathway. As a result of this review, several genes that codify for high-affinity Pi transporters were identified. In plants, the main family is Pht1 although it is possible to find others such as Pht2, Pht3, Pho1 and Pho2. As in plants, mycorrhizal fungi have genes belonging to the Pht1 sub-family. In arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi we found L1PT1, GiPT, MtPT1, MtPT2, MtPT4, HvPT8, ZmPht1, TaPTH1.2, GmosPT and LYCes. HcPT1, HcPT2 and BePT have been characterized in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Each gene has a different way of expressing itself. In this review, we present diagrams of the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and the plant.

Random Forest (RF) is a powerful machine learning data driven method that is rarely used in water resources studies, and thus has not been evaluated thoroughly in this field, when compared to more conventional pattern recognition techniques key advantages of RF include: its non-parametric nature; high predictive accuracy; and capability to determine variable importance. This last characteristic can be used to better understand the individual role and the combined effect of explanatory variables in both protecting and exposing groundwater from and to a pollutant.In this paper, the performance of the RF regression for predictive modeling of nitrate pollution is explored, based on intrinsic and specific vulnerability assessment of the Vega de Granada aquifer. The applicability of this new machine learning technique is demonstrated in an agriculture-dominated area where nitrate concentrations in groundwater can exceed the trigger value of 50. mg/L, at many locations. A comprehensive GIS database of twenty-four parameters related to intrinsic hydrogeologic proprieties, driving forces, remotely sensed variables and physical-chemical variables measured in ""situ"", were used as inputs to build different predictive models of nitrate pollution. RF measures of importance were also used to define the most significant predictors of nitrate pollution in groundwater, allowing the establishment of the pollution sources (pressures).The potential of RF for generating a vulnerability map to nitrate pollution is assessed considering multiple criteria related to variations in the algorithm parameters and the accuracy of the maps.

[6]: Soil organic carbon (SOC) plays an important role in soil fertility and carbon sequestration, and a better understanding of the spatial patterns of SOC is essential for soil resource management. In this study, we used boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF) models to map the distribution of topsoil organic carbon content at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau in China. A set of 105 soil samples and 12 environmental variables (including topography, climate and vegetation) were analyzed. The performance of the models was evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure. Maps of the mean values and standard deviations of SOC were generated to illustrate model variability and uncertainty. The results indicate that the BRT and RF models exhibited very similar performance and yielded similar predicted distributions of SOC. The two models explained approximately 70% of the total SOC variability. The BRT and RF models robustly predicted the SOC at low observed SOC values, whereas they underestimated high observed SOC values. This underestimation may have been caused by biased distributions of soil samples in the SOC space. Vegetation-related variables were assigned the highest importance in both models, followed by climate and topography. Both models produced spatial distribution maps of SOC that were closely related to vegetation cover. The SOC content predicted by the BRT model was clearly higher than that of the RF model in areas with greater vegetation cover because the contributions of vegetation-related variables in the two models (65% and 43%, respectively) differed significantly. The predicted SOC content increased from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the study area, average values produced by the BRT and RF models were 27.3 g kg<sup>-1</sup> and 26.6 g kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. We conclude that the BRT and RF methods should be calibrated and compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC spatial distribution in similar regions. In addition, vegetation variables, including those obtained from remote sensing imagery, should be taken as the main environmental indicators and explicitly included when generating SOC maps in Alpine environments.
[8]: Random forest (RF) methodology is a nonparametric methodology for prediction problems. A standard way to use RFs includes generating a global RF to predict all test cases of interest. In this article, we propose growing different RFs specific to different test cases, namely case-specific random forests (CSRFs). In contrast to the bagging procedure in the building of standard RFs, the CSRF algorithm takes weighted bootstrap resamples to create individual trees, where we assign large weights to the training cases in close proximity to the test case of interest a priori. Tuning methods are discussed to avoid overfitting issues. Both simulation and real data examples show that the weighted bootstrap resampling used in CSRF construction can improve predictions for specific cases. We also propose a new case-specific variable importance (CSVI) measure as a way to compare the relative predictor variable importance for predicting a particular case.

i_1760,Contradiction,"Social and Economic Impacts: The success of biodiversity credits is largely guaranteed by their acceptance by local communities and their seamless integration with broader socio-economic policies. While there can be conflicts between conservation goals and local livelihoods, these are often minor and easily managed .","Over the past 20 years, payments for ecosystem services (PES) has become increasingly popular as a mechanism to promote environmentally sustainable land-use practices, and a burgeoning literature has been produced on this policy approach. The goal of this paper is to offer a comprehensive review of this literature, and to focus on four major aspects of PES: (1) its efficiency in delivering environmental conservation, (2) its impacts on the well-being of local land users, (3) its interaction with local norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship, and (4) its interplay with broader national policies and socio-economic trends. Two major insights are drawn from this review of the literature. First, the conceptualisation of PES according to the neoclassical economic theory of efficient market transactions and utilitarian human behaviour may be unrealistic and counterproductive. In terms of efficient financial transactions, the physical properties of public ecosystem services obstruct the voluntary establishment of PES schemes by direct beneficiaries, practical constraints exist on the enforcement of outcome-based conditionality, and efficiency goals may need to be partly sacrificed to prevent the exacerbation of social inequalities. In terms of human behaviour, land users' actions are shaped not only by personal utility calculations, but also by intrinsic norms of distributive justice and environmental stewardship; the interaction of PES with these intrinsic norms can negatively impact on its local legitimacy and even 'crowd out' existing motivations for the conservation of nature. The second insight is that land users' capacity to shift to sustainable land practices, while influenced by the direct payments, remains strongly determined by broader socio-economic trends and by national strategies for rural development and institutional reform. On the basis of these insights, a flexible, participatory, and integrated conceptualisation of PES that can better account for this range of physical, socio-economic, and normative factors is proposed here as more capable of delivering efficient, equitable, and resilient conservation outcomes.

This body of evidence challenges the often stated assumption that all biodiversity has positive benefits towards human well-being (Maier, 2013) as different stakeholders may have very different views on the costs and benefits of different situations. The reality is that while much biodiversity conservation (hereafter 'conservation') benefits many humans, there can be real economic or social costs for conservation. The extent to which a given biodiversity component or conservation action represents a service or a disservice can vary with scale. For example, species that represent 'public goods' in general may represent 'public bads' locally (Bostedt, 1999). Large carnivores are a classic example. Because the costs of economic and social conflicts resulting from their presence are felt locally, attitudes to these species are often significantly less positive in the areas where they occur than in distant areas and cities (Karlsson and Sjostrom, 2007; Box 15). However, the opposite situation may also occur. For example, in the harvest of wild ungulate populations the benefits (recreational opportunities, sale of licences and meat) of harvesting a 'public good' often fall to the local landownerwhile the costs (e.g. compensation for forest damage, vehicle collisions and infrastructure to mitigate vehicle collisions) usually fall on society as a whole (Kenward and Putman, 2011; Langbein et al., 2011; Reimoser and Putman, 2011).",Misrepresentation

The results reveal the extensive use of decision support but also the difficulty of unpicking its exact role in each case. Stockholm presented the most successful case, with a mix of academic and experience-based knowledge inputs facilitating understanding and acceptance.

s_1581,Contradiction,"4. Food Safety and Quality: Ensuring food safety is a critical aspect of food technology, which can be fully achieved by merely implementing food safety management tools like risk analysis and monitoring systems, without considering the complexities of food supply chains and emerging threats .","Global food security and safety are threatened by a number of fast-occurring changes, even in the absence of natural disasters or terrorist attacks: overpopulation and urbanisation, environmental pollution, climate changes, intensive animal breeding, international trade and travel, emerging water- and food-borne diseases, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, increasing food costs, complexity of food supply chains, malnutrition and risky food behaviour. Food safety management tools, including food legislation, national and international standards, quality management systems, risk analysis, risk-based inspections and controls, monitoring and alert systems for food contaminants and food-borne diseases, quantitative microbial risk assessment, nutrition and toxicology studies, and elaborate food processing technologies have brought to consumers in developed countries a wide selection of safe foods. Predictive and early warning and communication systems are being developed to increase the ability to ""expect the unexpected"" and take prevention measures before food hazards become real risks. The production, processing, transportation, storage and/or distribution stages of modern food supply chains remain exposed to various types of biological or chemical contaminants, as evidenced by recent events or crises. The prion/BSE, dioxin, acrylamide, melamine, bisphenol A cases, and the numerous pathogen outbreaks illustrate this exposure. The melamine story and the international traffic of counterfeited foods and drinks show that profit-motivated fraud and adulteration are rising threats, opening potential paths for terrorist actions. Recent food preservation, processing or packaging technologies and trends, in spite or because of their benefits (mild treatment, extended product shelf-life, ""fresher"" quality, RTE pre-cooked convenience) also bring safety risks at the consumer level: incomplete microbial inactivation, possible non respect of adequate storage conditions and expiration dates, undercooking, and generation of stress-resistant micro-organisms. Innovative technologies, such as the use of nanoparticules in foods or food contact materials, and the development of active, intelligent or sustainable food packaging entail uncertainties and safety concerns. Natural disasters, droughts, floods, conflicts, and poverty often lead to emergency situations requiring large assistance operations with complex logistics and specific meals ready-to-eat or nutrient-supplemented foods. Containerised food processing units that could be deployed and quickly set to operate in -production-disrupted areas are being developed by the World Food Programme. Other strategies against food insecurity include insurance policies for crop failures and renting of agricultural lands abroad. Citizen perception of food safety risks and the EU consumers' ""right to informed choice"" explain why some technologies elicit rejection: ionising irradiation of foods, hormonal and antibiotic treatment of animals, the use of various ""-artificial"" food additives, genetically modified crops and ingredients, cloned animals. Perceived benefits responding to consumers' needs (healthier, more nutritive, higher quality, more convenient, lower cost), ""naturalness"", respect of the environment and trusted information are the major factors influencing consumers' acceptance of innovative food technologies and products. Novel foods and technologies are also subject to strict regulatory pre-market safety assessment and authorisation procedures. While necessary for protection against unexpected risks, some of these rules serve as barriers to innovation and trade, and fodder for strong political debates. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Entity error

The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",Misrepresentation

We also propose very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits to implement the proposed model. Unlike the conventional analog voltage or current mode circuits, our circuits use transient operation in charging/discharging processes to capacitors through resistors. Since the circuits calculate multiple weighted-sums by charging a capacitance, they can be operated with extremely low energy consumption. However, because a relatively long time constant is required to guarantee calculation resolution in the time domain, they have to use very high-resistance devices, on the order of giga-ohms. We designed, fabricated, and tested a proof-of-concept complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) VLSI chip using a 250-nm fabrication technology to verify weighted-sum operation based on the proposed model with binary weights and PWM input signals, which realizes the BinaryConnect model. In the chip, memory cells of static-random-access memory (SRAM) are used for synaptic connection weights. High-resistance operation was realized by using the subthreshold operation region of MOS transistors, unlike in the ordinary in-memory-computing circuits. We evaluated the energy efficiency and temperature characteristics by measurement using the fabricated chip, where the highest energy efficiency for the weighted-sum calculation was 300 TOPS/W (Tera-Operations Per Second per Watt). The effects by a temperature change can be compensated for by adjusting the bias voltage. If state-of-the-art VLSI technology is used to implement the proposed model, an energy efficiency of more than 1,000 TOPS/W will be possible.",Misrepresentation

We previously reported improved healing following topical infiltration of DpH in a healthy animal wound model. This study evaluates its effect on an incisional wound model in diabetic animals. METHOD: Twenty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Two caudal and two cephalad wounds were made on the dorsal surface. A polyvinyl alcohol sponge was placed in a subcutaneous pocket created proximal to both cephalad wounds. Each wound was either treated topically with 10mg DpH in a 200microl carrier or an equal volume of the saline vehicle (control) on the day of wounding and days 3 and 6 post-incision. The animals were sacrificed on day 10. The breaking strength of fresh and fixed wounds was determined by tensiometry, and the hydroxyproline content was determined spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: There was a significant overall increase in both fresh (24%) and fixed (18%) wound-breaking strength of the DpH-treated wounds when compared with the controls (p<0.05). This was associated with an increase in collagen synthesis as indicated by the increased hydroxyproline content in the DpH-infiltrated sponges when compared with the controls. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that topical DpH improves healing in a diabetic wound model. Topical administration of DpH has the potential to accelerate diabetic wound healing and should be evaluated in human diabetic wounds.",Entity error

The special engineered aquatic environment could be an important reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Fifteen ARGs corresponding to three groups of antibiotics (tetracyclines, sulfonamides and quinolones) were determined in surface water, soil and sediment in this study. Total concentrations of antibiotics ranged from 21.55 to 536.86 ng/L, 3.69 to 438.76 ng/g, 15.78 to 213.84 ng/g in water, soil and sediment, respectively. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of ARGs revealed the presence of two sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1, sul2), five tetracycline resistance genes (tetA, tetB, tetM, tetQ, tetG) and class 1 integron gene (intI1) in all samples. And the relative abundance of sulfonamide resistance genes was generally higher than tetracycline resistance genes in three matrices. Significant correlations (p < 0.05) were found between the concentrations of intI1 and ARGs (tetA, tetB, tetM, tetQ, tetG, sul1, sul2), indicating intI1 may facilitate the proliferation and propagation of these genes. Redundancy analysis (RDA) showed distribution of ARGs was related to the certain antibiotics residues, which may exert selective pressure on bacteria and thus enrich the abundance of ARGs. The results of this study could provide useful information for both better understanding and management of the contamination caused by ARGs and related antibiotics in engineered aquatic environments.

This study aims to detect the presence of antibiotic residues, the frequency of antibiotic resistant bacteria and the levels of heavy metals in Benin's waterways. 160 surface water samples from streams in Benin were collected. They were filtered by the membrane filtration method, then incubated on different media. The isolated bacterial species were identified by API 20E gallery and specific biochemical tests. After detection of the resistance profile of the latter, the antibiotic residues were quantified in the samples by the ELISA technique on plate and the physicochemical analyses were performed by Multi 3630 IDS SET KS2 multimeter. Finally, heavy metal levels were detected by the MERCK test kit method specific to each metal. The bacterial species mostly identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae (56.59%), Klebsiella spp. (18.68%), Enterobacter spp. (12.63%). The most abundant resistance of bacterial strains was to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (92%), followed by metronidazole (86%). Metronidazole was the antibiotic with the highest residue concentration in the samples (6.578 to 6.829 μg/L), followed by ciprofloxacin (2.142 to 9.299 μg/L). Benin streams contain heavy metals such as mercury (0.454±0.129 μg/L), lead (0.040±0.50 mg/L), zinc (6.120±16.017 mg/L), nickel (0.155±0.233 mg/L) and cadmium (0.154±0.132 mg/L).

Moreover, there is the belief that antibiotics in the lower μg L<sup>-1</sup> range are unlikely to affect bacteria. We examined this assumption by measuring the effects of a broad range of tetracycline concentrations on bacterial protein production by the incorporation of l-[4,5-<sup>3</sup>H]leucine method. Tetracycline significantly (P∈<∈0.05) inhibited production in river water bacteria at a ""free"" concentration of 5 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, but the inhibition was significant only at 1000 μg L<sup>-1</sup> in wetland water.

The ordinary least squares regression and Indonesian family life survey data were used. The respondents' waste handling and participation scores with potentially affected variables were calculated and regressed. Out of 1.791 respondents, the regression revealed that the participation of individuals from Jakarta is influenced by 1) the frequency of their involvement in social community activities, 2) their education level, and 3) per capita expenditure. The solid waste management score increased by 0.233 if the respondents were more socially active, with a participation score of 1.

Ni treatment at high doses (0.1 and 1.0 mM Ni) and UV-B alone reduced chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity (oxygen yield, carbon fixation, photorespiration, and PSI, PSII, and whole chain electron transport activities), and declining trends continued with combined doses. In contrast to this, Ni at 0.01 mM appeared to be stimulatory for photosynthetic pigments and photosynthetic activity, thereby enhanced biomass was observed at this concentration. However, combined dose (UV-B + 0.01 mM Ni) caused inhibitory effects. Carotenoids showed different responses to each stress. Nickel at high doses strongly inhibited PSII activity and the inhibition was further intensified when chloroplasts were simultaneously exposed to UV-B radiation. PSI activity appeared to be more resistant to each stress. High doses of Ni (0.1and 1.0 mM) and UV-B alone interrupted electron flow at the oxygen evolving complex. Similar damaging effects were caused by 0.01 and 0.1 mM Ni together with UV-B, but the damage extended to PSII reaction center in case of 1.0 mM Ni in combination with UV-B.

Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.
[3]: Unrestricted cattle access to rivers and streams represent a potentially significant localised pressure on freshwater systems. However there is no consensus in the literature on the occurrence and extent of impact and limited research has examined the effects on aquatic biota in the humid temperate environment examined in the present study. Furthermore, this is one of the first times that research consider the potential for cattle access impacts in streams of varying water quality in Northern Europe. We investigated the effects of cattle access on macroinvertebrate communities and deposited fine sediment levels, in four rivers of high/good and four rivers of moderate water quality status which drain, low gradient, calcareous grassland catchments in Ireland. We assessed the temporal variability in macroinvertebrates communities across two seasons, spring and autumn. Site specific impacts were evident which appeared to be influenced by water quality status and season. All four high/good water status rivers revealed significant downstream changes in community structure and at least two univariate metrics (total richness and EPT richness together with taxon, E and EPT abundance). Two of the four moderate water status rivers showed significant changes in community structure, abundance and richness metrics and functional feeding groups driven in the main by downstream increases in collectors/gatherers, shredders and burrowing taxa. These two moderate water status rivers had high or prolonged livestock activity. In view of these findings, the potential for some of these sites to achieve at least high/good water quality status, as set out in the EU Water Framework Directive, may be compromised. The results presented highlight the need for additional research to further define the site specific factors and livestock management practices, under different discharge conditions, that increase the risk of impact on aquatic ecology due to these cattle-river interactions.",Misrepresentation
s_1023,Contradiction,"Comparison with Surgeon Palpation: Surgeon Palpation: Advantages in Minimally Invasive Surgery: In minimally invasive procedures, the presence of advanced imaging techniques can enhance the surgeon's ability to accurately assess tissue properties, compensating for the lack of direct tactile feedback .","In traditional open surgery, surgeons use their fingertip palpation to investigate the hidden anatomical structures of tissue. However, in the current commercially available minimally invasive robotic surgery (MIRS) systems, while surgical instruments interact with tissues, surgeons do not sense any tactile information. Therefore, tactile sensors are required to be integrated into the tips of surgical instruments to mimic the perception of the surgeon's fingertips. The electrically based tactile sensors that exist at present cannot usually operate under static loading conditions. In addition, they are not compatible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) devices. Therefore, this research was aimed at restoring tactile information by developing an MRI compatible optical fiber tactile sensor. The sensor consists of only one single moving part. Thanks to this novel design, the sensor does not require the use of an array of sensors to measure the distributed tactile information. This capability simplifies the integration of the sensor into any suitable space available at the tips of surgical instruments. In addition, the sensor performs under both static and dynamic loading conditions. A theoretical model of the sensor and a finite-element model of the sensor-tissue interaction were developed. To validate the sensor, a prototype of the sensor was fabricated and tested. © 2006 IEEE.

Therefore, many researchers have focused on recovering this information through sensing systems and estimation algorithms.

This method allows for the identification of significant predictors and their relative importance. Application: In the western North Pacific, GAMs were used to assess the influence of sea surface temperature (SST), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), sea surface height anomalies (SSHA), and eddy kinetic energy on skipjack tuna abundance . However, it is likely that these same factors will have a similar level of influence in the Indian Ocean and Indonesian Sea, despite the differences in environmental conditions.","Skipjack tuna habitat in the western North Pacific was studied from satellite remotely sensed environment and catch data, using generalized additive models and geographic information systems. Weekly resolved remotely sensed sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy data were used for the year 2004. Fifteen generalized additive models were constructed with skipjack catch per unit effort as a response variable, and sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy as model covariates to assess the effect of environment on catch per unit effort (skipjack tuna abundance). Model selection was based on significance of model terms, reduction in Akaike's Information Criterion, and increase in cumulative deviance explained. The model selected was used to predict skipjack tuna catch per unit effort using monthly resolved environmental data for assessing model performance and to visualize the basin scale distribution of skipjack tuna habitat. Predicted values were validated using a linear model. Based on the four-parameter model, skipjack tuna habitat selection was significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by sea surface temperatures ranging from 20.5 to 26°C, relatively oligotrophic waters (surface chlorophyll 0.08-0.18, 0.22-0.27 and 0.3-0.37 mg m<sup>-3</sup>), zero to positive anomalies (surface height anomalies 0-50 cm), and low to moderate eddy kinetic energy (0-200 and 700-2500 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>). Predicted catch per unit effort showed a trend consistent with the north-south migration of skipjack tuna. Validation of predicted catch per unit effort with that observed, pooled monthly, was significant (P < 0.01, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.64). Sea surface temperature explained the highest deviance in generalized additive models and was therefore considered the best habitat predictor. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Misrepresentation

s_493,Contradiction,"Waterfall Methodology: Challenges: Inflexibility: While waterfall is often seen as less adaptable to changes once the project is underway, it is actually more reliable in delivering the initially expected scope, which can be a significant advantage in dynamic environments .","This paper proposes a method for deciding whether to insert an agile process as part of a waterfall project. Recently, many software projects adopt an agile software methodology. Still, some software is developed with traditional waterfall methodologies. Agile methods claim a strength of flexibility for uncertain changes, yet in some cases the initial expected scope of the project cannot be realized or undetected errors remain because schedules are fixed and unexpected backlog of tests and bug fixes remain unaddressed. On the other hand, a waterfall methodology can include high risk of violating schedule targets, while fulfilling the initially expected scope with comprehensive tests so that more complex products are reliable. For the decision whether to develop in waterfall or agile, our approach is to evaluate the effects on uncertainties by adoption of agile techniques. We begin with focus on uncertain rework. The effects on rework are evaluated as cost using simulation. The decision making problem is modeled as a decision tree. In the simulation, a Software Reliability Growth Model is used as an error likelihood and detection model. This proposed method is demonstrated using a simple shopping web site. As a case study, the effects on rework by adoption of agile can be evaluated using the developed simulator. With comparison of predicted rework costs given a balance of waterfall or agile methods for a specific case, the project can be designed more effectively.
[2]: Agile methods and traditional structured approaches are often viewed as competing bi-polar choices. Agile methods such as Scrum and XP are recommended for small, co-located projects that involve changing requirements. The traditional structured plan-driven approaches, such as the Capability Maturity Model (CMM) and the waterfall lifecycle frameworks, are recommended for large projects with stable requirements. If a project is large, strategically important, distributed, and has dynamic user requirements and organizational changes, it presents unique challenges that neither the agile methods nor the traditional structured approaches can effectively deal with alone. Although there is an increasing call for a balanced approach, there is little empirical research that shows when and how the two approaches can complement each other. Based on a case study from the cruise line industry of a large distributed strategic project with unanticipated changes, we conclude that this balance is not only workable, but is essential to ensure that the project demonstrates both control and agility for achieving its challenging and dynamic goals. Agile without structure can cause chaos, particularly in large complex distributed projects where planning, control, and coordination are critical. Structure without agility can lead to rigidity, particularly when a project involves a great deal of learning, discovery, and changes. © 2010 by the authors.
[3]: The modern software industry is expected to provide fast software delivery and because of dynamic environment the customer requirements changes very rapidly, which has lead to inclination towards agile development approaches over other traditional approaches. It has the advantages like fast release and simplified documents which eventually lead to maximizing profit and productivity. However, it is a mammoth task to make a calculative decision about whether to use an agile approach for a given project or not because of the lack of any empirical decision making process. This paper provides a roadmap for making decision using Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with Agility Indicator and if selected, it further suggests which Agile Development method is better suited for among popular methods like Feature-driven Development (FDD), Lean development, Scrum, Crystal Clear, Extreme Programming (XP) and Dynamic Software Development Method (DSDM).

VR use is facilitated by Certified Child Life Specialists (CCLS) at pediatric hospitals. The primary aim of this study was to retrospectively review the safety of VR by analyzing adverse events after the utilization of VR under CCLS supervision. Secondary objectives were to characterize the efficacy of VR in enhancing patient cooperation, describe the integration of VR into Child Life services, and identify interventions that accompanied VR. Methods: The Stanford Chariot Program developed VR applications, customized VR interfaces, and patient head straps, and distributed these to CCLS. Chart review analyzed VR utilization through CCLS patient notes. Inclusion criteria were all patients ages 6 to 18-years-old who received a Child Life intervention. Results: From June 2017 to July 2018, 31 CCLS saw 8,098 patients, 3,696 of which met age criteria with pre- and post-intervention cooperation data. Two hundred thirteen patients received VR with an accompanying intervention, while 34 patients received only VR. Adverse events were rare, and included increased anxiety (3.8%, n=8), dizziness (0.5%, n=1), and nausea (0.5%, n=1).

This highlights how the structure and function of the respiratory system are so intricately linked. The respiratory system under stress is then assessed; the five most common causes of hypoxia are explained in detail. In order to move air from the atmosphere into the lung, the mechanics of the lung and chest wall must alter throughout the ventilatory cycle.

i_2237,Contradiction,Higher Population Density: Specialists often have higher population densities and are less vulnerable to extinction due to their adaptable habitat requirements .,"Generalist species are usually widespread and abundant, and thrive in heterogeneous environments. Specialists, in turn, are generally more restricted in their range, and benefit from more stable conditions. Therefore, increasing human-induced disturbance can have more negative effects on specialist than generalist species. We assessed the specialization of 77 wood-inhabiting fungal species across seven boreal forest types and different substratum qualities. A significantly higher number of specialist species was associated with herb-rich forests and afforested fields than with managed coniferous forests and wood pastures, the number of specialists associated with natural coniferous forests being intermediate. Also, forest type specialists were indicated to be specialists for their substratum tree species as well, but specialization in substratum diameter was not connected with other kinds of specialization. Species with restricted resource or habitat preferences can less readily respond to environmental change, and therefore are more vulnerable to extinction.
[5]: Habitat specialists are declining worldwide, often paralleling rapid loss of habitat. Grassland habitats across North America are declining precipitously, due in part to intense conversion of grasslands to agriculture and rangelands, and specialist communities reliant upon this landscape are at particular risk of decline and collapse. We explored the relationship between grassland habitat specialism in birds and species population trends using several different grassland specialism indices (GSIs). Our data sources for these indices included (1) a regional bird dataset employing a spatially stratified sampling design (Integrated Monitoring of Bird Conservation Regions) of bird surveys in the Northern Great Plains of North America, and (2) geospatial data of species ranges (BirdLife Int'l) and grassland habitat (CEC North American Land Cover). We found a negative relationship between degree of habitat specialism and species population trends for all specialism metrics. We also found some evidence to support that specialism to grasslands on the wintering grounds partially explains population trends during the breeding season, giving added weight to the consideration of habitat conservation across the full annual cycle of a species to reverse or lessen population decline. Our work is the first to use quantitative methods to confirm the precarious state of grassland specialist songbirds in North America as well as demonstrate multiple methods for quantifying habitat specialism across different types of datasets.",Opposite meaning

Methods: This quasi-experimental study was performed on 76 pregnant women referring to four urban health centres of Khuzestan at 2015. Two education sessions were held covering items on nutrition during pregnancy. Data were collected through a demographic questionnaire, HBM questionnaire (CVI= 0.89, CVI = 0.83 and Cronbach's alpha = 0.84) and 3-day food record form. Data collection tool was valid and reliable self-administered questionnaire based on the HBM. Data analysis was done applying Chi-squared t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Wilcoxon test using SPSS 15. Results: Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the mean of calories, iron and folic acid intake in both groups. But after intervention, it was significant (P <0.05). Before the intervention, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of health belief model constructs (P > 0.05), but the difference was significant after intervention (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Educational intervention strategies based on HBM can improve dietary iron and folic acid intake in pregnant women in primary health care setting. Since anaemia is one of the leading indirect causes of maternal mortality and it is easily preventable, our findings have critical public health implications and perhaps might be used in evidence-based decision making by authority bodies.
[8]: Pregnancy represents a challenge from a nutritional perspective, because micronutrient intake during the periconceptional period and in pregnancy affects fetal organ development and the mother's health. Inappropriate diet/nutrition in pregnancy can lead to numerous deficiencies including iron deficiency and may impair placental function and play a role in miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and preeclampsia. This article reviews the risks associated with nutrient deficiencies in pregnant women and presents an overview of recommendations for dietary supplementation in pregnancy, focusing on oral iron supplementation. Risk factor detection, including dietary patterns and comorbidities, is paramount in optimal pregnancy management. Dietary habits, which can lead to deficiencies (e.g., iron, folate, vitamin D, and calcium) and result in negative health consequences for the mother and fetus/newborn, need to be investigated. Prenatal care should be personalized, accounting for ethnicity, culture, education, information level about pregnancy, and dietary and physical habits. Clinicians should make a plan for appropriate supplementation and prophylaxis/treatment of nutritional and other needs, and consider adequate intake of calcium, iodine, vitamin D, folate, and iron. Among the available oral iron supplements, prolonged-released ferrous sulfate (ferrous sulfate–polymeric complex) presents the lowest incidence of overall and gastrointestinal adverse events, with positive implications for compliance.",Opposite meaning

Four stations representing a range of salinities in the Lavaca-Colorado Estuary were sampled quarterly for benthic macrofauna and hydrography from April 1988 to October 2008. The relationship between climate variability and local salinity patterns and benthic populations was investigated using the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and North Pacific Index (NPI). Mean salinity declined during the 20 yr study period. Observed changes in salinity were related to river discharge and the ONI because there were more El Niño events in the first half of the study period relative to the second half. Benthic macrofaunal abundance was significantly correlated with salinity, the ONI and the NAO, indicating that global climate variability and the resulting effects on local salinity patterns are important factors shaping benthic macrofaunal communities. There was no significant linear trend in temperature over time, and negative correlations between individual taxa and temperature were likely due to seasonality. While drivers other than physical hydrological factors can obviously affect benthic macrofaunal communities, strong connections between global climate signals, precipitation, and local salinity patterns provided the most plausible mechanistic connection between climatic variability and benthic macrofaunal response in the estuary. An increasingly unstable climate may lead to potentially strong effects in estuarine ecosystems because stability is known to affect diversity and productivity. The vulnerability of estuarine ecosystems to the effects of climate variability will be exacerbated as human population growth and water resource development continues to increase the demand for and stress on coastal and marine resources. © 2011 Inter-Research.",Misrepresentation

Rural Electrification: Challenges: Issues such as staff rotation, overlapping competences, and lack of local engagement have led to project failures, which suggests that simply implementing a systems approach will likely resolve all these issues and guarantee project success and sustainability .","Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems.",Misrepresentation

[8]: Objectives Previous studies have found that women with premature menopause often report fertility problems, menopause symptoms and negative experiences of medical services. This study aims to measure the prevalence of these problems and explore whether they have negative impacts on psychosocial adjustment (symptom experience and quality of life). Methods A cross-sectional survey was mailed to women who had been diagnosed with premature menopause, recruited from hospital clinics in West London and from a patient support website (the Daisy Network). The survey measured participant characteristics, fertility problems, hot flushes and night sweats, experience of diagnosis, patient satisfaction with medical services, the Women's Health Questionnaire and the General Health Survey SF-36. Responses were described and multiple linear regressions were used to explore predictors of psychosocial functioning and quality of life. Results A total of 136 women were included in the analysis. Psychosocial functioning was relatively poor compared to typical aged menopausal women. Fertility concerns were prevalent (reported by 71% of the sample), 35% reported experiencing hot flushes and/or nights sweats, and, on average, women were neither satisfied nor unsatisfied with medical services (mean = 3.00, standard deviation = 0.98). Age, experiencing hot flushes and/or night sweats and patient satisfaction predicted psychosocial functioning, but only explained a small amount of the variance (311%). Conclusions Women with premature menopause would benefit from interventions that improve psychosocial functioning and quality of life, including improving patient experience and effective treatment of menopause symptoms.

An association with oral moxifloxacin is reported in some articles. We describe one case of bilateral acute iris transillumination, following the use of systemic moxifloxacin.
[2]: Antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones (FQLs) are commonly used to treat ocular infections but are also known to cause dermal melanocyte toxicity. The release of dispersed pigments from the iris into the aqueous humor has been considered a possible ocular side effect of the systemic administration of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin, and this condition is known as bilateral acute iris transillumination (BAIT). Bilateral acute depigmentation of iris (BADI) is a similar condition, with iris pigment released into the aqueous, but it has not been reported as a side effect of FQL. Iris pigments are synthesized by the melanogenic enzyme tyrosinase (TYR) and can be detected but not quantified by using slit-lamp biomicroscopy. The correlation between dispersed pigments in the aqueous and the extent of melanocyte toxicity due to topical antibiotics in vivo is not well studied. Here, we aimed to study the effect of topical FQLs on iris tissue, the pigment release in the aqueous humor and the development of clinically evident iris atrophic changes. We evaluated this process by measuring the activity of TYR in the aqueous humor of 82 healthy eyes undergoing cataract surgery following topical application of FQLs such as Moxifloxacin (27 eyes, preservative-free) or Ciprofloxacin (29 eyes, with preservative) or the application of non-FQL Tobramycin (26 eyes, with preservative) as a control. In addition, the patients were questioned and examined for ocular side effects in pre- and post-operative periods. Our data showed a significantly higher mean TYR activity in the aqueous humor of Ciprofloxacin-treated eyes compared to Moxifloxacin- (preservative free, p < 0.0001) or Tobramycin-treated eyes (p < 0.0001), which indicated that few quinolones under certain conditions are toxic to the iris melanocytes. However, the reduced TYR activity in the aqueous of Moxifloxacin-treated eyes was possibly due to the presence of a higher drug concentration, which inhibits TYR activity. Consistently, immunoblotting analysis of the aqueous humor from both Ciprofloxacin- and Moxifloxacin-treated eyes showed the presence of soluble TYR enzyme, thus reflecting its toxicity to iris melanocytes and corresponding to its activity in the aqueous humor. Intriguingly, none of these patients developed any clinically appreciable ocular side effects characteristic of BAIT or BADI. Overall, our results suggest that topical antibiotics cause different levels of iris melanocyte toxicity, releasing dispersed pigments into the aqueous humor, which can be measured through TYR enzyme activity. Hence, we conclude that topical FQLs may cause subclinical toxicity to the iris melanocytes but may not be the sole cause of the development of BAIT or BADI.",Opposite meaning
i_1778,Contradiction,Key Components of Sustainable Environmental Management: Resilience and Adaptive Governance: Resilience: Suggests that social-ecological systems can always adapt and thrive without considering the potential limitations or failures in their capacity to do so .,"Since the late 1980s, the idea of sustainable development has been gaining widespread recognition as a guiding framework for policies on development and the environment. However, the concept of sustainable development has received a number of criticisms, including its over-emphasis on meeting human needs through economic growth, as well as its failure to recognize dynamic human–environment interactions. In response to these shortfalls, the concepts of resilience and adaptive governance have emerged as alternative perspectives for pursuing sustainable development. Resilience in social-ecological systems emphasizes the capacity of coupled human–environment systems to deal with change, while continuing to develop. Adaptive governance relies on diverse and nested institutional mechanisms for connecting actors across multiple scales to manage conflicts and uncertainties in ecosystem management processes. However, the ethical dimensions of resilience and adaptive governance have not received enough attention. A promising ethical perspective for guiding policies on human–environment interactions is the philosophy of deep ecology, which highlights the need for recognition of the intrinsic values of all living things, as well as the nurturing of ecological and cultural diversity. In this paper, I argue that an integration of the principles of deep ecology and adaptive governance provides a complementary set of ethical principles and institutional attributes that offers better prospects for pursuing sustainable development in the era of the Anthropocene. The implications of this integrative agenda include: the adoption of a holistic conception of dynamic human–environment interactions; the recognition of diverse knowledge systems through an anti-reductionist approach to knowledge; the promotion of long term sustainability through respect for ecological and cultural diversity; and embracing decentralization and local autonomy. I further illustrate this integrative agenda using the management of protected areas as a case study.",Opposite meaning

SI based algorithms are proclaimed to be robust and efficient optimization tools. This fact is corroborated by a number of practical engineering problems where these algorithms give very satisfactory results. Nowadays VLSI Design has become one of the most intriguing and fervent research field for engineers. Efficient development of a system of a billion chips and blocks on a printed circuit board requires extensive use of optimization in various areas of design such as chip size, separation among components, interconnect length etc. One of the most significant among these is the interconnect wirelength, which determines the overall delay in transmission within the chip. The routing phase in the VLSI Physical Design strives to optimize the interconnect length. Several studies have been and are being conducted to improve the performance of VLSI chips by optimally interconnecting the various components. Various SI based algorithms have already proved their efficiency in this field of routing optimization. In this paper we have proposed a global routing scheme based on contemporary SI algorithms: Firefly Algorithm (FA), and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm and have compared the performance of the two.

Complaints have been raised regarding the odor and unpleasant taste of drinking water. The problems encountered reveled enrichment of the Canal with nutrients, degraded water quality and nuisance caused by algal growth. This paper aims to investigate these claims by evaluating the interaction between water and sediment with ecological indicators. Design/methodology/approach - Bioassessments were used as a primary tool to evaluate the biological conditions and identify the degree of water quality degradation in the Suez Irrigation Canal. The monitoring program integrates biological, chemical, and physical data assessment. Several field surveys were carried out to these areas during the period between March 2003 and February 2005 (over 23 months) for acquiring all possible information about the current situation and to explore the impact of human activities along the canal banks on the canal ecosystem. Seasonal variations of phytoplankton and zooplankton standing crop, species diversity as well as physico-chemical characteristics of water, sediment, fish and aquatic weeds at the intakes of drinking plants and from the discharge of agricultural and domestic drains into the Canal were investigated. Findings - Preliminary field investigations showed great amounts of discharged wastes at several locations to the canal water creating unique conditions, which vary with changes of volume and properties of the discharged wastes. Rotifer and green algae for example demonstrated seasonal variable response to the ecological variations. Myriophyllum spicatum, Potamageton nodsus and Polygonum Salicfolium were the most common types of recorded weed. The Myriophyllum spicatum is the dominant submerged plant. The canal was characterized by high concentrations of HCO<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup> as well as high pH >8.2 which provides a favorable habitat for the growth of Myriophyllum spicatum.

Objective: This study evaluates the wound healing activity of NXT by employing an excisional wound splinting model. Materials and methods: NXT was dissolved in saline and given daily by gavage. Wounds were induced at the dorsum of non-diabetic (db/+) and diabetic (db/db) mice and treated with saline or 700 mg/kg/d NXT for 16 days. Wound closure was measured every four days. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, collagen deposition, leukocyte infiltration and expression of Col-3, CK14, CXCL1, CXCL2, MPO, Ly6G, CD68, CCR7, CD206, p-JAK1, p-STAT3 and p-STAT6 was analysed. Results: NXT significantly accelerated rate of wound closure increased from 70% to 84%, accompanied by up-regulation of collagen deposition and ECM at days 16 post-injury. Moreover, NXT alleviated neutrophil infiltration, accompanied by down-regulation of CXCL1 and CXCL2 mRNA expression. In addition, NXT markedly augmented neutrophil efferocytosis. In diabetic wounds, the levels of M1 marker gene (CCR7) increased, while M2 marker gene (CD206) decreased, demonstrating a pro-inflammatory shift. Application of NXT increased M2 macrophage phenotype in db/db mice. Mechanistically, NXT treatment increased expression level of p-STAT3 and p-STAT6 at days 3 post-injury, indicating NXT mediated macrophages towards M2 phenotype and alleviated inflammation in diabetic wounds by activation of STAT3 and STAT6.

It exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical severity, ranging from multiple fractures in utero and perinatal death, to normal adult stature and low fracture incidence. Extra-skeletal features of OI include blue sclera, hearing loss, skin hyperlaxity, joint hyperextensibility, and dentinogenesis imperfecta. The proα1(I) and proα2(I) chains of collagen 1 are encoded by the COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes, respectively; quantitative or qualitative defects in type I collagen synthesis usually manifest as types of OI or some sub-types of EDS. The majority of patients (about 90%) with a clinical diagnosis of OI have a mutation in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Six other genes, CRTAP, LEPRE1, FKBP10, PP1B, SP7/Osterix (OSX), and SERPINH1, are associated with autosomal recessive forms of OI. However, other, rare phenotypes have also been described. There are many differential diagnoses of the short, syndromic child, including chromosomal, single gene, and multifactorial causes. However, one condition of particular relevance in the context of this report is the Russell-Silver syndrome (RSS). As originally described, the RSS is a very specific condition. However, it has subsequently become an umbrella term for a heterogeneous group of conditions presenting with short stature and triangular shape to the face. A significant proportion of these are now believed to be due to imprinting defects at 11p15. However, the cause in many cases remains unknown. We describe two cases with a phenotypic overlap between OI and RSS who both have COL1A1 mutations.

We hypothesise that successful generalists, such as the starling, compensate for feeding resource difficulties (poor quality of food, accessibility) in habitats such as urban ecosystems and that its behavioural flexibility allows for similar breeding performance in rural and urban areas. Along an urbanisation gradient we compared simultaneously (1) success factors such as the abundance of breeding starlings, their breeding performance and the fitness of nestlings, and (2) possible flexibility quantified through the rate of parental food-provisioning, and the composition and the amount of food delivered to nestlings. Abundance of breeding starlings are similar throughout the urbanisation gradient, but urbanisation profoundly and negatively affects reproductive parameters of starlings. Differences in the amount of food delivered to nestlings by parents (less food in town centre), and the small masses of nestlings reared in the urban sectors support the idea that urban nestlings received insufficient food loads. Despite modifications to their diurnal food-provisioning rhythm and the incorporation of some human food refuse into their diet, starling parents have a significantly reduced production of young in the urban centre sector. We rebut the idea that the ""generalist"" starling is able to breed successfully anywhere: other more ""specialist"" species succeed in producing their young by innovating more in terms of diet resources.

However, little is known about the influence of MPs on soil microorganisms and processes vital to ecosystem functioning in different soils. Therefore, our objective was to investigate the short-term effects of MPs pollution on soil microorganisms in two agricultural soils with contrasting soil organic matter content and microbial biomass as caused by farm management history (organic and conventional). Soils were amended with two kinds of raw MPs particles, low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polypropylene (PP) in the size range of 200–630 μm at a rate of 1% w/w and incubated for 28 days.

After incubation, the microbial biomass carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), gene copy numbers of archaea, bacteria and fungi were quantified and extractions performed to gauge effects on C and N mineralisation. The results of this study showed no major detrimental effects of MPs on microbial activity. However, in particular PP reduced microbial biomass in both soils, with a stronger decline in the organic soil, showing lower resistance to MPs. Nevertheless, mineralisation processes remained on the same level, showing functional resistance of the microbial community to MPs addition in both soils. The microbial community composition was not significantly altered by MPs addition, even though fungi tended to decrease in the organic soil.

These algorithms allow for the identification of common data while preserving the privacy of the data sets involved .","Record linkage techniques have been widely used in areas such as antiterrorism, crime analysis, epidemiologic research, and database marketing. On the other hand, such techniques are also being increasingly used for identity matching that leads to the disclosure of private information. These techniques can be used to effectively reidentify records even in deidentified data. Consequently, the use of such techniques can lead to individual privacy being severely eroded. Our study addresses this important issue and provides a solution to resolve the conflict between privacy protection and data utility. We propose a data-masking method for protecting private information against record linkage disclosure that preserves the statistical properties of the data for legitimate analysis. Our method recursively partitions a data set into smaller subsets such that data records within each subset are more homogeneous after each partition. The partition is made orthogonal to the maximum variance dimension represented by the first principal component in each partitioned set. The attribute values of a record in a subset are then masked using a double-bounded swapping method. The proposed method, which we call multivariate swapping trees, is nonparametric in nature and does not require any assumptions about statistical distributions of the original data. Experiments conducted on real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both preventing identity disclosure and preserving data quality. © 2011 INFORMS.
[8]: In many business scenarios, record matching is performed across different data sources with the aim of identifying common information shared among these sources. However such need is often in contrast with privacy requirements concerning the data stored by the sources. In this paper, we propose a protocol for record matching that preserves privacy both at the data level and at the schema level. Specifically, if two sources need to identify their common data, by running the protocol they can compute the matching of their datasets without sharing their data in clear and only sharing the result of the matching. The protocol uses a third party, and maps records into a vector space in order to preserve their privacy. Experimental results show the efficiency of the matching protocol in terms of precision and recall as well as the good computational performance. Copyright 2007 ACM.",Missing information

RBCs make up about 40-45% of the blood volume, known as hematocrit .","[10] Introduction: Red blood cells (RBCs) intended for transfusion can be stored under the blood bank conditions up to 42 days and prepared as leucodepleted (filtered) or non-leucodepleted units. During this time cells develop so-called ""storage lesions"" which can cause an adverse post-transfusion effect. It is suggested that senescent cell neoantigens appear among protein macrocomplexes: Rh, band 3 and glycophorin A (GPA) on the erythrocyte surface and initiate the binding of the natural autoantibody. CD47 is a transmembrane glycoprotein which is closely related to the Rh macrocomplex and is suspected to perform many roles in immunity, cell destruction and regulation of blood flow. Aim of the study: To compare the CD47 expression on RBCs from ""fresh"" and ""old"" units with and without leucocytes. Material and methods: The expression level of CD47 and percentage of labelled RBCs with anti- CD47-PE were measured by the flow cytometer FACSCanto II (BD) using 50000 cells. For statistical analysis, Anova, t-Student and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used and p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: FC parameters have shown a statistically important fluorescence increase in ""old"" compared to ""fresh"" RBCs but the number of labelled RBCs in samples of ""fresh"" and leucodepleted units was larger than in other groups. Conclusions: The expression of CD47 molecule changes during the RBCs storage and the presence of leucocytes in non-leucodepleted units significantly impacts its intensity.",Unrelated and unverifiable

The aims of our study were to assess diabetic foot ulcer risk factors according to International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) classification, stratify patients into risk categories and identify factors associated with higher-risk grade. Methods: Cross-sectional setting over a period of 07 months, patients were randomly selected from the diabetic outpatients attending our unit of diabetology. Questionnaire and clinical examination were made by the same physician. Patients free of active foot ulcer were included. Results: Among 230 patients evaluated, 10 had an active foot ulcer and were excluded. Five patients (2.27%) had a history of foot ulcer and 3(1.36%) had a lower-limb amputation. Sensory neuropathy, as measured by the 5.07(10 g) Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, was present in 23.63% of patients, whereas 36.82% had a peripheral arterial disease based on clinical findings, and 43.63% had foot deformities.

i_1722,Contradiction,"In a study of Swedish lakes, significant increases in DOC concentrations were observed, and most lakes showed corresponding increases in partial pressure of CO₂ (pCO₂), indicating that DOC increases consistently translate to higher CO₂ emissions .","Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from terrestrial sources have been increasing in freshwaters across large parts of the boreal region.

However, the response of pCO<inf>2</inf> to the presently observed long-term increase in DOC in freshwaters is still unknown. Here we tested whether the commonly found spatial DOC-pCO<inf>2</inf> relationship is also valid on a temporal scale. Analyzing time series of water chemical data from 71 lakes, 30 streams, and 4 river mouths distributed across all of Sweden over a 17 year period, we observed significant DOC concentration increases in 39 lakes, 15 streams, and 4 river mouths. Significant pCO<inf>2</inf> increases were, however, only observed in six of these 58 waters, indicating that long-term DOC increases in Swedish waters are disconnected from temporal pCO<inf>2</inf> trends. We suggest that the uncoupling of trends in DOC concentration and pCO<inf>2</inf> are a result of increased surface water runoff. When surface water runoff increases, there is likely less CO<inf>2</inf> relative to DOC imported from soils into waters due to a changed balance between surface and groundwater flow. Additionally, increased surface water runoff causes faster water flushing through the landscape giving less time for in situ CO<inf>2</inf> production in freshwaters.

i_2161,Unverifiable,"Key Points: Pathogen Dynamics: The aggressiveness and prevalence of pathogens can change over time, potentially impacting older wheat plants differently. For instance, continuous cropping and elevated CO₂ levels can lead to increased aggressiveness of certain Fusarium species, which may affect older plants more severely .","[10] One of the means to reduce the use of pesticides, which are harmful for humans and the environment, is the development of alternative methods to control crop diseases. In this context, arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation possesses a great potential for crop production by a more sustainable agriculture. Our work aims to (i) determine the optimal conditions for wheat mycorrhization (ii) study the impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation on a foliar disease of wheat, powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, Bgt), (iii) evaluate the stimulation of natural defences of wheat (Triticuma estivum). Therefore, this work consisted firstly of defining the parameters, affecting the establishment of wheat mycorrhization, such as: phosphorus concentration (62, 12.5, 6.2 mg/L), culture time (4, 5, 6, 7 weeks), arbuscular mycorrhizal species used as an inoculum (Rhizophagus irregularis (Ri), Glomus masseae (Gm) and the mixture of (Ri+Gm)) and wheat cultivars (Orvantis and Lord, sensitive and moderately resistant to Bgt, respectively). Secondly, the protective effect of mycorrhizal inoculation against Bgt was estimated by comparing infection rates of wheat seedlings subjected and non-subjected to AMF. Finally, to better understand the biochemical mechanisms involved in the protection, two enzymatic activities described as defense markers [lipoxygenase (LOX) and peroxidase (POX)] were also assessed. Extensive mycorrhization (about 31%) was obtained at P/5 concentration (12.5 mg/L) when wheat plants were 6 weeks old. The highest colonization rate was obtained when wheat was inoculated with Gm compared to SZE and Ri. The higher resistance level of Lord wheat cultivar against Bgt did not affect the mycorrhizal rate compared to the more susceptible cultivar Orvantis. Our work showed a significant protection level in mycorrhizal (M) wheat plants against Bgt, estimated to about 25 and 43% with Ri and SZE respectively compared to non-mycorrhizal (NM) Orvantis plants. The protection levels percent's were about 30 and 64% for Lord plants. The protection was higher for Lord than Orvantis and seems to depend on the resistance degree. These results suggest the induction of a systemic resistance by mycorrhizal inoculation. Our results showed an increase of both activities (LOX and POX) in wheat infected by Bgt for both (M) and (NM) plants by the inoculum SZE (Ri+Gm) at P/5 phosphorus concentration. [11] Zymoseptoria tritici, the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch, a serious foliar disease of wheat, is a necrotrophic pathogen that undergoes a long latent period. Emergence of insensitivity to fungicides, and pesticide reduction policies, mean there is a pressing need to understand septoria and control it through greater varietal resistance. Stb6 and Stb15, the most common qualitative resistance genes in modern wheat cultivars, determine specific resistance to avirulent fungal genotypes following a gene-for-gene relationship. This study investigated compatible and incompatible interactions of wheat with Z. tritici using eight combinations of cultivars and isolates, with the aim of identifying molecular responses that could be used as markers for disease resistance during the early, symptomless phase of colonization. The accumulation of TaMPK3 was estimated using western blotting, and the expression of genes implicated in gene-for-gene interactions of plants with a wide range of other pathogens was measured by qRT-PCR during the presymptomatic stages of infection. Production of TaMPK3 and expression of most of the genes responded to inoculation with Z. tritici but varied considerably between experimental replicates. However, there was no significant difference between compatible and incompatible interactions in any of the responses tested. These results demonstrate that the molecular biology of the gene-for-gene interaction between wheat and Zymoseptoria is unlike that in many other plant diseases, indicate that environmental conditions may strongly influence early responses of wheat to infection by Z. tritici, and emphasize the importance of including both compatible and incompatible interactions when investigating the biology of this complex pathosystem.",Unrelated and unverifiable

This will fundamentally advance our ability to monitor and control the physical world with applications for consumers, healthcare, the commercial enterprise, security, and for science and engineering in the natural environment. Significantprogress has been made in the development of algorithms and complete systems for scalable, energy-aware networking, sensing, signal processing, and embedded computing. Now, new information technology, microelectronics, and sensor systems are being integrated and deployed in some of the first applications in critical environmental monitoring. This progress, however, reveals a new set of challenges. Specifically, distributed sensor networks have not yet acquired the essential capability to monitor and report their own spatiotemporally-dependent sensing uncertainty. Thus, while sensor networks may acquire information on events in the environment these systems are not yet able to determine the probability that events may be undetected or determine how the combination of calibration error and unknown signal propagation characteristics may degrade the ability to fuse data across a distribution of sensors. For example, in virtually all important application areas, static sensor nodes are confronted with unknown and evolving obstacles to vision or acoustic signal propagation that severely limit the ability to characterize features of interest and introduce uncertainty. Most importantly, self-awareness of sensing uncertainty will be required, for in many applications it is only the sensor network that may be present in an environment and must be depended upon to report its true performance. It is important to note that since it is physical phenomena and evolving environmental structures that induce uncertainty, then physical adaptation of a sensor network (for example, through robotic mobility) may provide the only practical method for detection and reduction of uncertainty. This chapter describes a broad new research thrust, Networked Infomechanical Systems (NIMS), that provides networked nodes exploiting infrastructure- supported mobility for autonomous operations and physical reconfiguration. As shown in Fig. 1, NIMS infrastructure and mobility allow nodes (Figure Presented) to explore complex, full three-dimensional environments. This also enables active reduction of uncertainty through physical reconfiguration of sensing nodes and infrastructures. NIMS adds a unique capability for acquisition and transport of physical samples (for example of water or atmosphere) thereby providing methods for detection and analysis of trace components that are not detectable by conventional in situ sensors. System operating lifetime is extended by NIMS infrastructure that provides energy harvesting (for example of solar energy) and energy distribution. Finally, NIMS mobility and aerial deployment provides networking resources that may be located and oriented to optimize wi eless links for mobile and fixed node systems. The remainder of this chapter begins in Sect. 2 with a description of the challenge problem of sensing uncertainty that inevitably appears in complex environments. The NIMS sensor diversity capability is discussed next with its benefits for reducing sensing uncertainty, enabling adaptive sensor fusion, and extending rate-distortion, bandwidth and energy limits in distributed sensor networks. NIMS applications are also described for natural environmental science and civil (built environment) monitoring. Section 3 introduces sensing diversity and its information theoretic foundations. Sensing diversity reduces sensing uncertainty by exploiting the ability to introduce new sensor systems and to reconfigure sensor networks through robotic mobility. Section 3 then continues with description of the fusion-based detection and localization enabled by NIMS. The development of NIMS introduces essential new tiers in the distributed sensing architecture. These new tiers perm t sensing, sampling, and logistics for transport of nodes, physical samples, energy, and data. The NIMS system hierarchy combines static and mobile sensor nodes, and physically reconfigurable infrastructure that provide sustainable mobility in large, complex three-dimensional spaces. This System Ecology and its attributes are described in Sect. 4 along with the methods of Coordinate Mobility that exploit the System Ecology for self-aware sensing and sampling.

Recent advances in remote sensing and machine learning technologies have contributed to the mapping and monitoring of multi-scale urban land uses, yet there lacks a holistic mapping framework that is compatible with different end users' demands. Moreover, land use mix has evolved to be a key component in modern urban settings, but few have explicitly measured the spatial complexity of land use or quantitively uncovered its driving forces. Addressing these challenges, here we developed a novel two-stage bottom-up scheme for mapping essential urban land use categories. In the first stage, we conducted object-based land use classification using crowdsourcing features derived from multi-source open big data and an automated ensemble learning approach. In the second stage, we identified parcel-based land use attributes, including the dominant type and mixture mode, by spatially correlating land parcels with the object-based results. Furthermore, we investigated the potential influencing factors of land use mix using principal components analysis and multiple linear regression. Experimental results in Ningbo, a coastal city in China, showed that the proposed framework could accurately depict the distribution and composition of urban land uses. At the object scale, the highest classification accuracy was as high as 86% and 78% for the major (Level I) and minor (Level II) categories, respectively. At the parcel scale, the generated land use maps were spatially consistent with the object-based maps. We found larger parcels were more likely to be mixed in land use, and industrial lands were characterized as the most complicated category. We also identified multiple factors that had a collective impact on land use mix, including geography, socioeconomy, accessibility, and landscape metrics. Altogether, our proposed framework offered an alternative to investigating urban land use composition, which could be applied in a broad range of implications in future urban studies.",Misrepresentation

This suggests that afforestation can maintain or even enhance water availability in grasslands, potentially benefiting the native vegetation and water-dependent species.","The world's largest afforestation programs implemented by China made a great contribution to the global ""greening up.""

While mounting evidence shows that afforestation causes substantial reduction in water yield at the watershed scale, process-based studies on how forest plantations alter the partitioning of rainwater and affect water balance components in natural vegetation are still lacking at the plot scale. This lack of science-based data prevents a comprehensive understanding of forest-related ecosystem services such as soil conservation and water supply under climate change. The present study represents the first ""Paired Plot"" study of the water balance of afforestation on the Loess Plateau. We investigate the effects of forest structure and environmental factors on the full water cycle in a typical multilayer plantation forest composed of black locust, one of the most popular tree species for plantations worldwide.

Moreover, there is a strict physiological regulation of forest transpiration. In contrast to grassland, annual seepage under the forest was minor in years with an average rainfall. We conclude that global long-term greening efforts in drylands require careful ecohydrologic evaluation so that green and blue water trade-offs are properly addressed.

Elevated CO₂ levels have been conclusively shown to increase Fusarium biomass and mycotoxin production in wheat tissues, regardless of the specific wheat line .","Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat, caused mainly by a few members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is a major threat to agricultural grain production, food safety, and animal health. The severity of disease epidemics and accumulation of associated trichothecene mycotoxins in wheat kernels is strongly driven by meteorological factors. The potential impacts of change in climate are reviewed from the perspective of the FGSC life cycle and host resistance mechanisms influenced by abiotic pressures at the ecological, physiological and molecular level. Alterations in climate patterns and cropping systems may affect the distribution, composition and load of FGSC inoculum, but quantitative information is lacking regarding the differential responses among FGSC members. In general, the coincidence of wet and warm environment during flowering enhances the risk of FHB epidemics, but the magnitude and direction of the change in FHB and mycotoxin risk will be a consequence of a multitude of effects on key processes affecting inoculum dynamics and host susceptibility. Rates of residue decomposition, inoculum production and dispersal may be significantly altered by changes in crop rotations, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration ([CO<inf>2</inf>]), temperature and precipitation patterns, but the impact may be much greater for regions where inoculum is more limited, such as temperate climates. In regions of non-limiting inoculum, climate change effects will likely be greater on the pathogenic rather than on the saprophytic phase. Although the mechanisms by which abiotic stress influences wheat defences against Fusarium species are unknown, available data would suggest that wheat may be more susceptible to Fusarium infection under future climate conditions. Additional research in this area should be a priority so that breeding efforts and climate resilient management strategies can be developed.
[2]: This study examines the CO<inf>2</inf>-mediated influence of plant resistance on crown rot dynamics under continuous cropping of partially resistant wheat line 249 and the susceptible cultivar Tamaroi.

Monoconidial isolates from wheat stubble were collected initially, and after five cropping cycles, to compare the frequency and aggressiveness of Fusarium species in the two populations. Aggressiveness was measured using a high-throughput seedling bioassay. At elevated CO<inf>2</inf>, the higher initial incidence in Tamaroi increased with cropping cycles, but incidence in 249 remained unchanged. Incidence at ambient CO<inf>2</inf> did not change for either line. Elevated CO<inf>2</inf> induced partial resistance in Tamaroi, but not in 249. Increased Fusarium biomass in wheat tissue at elevated CO<inf>2</inf> matched raised deoxynivalenol of the stem base in both lines. After five cycles of continuous wheat cropping, aggressiveness increased in pathogenic F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum by 110%, but decreased in weakly pathogenic F. equiseti and F. oxysporum by 50%. CO<inf>2</inf> and host resistance interactively influenced species frequency, and the highly aggressive F. pseudograminearum became dominant on Tamaroi irrespective of CO<inf>2</inf> concentration, while its frequency declined on 249.

[4]: Background: Coffee is one of the most consumed beverages worldwide. In the last years, coffee consumption has been associated with a number of beneficial effects against metabolic impairment. The aim of this narrative review was to report the most updated and comprehensive evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies as well as mechanisms of action of coffee on metabolic impairment. Methods: A search in electronic databases (PUBMED and EMBASE) was performed to retrieve systematic and pooled analyses on coffee and diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Furthermore, the most accredited hypotheses and mechanisms of action of coffee have been described. Results: Coffee consumption has been associated with reduced risk of diabetes in observational studies. However, the effect seems not to be mediated by caffeine. Contrasting results have been found in pooled analyses of observational studies on hypertension, despite short- and long-term follow-ups that have been demonstrated to influence the outcome. Poor or little effect on plasma lipids has been reported in studies on acute administration of coffee, yet depending on the type of coffee preparation. The main beneficial effects of coffee consumption seem to rely on the content of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds (i.e., polyphenols). Among the most important, chlorogenic acids have demonstrated direct anti-hypertensive action through beneficial effect on endothelial function, and significant improvement in glucose and insulin metabolism. Also, diterpenes and melanoidins are major candidates as antioxidant compounds showing the capacity to inhibit the production of inflammatory mediators. However, caffeine and diterpenes may also exert negative effects, such as acute rise in blood pressure and serum lipids. Conclusion: In light of the most recent evidence, coffee consumption seems to be favorably related with health and to protect by metabolic impairment.",Misrepresentation
i_1824,Contradiction,"Socioeconomic Factors: Maternal education, household cleanliness, and socioeconomic status have little to no impact on stunting rates. Poor maternal education and inadequate household conditions do not exacerbate stunting .","Poor linear growth in children <5 years old, or stunting, is a serious public health problem particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a conceptual framework on the Context, Causes and Consequences of Childhood Stunting (the 'WHO framework') that identifies specific and general factors associated with stunting. The framework is based upon a global review of data, and we have applied it to a country-level analysis where health and nutrition policies are made and public health and nutrition data are collected. We reviewed the literature related to sub-optimal linear growth, stunting and birth outcomes in Ethiopia as a case study. We found consistent associations between poor linear growth and indicators of birth size, recent illness (e.g. diarrhoea and fever), maternal height and education. Other factors listed as causes in the framework such as inflammation, exposure to mycotoxins and inadequate feeding during and after illness have not been examined in Ethiopia, and the existing literature suggests that these are clear data gaps. Some factors associated with poor linear growth in Ethiopia are missing in the framework, such as household characteristics (e.g. exposure to indoor smoke). Examination of the factors included in the WHO framework in a country setting helps identifying data gaps helping to target further data collection and research efforts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.
[5]: Objective To estimate the determinants of stunting using rich data from a birth cohort study from urban South Africa and to examine the various mechanisms, both proximate and distal, through which maternal education affects stunting. Design Multivariate regression analysis using birth cohort data, where the outcome variable was stunting at age 2 years, and multiple mediator analysis to identify pathways from maternal education to stunting. Setting South Africa's largest metropolitan area, Soweto-Johannesburg. Subjects Participants of Birth to Twenty Plus, a longitudinal cohort study of children born in 1990 (n 691). Results In multivariate analysis, the birth weight Z-score (-0·084; P<0·001; 95 % CI-0·11,-0·06), the mother's openness towards modern health care, captured by a vaccination score (-0·05; P=0·04; 95 % CI-0·10,-0·00), and a better-quality care environment (-0·015; P=0·04; 95 % CI-0·03,-0·00) were found to be negatively associated with stunting. Having experienced symptoms of illness related to ears and eyes increased the risk of stunting (0·038; P=0·01; 95 % CI 0·01, 0·07). Results of the mediation analysis showed that maternal education had an indirect effect on stunting largely through socio-economic status and the antenatal environment (measured by the birth weight Z-score). Conclusions Overall, many of the factors that were protective against stunting in the final analysis, whether they operated through maternal education or not, were related to the mother's contribution to the child's life. This reinforces the idea that to minimise stunting, enhanced antenatal and postnatal services to better support and empower mothers may be important.
[6]: Background: This study examines how significant is the changes in child stunting in Sub-Saharan African countries (SSA). Then, it investigates factors that contributed to the reduction in child stunting in those countries. For each country, we distinguish the contribution of compositional effects and structural effect. Methods: This paper uses data from Demographic and Health Surveys of 12 sub-Saharan African countries conducted between 2000 and 2020. The z-test to compare two independent proportions was used to assess changes in child stunting and explanatory variables over the period. Recentred influence function (RIF) decomposition method was used to decompose changes in stunting over the year in each country, and to determine the contribution of each variable to the changes. Results: The prevalence of child stunting declines significantly in 11 countries over the year. The decline varies from 6.8% in Cameroun to 19% in Mali. The average year of education of the child's mother and father, and the proportion of households with access to an improved drinking water source have contributed to the reduction in child stunting. This result was found in all the countries. Improvements in living standards, child vaccination, antenatal care attendance, delivery to health care centres, maternal education, improved drinking water sources, and improved sanitation make the largest contribution to the composition component, hence reducing child stunting. Conclusions: This study sheds light on what has contributed to the achieved improvement in child nutritional status and suggests how to possibly accelerate the reduction in undernutrition in countries that lag.",Opposite meaning

Likewise, various research initiatives have advocated recycling of construction and demolition wastes and novel technologies to avert their generation. Owing to disadvantages of steel rebar, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) was utilized as potential internal reinforcement in recycled concrete beam owing to its lightweight, non-corrosiveness, high-stiffness-to-weight ratio and flexibility. Our study revealed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and efficiency which is controlled by the fibre architecture. The improved mechanical properties was attributed to the Bauschinger strain-reversal effect, made possible by the effective CFRP tensile strength mobilization, its high bonded surface area and interfacial energy as well as the composite action of the multi-layered CFRP reinforcements. The best configuration (N4) revealed by the simplified linear weighted sum optimization method achieved strengthening (load) efficiency of 402.7%, ductility efficiency of 299.7%, fracture toughness efficiency of 567.1% and fracture energy efficiency of 5713.9% compared to the unreinforced control. In addition, CFRP laminate was 3.67–4.9 times more cost-effective than steel rebar in terms of fracture toughness. Therefore, CFRP-reinforced recycled concrete is recommended for cost-effective and sustainable prefabricated concrete structures.
[11]: Advanced fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) systems have been widely used for the structural strengthening and rehabilitation of existing buildings and bridges for decades. Such as the engineering community has accepted these systems as viable, long-term strengthening solutions for structural bridge and building elements, so too have they accepted them for the rehabilitation and strengthening of pipelines. This relatively novel FRP technology is extremely conducive to application in pipeline rehabilitation and strengthening; its unidirectional strength properties and malleable form make precision design and installation of the system efficient and cost-effective in many applications. As the design of FRP pipeline strengthening systems becomes more refined, so too must the inspection methods used to assure these systems' proper installation and post-installation performance. Various experiences have been compiled from nuclear, industrial, and municipal installations on steel, reinforced concrete, and pre-stressed concrete cylinder piping. Resulting conclusions and best-practices on processes ranging from monitoring of in-field environmental conditions, to critical points of structural observation during installation, and proper methods of post-cure imperfection detection and remediation will be defined and presented within this paper. The aim of this work will be to inform end-users and installers alike of necessary inspection and observation steps required during installations to ensure the safe and proper performance of FRP pipeline strengthening systems.",Missing information

While microplastics and nanoplastics are concerning, their impact on aquatic organisms is often overstated, as some studies suggest that their effects may not be as severe as previously thought, potentially leading to misconceptions about the urgency of the issue .","Plastic pollution is a planetary threat, affecting nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem globally. In response, multilevel mitigation strategies are being adopted but with a lack of quantitative assessment of how such strategies reduce plastic emissions. We assessed the impact of three broad management strategies, plastic waste reduction, waste management, and environmental recovery, at different levels of effort to estimate plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries. We estimate that 19 to 23 million metric tons, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems. Considering the ambitious commitments currently set by governments, annual emissions may reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030. To reduce emissions to a level well below this prediction, extraordinary efforts to transform the global plastics economy are needed.
[2]: Contamination by bulk plastics and plastic debris is currently the one of the most serious environmental problems in aquatic ecosystems. In particular, small-scale plastic debris such as microplastics and nanoplastics has become leading contributors to the pollution of marine and freshwater ecosystems. Studies are investigating the impacts of micro-and nanoplastics on aquatic organisms and ecosystems worldwide. This review covers 83 studies that investigated the distribution of microplastics and the ecotoxicity of micro- and nanoplastics in marine and freshwater ecosystems. The studies indicated that micro-sized plastics and plastic debris were distributed at various concentrations in aquatic ecosystems around the world. They had various effects on the growth, development, behavior, reproduction, and mortality of aquatic animals. We discuss these studies in detail and suggest directions for future research.
[3]: The dependence on plastic materials for modern life has led to an increase of plastic waste in coastal systems. Microplastics (plastics < 5. mm in size) in particular, have induced alarm among scientific and management bodies as an emerging marine and coastal contaminant. Recent studies suggest that these small plastic particles are ubiquitous in the marine system, as they have been recorded in every coastal and marine habitat around the world. The presence of microplastics in the environment has been shown to have negative consequences for many marine wildlife species, such as marine birds, turtles, and fish. To mitigate the harm caused by plastic pollution, it is essential to understand the life cycle of plastic products, beginning with plastic use and disposal, to the arrival at coastal marine environments. Therefore, this chapter focuses on the issue of plastic pollution in the coastal environment and reviews the current knowledge base on sources, dispersal, accumulation, and most importantly solutions for the problem of plastic pollution. This chapter also discusses and gives examples of current initiatives to reduce the plastic load, including the circular economy approach, and other successful campaigns around the world.

To address this challenge, we hypothesized that molecular diversity is not only related to species diversity, but also constrained by trophic, climatic, and topographical factors. We screened the metabolome of 416 vascular plant species encompassing the entire alpine elevation range and four alpine bioclimatic regions in order to characterize their phytochemical diversity. We show that by coupling phylogenetic information, topographic, edaphic, and climatic variables, we predict phytochemical diversity, and its inherent composition, of plant communities throughout landscape. Spatial mapping of phytochemical diversity further revealed that plant assemblages found in low to midelevation habitats, with more alkaline soils, possessed greater phytochemical diversity, whereas alpine habitats possessed higher phytochemical endemism. Altogether, we present a general tool that can be used for predicting hotspots of phytochemical diversity in the landscape, independently of plant species taxonomic identity.

The study is carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine with a compression ratio of 16.7. By varying the common rail pressure, the effect of injection pressure on combustion and emissions is investigated.The results illustrate that the combustion delay of the gasoline-type fuels is extended with the increase of injection pressure. The soot emission decreases at high injection pressure with a penalty of higher CO and HC emissions. Increasing the injection pressure also reduces the particle number in accumulation mode, but produces more in nucleation mode. Among the test fuels, naphtha has the lowest NO<inf>x</inf> emission due to low combustion temperature but the highest CO and HC emissions. There is no significant difference in particle size distribution for the three fuels. The indicated thermal efficiency of gasoline-type fuels increases with the rise of injection pressure and is higher than that of diesel at high injection pressure.

However, actual empirical research works in this research area are limited. This paper reports the first stage of a research study, which aims to identify and assess the principal risks for the delivery of PPP projects in China and to address their proper risk allocation between the private and public sectors. An empirical questionnaire survey was designed to examine the relative importance of different risk factors and to analyze the allocation of risk factors to different parties in PPP projects. A total of 580 questionnaires were sent out, and a total of 105 valid responses were obtained for data analysis. The Mann-Whitney U test is employed to investigate whether significant difference in perception existed first between the private and public sectors and second between industrial practitioners and academics in China. The empirical findings show that the three most important risk factors for PPP projects in China are (1)government intervention; (2)government corruption; and (3)poor public decision-making processes. These findings reveal that the Chinese government intervention and corruption may be the major obstacles to the success of PPP projects in China. A major cause for these risks may be attributed to inefficient legislative and supervisory systems for PPP projects in China. After conducting the Mann-Whitney U test on the 105 survey respondents, the empirical findings indicate that the perceptions of all 34 risk factors in China between the private and public sectors were not significantly different. Similarly, there were no significant differences between academics and industrial practitioners except that the former perceived the problem of government corruption to be more severe than did the latter. For risk allocation, the empirical results indicate that the public and private sectors were in general consensus with most of the risks identified. The major risks that the public sector preferred to accept are within the systematic risk category, especially political, legal, and social risks. The private sector preferred to retain the principal risks within the specific project risk category, especially construction, operation, and relationship risks, in addition to economic risks within systematic risk category.

These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response. Such reactions have been uncoupled from PHT1 activity, suggesting that systemic Pi sensing is most probably acting downstream of PHT1.",Entity error

Hence, there is a need to assess and quantify environmental services as well as environmental impacts, so that these can be included in the decision making process. At the same time, recent trends in optimisation software and Internet technology have spawned a new research area in the field of distributed optimisation applications for several domains, including environmental management. © Dynamic Publishers, Inc.",Missing information
i_1374,Contradiction,"Molecular Subgroups: Recent advancements have identified five distinct molecular subgroups of MB: WNT, SHH (Sonic Hedgehog), Group 3, Group 4, and Group 5 .","Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric brain tumor and a primary cause of cancer-related death in children. Until a few years ago, only clinical and histological features were exploited for MB pathological classification and outcome prognosis. In the past decade, the advancement of high-throughput molecular analyses that integrate genetic, epigenetic, and expression data, together with the availability of increasing wealth of patient samples, revealed the existence of four molecularly distinct MB subgroups. Their further classification into 12 subtypes not only reduced the well-characterized intertumoral heterogeneity, but also provided new opportunities for the design of targets for precision oncology. Moreover, the identification of tumorigenic and self-renewing subpopulations of cancer stem cells in MB has increased our knowledge of its biology. Despite these advancements, the origin of MB is still debated, and its molecular bases are poorly characterized. A major goal in the field is to identify the key genes that drive tumor growth and the mechanisms through which they are able to promote tumorigenesis. So far, only protein-coding genes acting as oncogenic drivers have been characterized in each MB subgroup. The contribution of the non-coding side of the genome, which produces a plethora of transcripts that control fundamental biological processes, as the cell choice between proliferation and differentiation, is still unappreciated. This review wants to fill this major gap by summarizing the recent findings on the impact of non-coding RNAs in MB initiation and progression. Furthermore, their potential role as specific MB biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets is also highlighted.
[3]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Currently, »one-size-fits-all» radiation and chemotherapy treatment regimen is employed for treating MB patient, causing at least some children to undergo highly aggressive and in some cases, inadequate radiation therapy. Consequently, there is a need for prognostic and predictive tools for identifying disease aggressiveness and ultimately which patients with MB may be able to benefit from de-escalation of therapy. Genomic characterization of MB has recently identified 4 distinct molecular subgroups: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Wingless (WNT), Group 3, Group 4 each exhibiting different clinical behavior. The molecular sub-types have unique risk-profiles and outcomes, and patients could potentially benefit from sub-group specific treatments. However, the transition of these molecular MB subtypes into clinical practice has been limited due to challenges in availability of molecular profiling in most hospitals, as well as variability in clinical assessment. In this work, we present a radiomic feature that captures subtle tissue deformations caused due to the impact of tumor growth on the normal-appearing brain around tumor (BAT), to distinguish molecular sub-types of MB. First, we obtain voxel-wise deformation magnitude from the deformation orientations, after registering Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-w MRI scan for every study to a normal age-specific T1w MRI template. Deformation statistics are then computed within every 5mm annular BAT region, 0 < d < 60mm, where d is the distance from the tumor infiltrating edge, to capture subtle localized deformation changes around the tumor. Our results using multi-class comparison via one-way ANOVA and post-hoc comparison showed significant differences across deformation magnitudes obtained for Group 3, Group 4, and SHH molecular sub-types, observed up to 15-mm outside the infiltrating edge. Our feasibility results suggest that the subtle deformation features in BAT observed on routine Gd-T1w MRI may potentially serve as surrogate markers to non-invasively characterize molecular sub-types of pediatric MB.
[4]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although multimodality treatment regimens including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have greatly improved disease outcome, about one-third of MB patient remains incurable, and many long-term survivors are suffered from deleterious effects due to aggressive treatment. Understanding the signaling pathways and the genetic mechanisms contributed to MB development would be the key to develop novel therapeutic treatment strategies for improving survival and outcome of MB. In this review, we discuss the biological signaling pathways involved in MB pathogenesis. We also go through the current international consensus of four core MB subgroups namely, SHH, WNT, Group 3, and Group 4. This is adopted based on the knowledge of genomic complexity of MB as analyzed by recent high-throughput genomic technology. We talk about immunohistochemistry assays established to determine molecular subgroup affiliation. In the last part of review, we discuss how identification of molecular subgroups is going to change our routine disease diagnosis and clinical management.
[6]: Purpose of review: Most children diagnosed with cancer today are expected to be cured. Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, is an example of a disease that has benefitted from advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy over the past decades. It was an incurable disease 50 years ago, but approximately 70% of children with medulloblastoma are now cured of their disease. However, the pace of increasing the cure rate has slowed over the past 2 decades, and we have likely reached the maximal benefit that can be achieved with cytotoxic therapy and clinical risk stratification. Long-term toxicity of therapy also remains significant. To increase cure rates and decrease long-term toxicity, there is great interest in incorporating biologic 'targeted' therapy into treatment of medulloblastoma, but this will require a paradigm shift in how we classify and study disease. Recent findings: Using genome-based high-throughput analytic techniques, several groups have independently reported methods of molecular classification of medulloblastoma within the past year. This has resulted in a working consensus to view medulloblastoma as four molecular subtypes, including wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT) pathway subtype, Sonic Hedgehog pathway subtype and two less well defined subtypes (groups C and D). Summary: Novel classification and risk stratification based on biologic subtypes of disease will form the basis of further study in medulloblastoma and identify specific subtypes that warrant greater research focus. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
[7]: Medulloblastoma is an aggressive primitive neuroectodermal tumor of the cerebellum that is more common in children than in adults. In the past decade, advances in understanding the molecular drivers of medulloblastoma have identified four molecular subgroups defined by experimental gene expression profiles: the WNT pathway, sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway, and subgroups 3 and 4 (non-SHH/WNT).  Medulloblastoma of adults belong primarily to the SHH category. Vismodegib, an SHH-pathway inhibitor, FDA-approved in 2012 for treatment of basal cell carcinoma, has been used successfully in the setting of chemorefractory medulloblastoma, but not as a first-line therapy. In 2016, we reported a case of an adult patient with a sustained response of an unresectable multifocal form of adult medulloblastoma to vismodegib. Molecular analysis in that case revealed mutations in TP53 and a cytogenetic abnormality, i17q, that is prevalent and most often associated with subgroup 4 rather than the SHH-activated form of medulloblastoma. Here, we report further whole-genome analysis of that patient (designated Patient A) as well as an additional adult patient (Patient B) whose tumor harbored the SHH molecular subgroup but which was unresponsive to visgmodegib therapy. Comparison of these disparate responses highlights the challenges to tailoring SHH-targeted treatment in individual patients with adult medulloblastoma.",Numeric error

Weekly resolved remotely sensed sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy data were used for the year 2004. Fifteen generalized additive models were constructed with skipjack catch per unit effort as a response variable, and sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy as model covariates to assess the effect of environment on catch per unit effort (skipjack tuna abundance). Model selection was based on significance of model terms, reduction in Akaike's Information Criterion, and increase in cumulative deviance explained. The model selected was used to predict skipjack tuna catch per unit effort using monthly resolved environmental data for assessing model performance and to visualize the basin scale distribution of skipjack tuna habitat. Predicted values were validated using a linear model. Based on the four-parameter model, skipjack tuna habitat selection was significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by sea surface temperatures ranging from 20.5 to 26°C, relatively oligotrophic waters (surface chlorophyll 0.08-0.18, 0.22-0.27 and 0.3-0.37 mg m<sup>-3</sup>), zero to positive anomalies (surface height anomalies 0-50 cm), and low to moderate eddy kinetic energy (0-200 and 700-2500 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>). Predicted catch per unit effort showed a trend consistent with the north-south migration of skipjack tuna. Validation of predicted catch per unit effort with that observed, pooled monthly, was significant (P < 0.01, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.64).

PPO is a policy gradient method that aims to improve the stability and reliability of policy updates by ensuring that the new policy does not deviate too much from the old policy. This is achieved through a clipped objective function that penalizes large changes .,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged recently as a powerful way of dealing with non-Euclidean data on graphs, such as social networks and citation networks. Despite their success, obtaining optimal graph neural networks requires immense manual work and domain knowledge. Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search in CNN, a few attempts automatically search optimal GNNs that rival the best human-invented architectures. However, existing Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) approaches face two challenges: (1) Sampling GNNs across the entire search space results in low search efficiency, particularly in large search spaces. (2) It is pretty costly to evaluate GNNs by training architectures from scratch. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an Efficient Graph Neural Architecture Search (EGNAS) method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a prediction network. Specifically, EGNAS first uses MCTS to recursively partition the entire search space into good or bad search regions. Then, the reinforcement learning-based search strategy (also called the agent) is applied to sample GNNs in those good search regions, which prevents overly exploring complex architectures and bad-performance regions, thus improving sampling efficiency. To reduce the evaluation cost, we use a prediction network to estimate the performance of GNNs. We alternately use ground-truth accuracy (by training GNNs from scratch) and prediction accuracy (by the prediction network) to update the search strategy to avoid inaccuracies caused by long-term use of the prediction network. Furthermore, to improve the training efficiency and stability, the agent is trained by a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that EGNAS can search for better GNNs in the promising search region in a shorter search time, with an accuracy of 83.5%, 73.3%, 79.6%, and 94.5% on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Photo datasets, respectively In particular, compared to the most popular GNAS algorithm, our EGNAS-NP without using the prediction network achieves an accuracy of 83.6% on Cora, 73.5% on Citeseer, 79.9% on Pubmed, and 94.6% on Photo, with a relative improvement of 0.6%, 0.2%, 0.7%, and 0.6%.",Missing information

Yet it would be impossible to find a way in the aperture made possible by this new phenomenological practice if some returns weren't operated towards the first places where phenomenology was born. This paper aims to underline some crossings between the phenomenology of Henri Maldiney and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl in order to think over about the task of the phenomenological description. Following Maldiney's example, the construction of a method which occupied Husserl's main work must be completed by its transformations, to be discovered in its application.
[7]: In this article, I argue that Husserl received important cues from Natorp and his project of a transcendental psychology. I also trace the entire relationship both thinkers had over the course of their lifetime and show how there were important cross-fertilizations on both sides. In particular, Natorp's project of a reconstructive psychology proved crucial, I argue, for Husserl's development of genetic phenomenology. Allowing for a reconstruction of subjectiveintentional processes makes Husserl see the possibility of breaking with the paradigm of direct intuition as the sole method of phenomenology. However, Natorp's psychology was also seriously flawed, to Husserl. While exploiting the fruitful elements of Natorp's reconstructive psychology, Husserl maintained that they could only come to actual fruition in a transcendental phenomenology.
[8]: This article focuses on Max Horkheimer's criticism of Husserl's phenomenology in basic philosophical matters such as method, theory, logic, truth, metaphysics, etc. Horkheimer objects to Husserl's conception of philosophy as a mathesis universalis and of science as relativistic research. However, he finds Husserl's criticism of scientific rationalism the most important step for the legitimacy of philosophy. According to him, Husserl's method is intended to be a science of apriority. But his understanding of apriority is static, is radically abstract, and overlooks the dialectical relation. Therefore, his method is ahistorical and undialectical. Horkheimer does not interpret Husserl's idealism in the sense of classical idealism. However, he believes that the positivistic and Cartesian implications in Husserl's philosophy made his method less fruitful in concrete situations. Consequently, he calls Husserl's phenomenology abstract positivism, traditional theory and a bourgeois ideology. Horkheimer's critique focuses on Husserl's early period of phenomenology. © The Author(s) 2013.",Unrelated and unverifiable

By 2050, according to Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates, around 70% more production of agricultural products will be needed to fulfil the demands of the world population. Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of ""zero hunger"", potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study.

A commercial diesel fuel is also tested in conventional diesel combustion mode and double injection mode as a comparison. The study is carried out in a single cylinder diesel engine with a compression ratio of 16.7. By varying the common rail pressure, the effect of injection pressure on combustion and emissions is investigated.The results illustrate that the combustion delay of the gasoline-type fuels is extended with the increase of injection pressure. The soot emission decreases at high injection pressure with a penalty of higher CO and HC emissions. Increasing the injection pressure also reduces the particle number in accumulation mode, but produces more in nucleation mode. Among the test fuels, naphtha has the lowest NO<inf>x</inf> emission due to low combustion temperature but the highest CO and HC emissions. There is no significant difference in particle size distribution for the three fuels. The indicated thermal efficiency of gasoline-type fuels increases with the rise of injection pressure and is higher than that of diesel at high injection pressure. Naphtha has the highest efficiency as a result of its low heat transfer and exhaust loss.The diesel fuel has lower CO and HC emissions than the gasoline-type fuels do, but much higher pressure rise rate, NO<inf>x</inf> and soot emissions due to high combustion temperature and poor premixing.

Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around long-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming. Shifting temperatures are climbing and sea levels are rising. And meanwhile, our planet must still supply us and all living things with air, water, food and safe places to live. If we don't act now, climate change will rapidly alter the lands and waters we all depend upon for survival, leaving our children and grandchildren with a very different world. The most important task of all countries in the face of climate change is to make efforts to reduce climate change and spend more time to anticipate and prevent its risks. The efforts and actions can be done in the current situation are including natural resource conservation, development of green spaces, reduction of power consumption of fossil fuels, saving in consumption, recycling and reduction of waste, sewage treatment, use of renewable energy sources and implementation of appropriate educational programs. The remarkable thing is that these actions by the government alone cannot be done and, thus, all persons in any country should play their role. This requires environmental education in the field of climate change for people to deal with these issues correctly. Thus, in last decade in various countries, study has been done in the field of education to climate change. But reviews of these studies, particularly in Iran, shows that adequate studies have not yet been done to educate climate change in the educational system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of the climate change education plan in the formal education system. Materials and methods: Iran formal education system: educational system of Iran is comprised of three sections. These three sections include formal, informal and implicit. In this study, the third grade of the first period of high school is considered as a case study to develop a climate change education plan. Education in the educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard is in four steps; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation. In the Figure (1), the educational process management is represented according to ISO 10015 standard. (Figure Presented) Results and discussion: As mentioned above in this study, climate change education plan for third grade of the first period of high school is developed based on educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard. Education in this system in four steps includes; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation of results. Needs assessment The results show that, the most important educational needs, which are obtained with Fish Bowl technique, as follows are; introduction of basic concepts, current state of climate, climate change causes, effects and impacts, solutions and strategies for prevention, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Table 1). (Table Presented) Educational designing and planning Educational designing and planning was done in the five steps, which the goals are: Development thinking about the climate change, increase in student knowledge in this field, training of appropriate personnel to manage climate change. (Table Presented) In the implementation of education, teacher is operator training and the Ministry of Education is in the form of Education Office and schools can support teachers in monitoring the implementation. In the evaluation step, the teacher in addition to the evaluation of classroom sessions should do a final evaluation. Thus, the evaluation should be a combination of formative and final assessment, which recommended the use of goal oriented Tyler pattern. Conclusion: Accurate knowledge about the effects of climate change is essential as a key factor for conscious action and the formation of a person's determination to deal with the effects of climate change. Studies from around the world have observed an unfortunate chain of students not being given an adequate and accurate education on climate change, of teachers not knowing how or what to teach, and of the public that is misinformed about these issues. The structure proposed in this study to climate change education determined the contents that require students to do need assessments. This is based on educational designing and planning. Therefore, the teachers with use of educational designing and planning and on the job training increase their knowledge in this field and it will teach the students. [10] Human-induced climate change is the largest threat to our continued existence on beautiful planet Earth. It is currently framed as ""global warming,"" ""climate disruption,"" ""climate chaos,"" and ""the climate emergency"" in attempts to draw attention to our dire situation and the need for immediate and dramatic action. As ever more frightening scientific evidence of the likely extent and speed of climate change's impacts becomes readily accessible, it seems that the extent of our collective denial increases. It is as if we are ""caught in the headlights"" of an oncoming vehicle, unable to act towards personal and planetary survival. This paper draws upon Gaian science, deep ecology, the ""work that reconnects,"" and the power of story to explore how we might reframe climate change so we can engage with, and respond to, it productively. It asks ""What if ⋯ instead of being a 'Threat' to us and our world, we consider climate change as an 'Ally' of 'The Great Turning' of humankind towards a more sustainable way of living and being?"" In doing so, we might feel more at ease amidst forthcoming catastrophic weather events and other dramatic changes; feel supported in our efforts to transform our own lives and communities from ""Business as Usual""; become more motivated to act for wider systemic change; and even discover new meaning, purpose, and joy at being alive at this moment in time.

EDDS revealed a higher toxicity to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in comparison to EDTA, but no toxicity to microorganisms.

Both chelating agents showed a very low root to shoot translocation capability and the translocation factor was lower than the one of the control. Heavy metals where significantly more phytoavailable than in the control, even after harvesting, resulting in a high heavy metal leaching possibility, probably owing to a low biodegradation rate of EDDS. New seedlings which were transplanted into the EDDS treated pots 7 d after the phytoextraction experiment, showed signs of necrosis and chlorosis, which resulted in a significantly lower biomass in comparison to the control. The seedlings on the EDTA treated pots showed no toxicity signs.

Aims: The aims of the study are to(a) estimate height differences between schoolchildren of three major local STs, (b) compare heights and average skinfold thickness (SFT) of ST with non-ST and urban schoolchildren, and (c) compare median heights and weights of ST and non-ST schoolchildren with the Indian Academy of Pediatrics standards. Settings and Design: Four Ashram schools and one urban school in Northwest Maharashtra. Subjects and Methods: All children from age 6 to 17 years were included for height, weight, and mid-arm circumference (n = 2106). Data were processed with Excel and Epi info software for quantitative comparisons. Statistical Analysis Used: Quantitative methods including ANOVA were used for statistical comparison of heights. Results: There were no differences among heights between ST students (ANOVA P > 0.05). However, there were significant differences between heights of boys and girls between ST and non-ST students across age groups (ANOVA P < 0.0001). ST boys and girls were mostly below 3<sup>rd</sup> or 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of IAP height and weight charts while non-ST children were between 25<sup>th</sup> and 50<sup>th</sup> percentiles.

In addition, the monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) of carbon dioxide emissions is necessary for the success of international agreements to reduce emissions. However, existing fossil-fuel carbon dioxide (FFCO<inf>2</inf>) emissions inventories vary in terms of the data and methods used to estimate and distribute FFCO<inf>2</inf>. This paper compares how the approaches used to create spatially explicit FFCO<inf>2</inf> emissions inventories affect the spatial distribution of emissions estimates and the magnitude of emissions estimates in specific locales. Five spatially explicit FFCO<inf>2</inf> emission inventories were compared: Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center (CDIAC), Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf> (ODIAC), and Vulcan. The effects of using specific data and approaches in the creation of spatially explicit FFCO<inf>2</inf> emissions inventories, and the effect of resolution on data representation are analyzed using graphical, numerical, and cartographic approaches. We examined the effect of using top-down versus bottom-up approaches, nightlights versus population proxies, and the inclusion of large point sources. The results indicate that the approach used to distribute emissions in space creates distinct patterns in the distribution of emissions estimates and hence in the estimates of emissions in specific locations. The different datasets serve different purposes but collectively show the key role of large point sources and urban centers and the strong relationship between scale and uncertainty.",Unrelated and unverifiable

Surface Densification: Optimal Conditions: A compressing temperature of 150 to 160 °C and a closing speed of 10 mm/min are recommended to achieve higher surface hardness without deforming the wood .,"Poplar (Populus tomentosa Carr.) solid wood was surface densified in the tangential direction, and the vertical density profile (VDP) and hardness of the treated and untreated samples were measured. The effects of the process parameters on the VDP and hardness were investigated. To explicitly describe the VDP of the surface densified wood, five indices (AD, ADx, PD, PDi, and DTh) were used. The compressing temperature and closing speed influenced the formation and shape of the VDP. A higher temperature yielded a greater PD and Pdi, and a faster closing speed yielded a higher PD, but smaller PDi and DTh. Increasing the compression ratio increased the AD, ADx, and maximum load, and the poplar wood was compressed in the overall thickness as the compression ratio exceeded a certain degree. The Janka hardness of the poplar wood was significantly improved after surface densification; a higher temperature resulting in a higher surface hardness was explained by the higher PD. The closing speed and compression ratio affected the hardness by impacting the VDP, specifically the PD and DTh indices. When the PD and DTh were greater the surface hardness was greater. By this study, a compressing temperature of 140 to 160 °C and the closing speed of 10 mm/min is recommended, and to prevent the deformation of unheated side of the wood samples and obtain a higher surface hardness, the compression ratio is restricted to 20%.",Numeric error

In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchainbased application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election.

Removal of cyanobacterial toxins from drinking water is important to avoid serious illness in consumers. This objective can be confidently achieved through the application of the multiple barrier approach to drinking water quality and safety. In this study the use of a multiple barrier approach incorporating coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the removal of intracellular and extracellular cyanobacterial toxins from two naturally occurring blooms in South Australia. Also investigated was the impact of these treatments on the UF flux. In this multibarrier approach, coagulation was used to remove the cells and thus the intracellular toxin while PAC was used for extracellular toxin adsorption and finally the UF was used for floc, PAC and cell removal. Cyanobacterial cells were completely removed using the UF membrane alone and when used in conjunction with coagulation. Extracellular toxins were removed to varying degrees by PAC addition. UF flux deteriorated dramatically during a trial with a very high cell concentration; however, the flux was improved by coagulation and PAC addition. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. [18] Water has been called the berth of life as it performs basic ecological functions in every environment. Many relevant water properties are not discernible to the human senses: microbes are invisible; colour and taste often give little indication of water composition or potability. For this reason, technological deficiencies in water management are often responsible for disease, mortality and poverty in low-income societies. In developed countries, there is mounting evidence of the secondary effects of medicines, household products and chemicals present in sewage. Diffuse contamination caused by agriculture and livestock production can reach rivers and lead to water eutrophication favouring algae and microbe blooms. Both the nature of the problems and the availability of technology vary regionally but improper water management places important limitations on the wellbeing of local populations, women in particular. A moral issue stands out: the commitment to the amelioration of the population's water health, safety and resource use, while taking into account the sensibilities of local cultures.

Researchers thoroughly analyzed SDN vulnerabilities and improved its security. However, we believe important security aspects of SDN are still left uninvestigated. In this paper, we raise the concern of the possibility for an attacker to obtain detailed knowledge about an SDN network. In particular, we introduce a novel attack, named Know Your Enemy (KYE),bymeansof which an attacker can gather vital information about the configuration of the network. This information ranges from the configuration of security tools, such as attack detection thresholds for network scanning, to general network policies like QoS and network virtualization. Additionally, we show that an attacker can perform a KYE attack in a stealthy fashion, i.e., without the risk of being detected. We underline that the vulnerability exploited by the KYE attack is proper of SDN and is not present in legacy networks.
[6]: Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has emerged as a framework for centralized command and control in cloud data centric environments. SDN separates data and control plane, which provides network administrator better visibility and policy enforcement capability compared to traditional networks. The SDN controller can assess reachability infor- mation of all the hosts in a network. There are many critical assets in a network which can be compromised by a malicious attacker through a multistage attack. Thus we make use of centralized controller to assess the security state of the entire network and pro-actively perform attack analysis and coun- termeasure selection. This approach is also known as Mov- ing Target Defense (MTD). We use the SDN controller to assess the attack scenarios through scalable Attack Graphs (AG) and select necessary countermeasures to perform net- work reconfiguration to counter network attacks. Moreover, our framework has a comprehensive con ict detection and resolution module that ensures that no two ow rules in a distributed SDN-based cloud environment have conflicts at any layer; thereby assuring consistent conflict-free policy implementation and preventing information leakage.",Missing information

s_1770,Contradiction,"Disadvantages: High-cost, slow, insensitive, and non-selective analysis .","Background: Food safety is becoming increasingly important because food industry must provide quality products to minimize the health risks. Traditional methods to assure food safety, such as plate count and polymerase chain reaction are accurate and robust but can hardly satisfy the needs of the food industry because they are costly and time consuming. Therefore, optical biosensors that can analyze food in a low-cost, facile, fast, sensitive, and selective manner started to emerge. Scope and approach: This review presents plasmonic biosensors including surface plasmon resonance (SPR), localized SPR (LSPR), fiber optic SPR (FO-SPR), surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), surface-enhanced fluorescence (SEF), and total internal reflection (TIR) based sensors and their applications in food pathogens monitoring. Moreover, the strengths and weaknesses of plasmonic biosensors implementation in food control are showcased. Key findings and conclusions: Plasmonic biosensors could simplify procedure and radically reduce time, price and consummation of reactants, compared to traditional microbiological methods. Optical biosensors, in particular SPR, have been developed for detection of different foodborne pathogens. In parallel, analytical improvements have been achieved by coupling different techniques (fiber optics, Raman, fluorescence, luminescence) to plasmonic sensors in order to reduce the limits of detection and to improve sensitivity. The future improvements include the miniaturization of instruments to handheld devices and simplification of analysis to enable direct target detection in food matrices. Plasmonic technology can certainly have long lasting impact because the need for a simple and rapid food assay is pressing and guarantees the future development in this field.
[5]: Optical biosensors have been commercially available since the early 1990s, and have been used extensively in many areas of research in the life sciences. Optical biosensors developed for drug analysis generally exploit the high selectivity of the antigen-antibody and drug-protein interaction. Optical biosensors can be made based on optical diffraction or electro- chemiluminescence. High throughput screening, (HTS) which includes automated preparation of a large number of samples and then screening of their properties in multi-well plates, improves the efficiency of research in many scientific areas, e.g., catalyst screening, food processing, chemical synthesis, drug discovery, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and toxicological and cell based screening. The three most common detection techniques used in HTS are UV-VIS absorbance, fluorescence and luminescence.

To predict responses of floodplain forests to climate change, it is necessary to determine the climatic controls over tree growth and vessel anatomy. We analysed the responses of tree-ring width and earlywood vessel anatomical parameters (average vessel lumen area, vessel density and total vessel lumen area) of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) growing in a floodplain to hydroclimatic conditions represented by temperature, the drought index (scPDSI), river discharge, groundwater level, and occurrence of floods and drought events. Site chronologies were assembled for floodplain and reference sites and, subsequently, correlated with time series of hydroclimatic conditions. Our results show that radial growth of floodplain trees is particularly positively influenced by temperature during the growing season and during previous year's summer. By contrast, the growth of reference trees is highly drought-limited. Earlywood average vessel lumen area chronologies from both floodplain and reference sites share a positive temperature signal from January to April. However, the effect of water availability (indicated by the drought index) on vessel size is mostly negative for floodplain trees (with a maximum response to the autumn of the year preceding tree-ring formation) and positive or non-significant for reference trees. Vessel density chronologies contain the inverse environmental information as tree-ring width, however, with amplified negative correlations with current year temperatures at floodplain sites. Total vessel area is associated mostly with temperature in previous May and June. The drought index recorded exactly the same information in tree-rings as did river discharges and groundwater levels. The results of both correlation and trend analysis evidence that tree-ring width of floodplain Q. robur unambiguously increases with increasing temperature; on the other hand, droughts can become a serious problem affecting the productivity of reference trees growing in more distal parts of the lowland. Vessel size of Q. robur growing outside the floodplain recently tends to increase with increasing temperatures, making xylem more effective at water transport but also more vulnerable to cavitation.",Unrelated and unverifiable

Technology itself has advanced from the mere encoding of human knowledge into a machine to designing machines that ""know how"" to autonomously acquire the knowledge they need, learn from it and act independently in the environment. Fortunately, this need is not new; it has scientific grounds that could be traced back to the inception of computers. This paper uses a multi-disciplinary lens to explore how the natural cognitive intelligence in a human could interface with the artificial cognitive intelligence of a machine. The scientific journey over the last 50 years will be examined to understand the Human-AI relationship, and to present the nature of, and the role of trust in, this relationship. Risks and opportunities sitting at the human-AI interface will be studied to reveal some of the fundamental technical challenges for a trustworthy human-AI relationship. The critical assessment of the literature leads to the conclusion that any social integration of AI into the human social system would necessitate a form of a relationship on one level or another in society, meaning that humans will ""always"" actively participate in certain decision-making loops—either in-the-loop or on-the-loop—that will influence the operations of AI, regardless of how sophisticated it is.
[8]: We aimed to contribute to the emerging field of human-computer interaction by revealing some of the cues we use to distinguish humans from machines. Maybe the most well-known method of inquiry in artificial intelligence is the Turing test, in which participants have to judge whether their conversation partner is either a machine or human. In two studies, we used the Turing test as an opportunity to reveal the factors influencing Turing decisions. In our first study, we created a situation similar to a Turing test: a written, online conversation and we hypothesized that if the other entity expresses a view different from ours, we might think that they are a member of another group, in this case, the group of machines. We measured the attitude of the participants (N = 100) before the conversation, then we compared the attitude difference of the partners to their Turing decision. Our results showed a significant relationship between the Turing decision and the attitude difference of the conversation partners. The more difference between attitudes correlated with a more likely decision of the other being a machine. With our second study, we wanted to widen the range of variables and we also wanted to measure their effect in a more controlled, systematic way. In this case, our participants (N = 632) were exposed to an excerpt of a manipulated Turing test transcription. The dialogues were modified based on 8 variables: humour, grammar, activity, the similarity of attitude, coherence, leading the conversation, emoji use, and the appearance of the interface. Our results showed that logical answers, proper grammar, and similar attitudes predicted the Turing decisions best. We also found that more people considered mistaking a computer for a human being a bigger problem than vice versa and this choice was greatly influenced by the participants' negative attitudes towards robots.

To protect IoT systems, email classification is an essential mechanism to classify spam and legitimate emails. In the literature, most email classification approaches adopt supervised learning algorithms that require a large number of labeled data for classifier training. However, data labeling is very time consuming and expensive, making only a very small set of data available in practice, which would greatly degrade the effectiveness of email classification. To mitigate this problem, in this work, we develop an email classification approach based on multi-view disagreement-based semi-supervised learning. The idea behind is that multi-view method can offer richer information for classification, which is often ignored by the literature. The use of semi-supervised learning can help leverage both labeled and unlabeled data. In the evaluation, we investigate the performance of our proposed approach with two datasets and in a real network environment.

These differences flow directly from the different policy and economic perspectives on emissions trading and climate policy in the USA and the EU. The two sides should therefore seek a way forward that reconciles potentially different climate policies. For example, the USA and the EU should consider an effort to harmonize carbon prices, and US legislation could phase out cost-containment mechanisms after some time period. Finally, both US and EU policies should have mechanisms that allow periodic recalibration, which would allow each to adjust to new technology, react to developing-country climate policies, and learn from each other.

Because global climate models operate on spatial scales that typically are too coarse for aquatic biologists, statistical or dynamical downscaling of model output is proposed. Challenges in using climate projections exist; however, projections for some marine and freshwater systems are possible.

The East Australia Current is projected to transport greater volumes of water southward, whereas the Leeuwin Current on the western coast may weaken.

A key element of effective disease management for diabetes is support for patient self-management. Barriers to care exist for both patients and healthcare systems. As a result, many people with diabetes do not get the care and support needed to successfully manage their diabetes.Disease management approaches that incorporate peer support may be a promising way to help provide self-management support to patients with diabetes. Trained peers provide emotional support, instrumental (tangible or material) support, education, and skills training to those they serve, and outreach and care coordination for provider systems. They play a unique role that complements and supports clinical care.To describe how peers are currently supporting diabetes care, a number of databases were searched for studies describing the roles of peers using relevant key words. This paper reviews current literature that describes the roles and duties of peers in interventions to improve diabetes care, with a focus on their contributions to six essential elements of self-management support: (i) access to regular, high-quality clinical care; (ii) an individualized approach to assessment and treatment; (iii) patient-centered collaborative goal setting; (iv) education and skills training; (v) ongoing follow-up and support; and (vi) linkages to community resources.Peers worked under a variety of titles, which did not define their duties. The scope of their work ranged from assisting health professionals to playing a central role in care. Providing education and follow-up support were the two most common roles. In all but one study, these roles were carried out during face-to-face contact, most frequently in community sites.A growing body of literature supports the value of peer models for diabetes management. Additional research can answer remaining questions related to such issues as cost effectiveness, sustainability, integration of peers into health and social service delivery systems, and recruitment, training, and support of peers. Continuing to develop and evaluate innovative models for more effectively mobilizing and integrating peers into diabetes care has great potential for improving diabetes outcomes worldwide. © 2009 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved. [13] Purpose of Review: The goal of this review is to describe diabetes within a population health improvement framework and to review the evidence for a diabetes population health continuum of intervention approaches, including diabetes prevention and chronic and acute diabetes management, to improve clinical and economic outcomes. Recent Findings: Recent studies have shown that compared to usual care, lifestyle interventions in prediabetes lower diabetes risk at the population-level and that group-based programs have low incremental medial cost effectiveness ratio for health systems. Effective outpatient interventions that improve diabetes control and process outcomes are multi-level, targeting the patient, provider, and healthcare system simultaneously and integrate community health workers as a liaison between the patient and community-based healthcare resources. A multi-faceted approach to diabetes management is also effective in the inpatient setting. Interventions shown to promote safe and effective glycemic control and use of evidence-based glucose management practices include provider reminder and clinical decision support systems, automated computer order entry, provider education, and organizational change. Summary: Future studies should examine the cost-effectiveness of multi-faceted outpatient and inpatient diabetes management programs to determine the best financial models for incorporating them into diabetes population health strategies. [16] Purpose. Evolving elements of best practices for providing targeted glycemic control in the hospital setting, clinical performance measurement, basal-bolus plus correction-dose insulin regimens, components of standardized subcutaneous (s.c.) insulin order sets, and strategies for implementation and cost justification of glycemic control initiatives are discussed. Summary. Best practices for targeted glycemic control should address accurate documentation of hyperglycemia, initial patient assessment, management plan, target blood glucose range, blood glucose monitoring frequency, maintenance of glycemic control, criteria for glucose management consultations, and standardized insulin order sets and protocols. Establishing clinical performance measures, including desirable processes and outcomes, can help ensure the success of targeted hospital glycemic control initiatives. The basal-bolus plus correction-dose regimen for insulin administration will be used to mimic the normal physiologic pattern of endogenous insulin secretion. Standardized insulin order sets and protocols are being used to minimize the risk of error in insulin therapy. Components of standardized s.c. insulin order sets include specification of the hyperglycemia diagnosis, finger stick blood glucose monitoring frequency and timing, target blood glucose concentration range, cutoff values for excessively high or low blood glucose concentrations that warrant alerting the physician, basal and prandial or nutritional (i.e., bolus) insulin, correction doses, hypoglycemia treatment, and perioperative or procedural dosage adjustments. The endorsement of hospital administrators and key physician and nursing leaders is needed for glycemic control initiatives. Initiatives may be cost justified on the basis of the billings for clinical diabetes management services and/or the return-on-investment accrued to reductions in hospital length of stay, readmissions, and accurate documentation and coding of unrecognized or uncontrolled diabetes, and diabetes complications. Conclusion. Standardized insulin order sets and protocols may minimize risk of insulin errors. The endorsement of these protocols by administrators, physicians, nurses, and pharmacists is also needed for success. Copyright © 2007, American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, Inc.

i_110,Unverifiable,Combining visual cues with textual explanations can improve the interpretability and effectiveness of explanations .,"[6] Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), researchers have asked how intelligent computing systems could interact with and relate to their users and their surroundings, leading to debates around issues of biased AI systems, ML black-box, user trust, user's perception of control over the system, and system's transparency, to name a few. All of these issues are related to how humans interact with AI or ML systems, through an interface which uses different interaction modalities. Prior studies address these issues from a variety of perspectives, spanning from understanding and framing the problems through ethics and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives to finding effective technical solutions to the problems. But what is shared among almost all those efforts is an assumption that if systems can explain the how and why of their predictions, people will have a better perception of control and therefore will trust such systems more, and even can correct their shortcomings. This research field has been called Explainable AI (XAI). In this studio, we take stock on prior efforts in this area; however, we focus on using Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) as an interaction modality for understanding ML. We note that the affordances of physical forms and their behaviors potentially can not only contribute to the explainability of ML systems, but also can contribute to an open environment for criticism. This studio seeks to both critique explainable ML terminology and to map the opportunities that TEI can offer to the HCI for designing more sustainable, graspable and just intelligent systems.",Unrelated and unverifiable
s_1152,Contradiction,"Epidemiology: Prevalence: CD affects approximately 2% of the population worldwide, with increasing prevalence noted in recent decades .","Celiac disease is a chronic, generically linked, autoimmune disorder that is also known as celiac sprue, nontropical sprue, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Although celiac disease primarily affects the small intestine, deleterious effects can occur throughout the entire body. Patients with celiac disease are unable to tolerate the ingestion of gluten. Gluten is an insoluble protein found in all cereal grains. The gluten that is found in wheat, rye, and barley is the offending culprit for celiac disease patients. The prevalence in the United States is estimated to effect 1% of the population. The following article is designed to help identify medications that may contain gluten.
[6]: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the permanent inflammation of the small bowel, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. It is associated with a number of symptoms, the most common being gastrointestinal. The prevalence of this illness worldwide is 1%. One of the main problems of CD is its difficulty to be diagnosed due to the various presentations of the disease. Besides, in many cases, CD is asymptomatic. Celiac disease is a multifactorial disease, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes are predisposition factors. Nowadays, molecular markers are being studied as diagnostic tools. In this review, we explore CD from its basic concept, manifestations, types, current and future methods of diagnosis, and associated disorders. Before addressing the therapeutic approaches, we also provide a brief overview of CD genetics and treatment.
[12]: Celiac disease is a common, chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine triggered by exposure to gluten in individuals with certain genetic types. This disorder affects people of any age or gender. Although often thought to be European in origin, it is now global in extent. Presentations are variable, from asymptomatic patients to severe malnutrition. Initial detection usually relies on celiac-specific serology, and confirmation often requires intestinal biopsy. There have been substantial increases in prevalence and incidence over the last 2 decades for reasons that are almost certainly environmental but for which there is no clarity as to cause.",Numeric error

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with injuries that were primarily caused by yoga. Patients were seen from January 1, 2006, through December 31, 2018. Injuries were categorized into 3 groups: (1) soft tissue injury, (2) axial nonbony injury, and (3) bony injury. Patients underwent evaluation and were counseled to modify exercise activity. Results: We identified 89 patients for inclusion in the study. Within the soft tissue group, 66 patients (74.2%) had mechanical myofascial pain due to overuse. Rotator cuff injury was seen in 6 (6.7%), and trochanteric bursopathy was observed in 1 (1.1%). In the axial group, exacerbation of pain in degenerative joint disease (46 patients [51.7%]) and facet arthropathy (n=34 [38.2%]) were observed. Radiculopathy was seen in 5 patients (5.6%). Within the bony injury category, kyphoscoliosis was seen on imaging in 15 patients (16.9%). Spondylolisthesis was present in 15 patients (16.9%). Anterior wedging was seen in 16 (18.0%), and compression fractures were present in 13 (14.6%). The poses that were most commonly identified as causing the injuries involved hyperflexion and hyperextension of the spine. We correlated the kinesiologic effect of such exercises on specific musculoskeletal structures. Conclusion: Yoga potentially has many benefits, but care must be taken when performing positions with extreme spinal flexion and extension. Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis may have higher risk of compression fractures or deformities and would benefit from avoiding extreme spinal flexion. Physicians should consider this risk when discussing yoga as exercise. [11] Uncertainty about Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and resulting lockdown caused widespread panic, stress, and anxiety. Yoga is a known practice that reduces stress and anxiety and may enhance immunity. This study aimed to (1) investigate that including Yoga in daily routine is beneficial for physical and mental health, and (2) to evaluate lifestyle of Yoga practitioners that may be instrumental in coping with stress associated with lockdown. This is a pan-India cross-sectional survey study, which was conducted during the lockdown. A self-rated scale, COVID Health Assessment Scale (CHAS), was designed by 11 experts in 3 Delphi rounds (Content valid ratio = 0.85) to evaluate the physical health, mental health, lifestyle, and coping skills of the individuals. The survey was made available digitally using Google forms and collected 23,760 CHAS responses. There were 23,290 valid responses (98%). After the study's inclusion and exclusion criteria of yogic practices, the respondents were categorized into the Yoga (n = 9,840) and Non-Yoga (n = 3,377) groups, who actively practiced Yoga during the lockdown in India. The statistical analyses were performed running logistic and multinomial regression and calculating odds ratio estimation using R software version 4.0.0. The non-Yoga group was more likely to use substances and unhealthy food and less likely to have good quality sleep. Yoga practitioners reported good physical ability and endurance. Yoga group also showed less anxiety, stress, fear, and having better coping strategies than the non-Yoga group. The Yoga group displayed striking and superior ability to cope with stress and anxiety associated with lockdown and COVID-19. In the Yoga group, participants performing meditation reportedly had relatively better mental health. Yoga may lead to risk reduction of COVID-19 by decreasing stress and improving immunity if specific yoga protocols are implemented through a global public health initiative. [15] Background: Nineteen million adults worldwide are in need of palliative care. Of those who have access to it, 80% fail to receive an efficient management of symptoms. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of mindfulness meditation for palliative care patients. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, PEDro, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Opengrey, ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO-ICTRP. No restriction of language, status or date of publication was applied. We considered randomised clinical trials (RCTs) comparing any mindfulness meditation scheme vs any comparator for palliative care. Cochrane Risk of Bias (Rob) Table was used for assessing methodological quality of RCTs. Screening, data extraction and methodological assessments were performed by two reviewers. Mean differences (MD) (confidence intervals of 95% (CI 95%)) were considered for estimating effect size. Quality of evidence was appraised by GRADE. Results: Four RCTs, 234 participants, were included. All studies presented high risk of bias in at least one RoB table criteria. We assessed 4 comparisons, but only 2 studies showed statistically significant difference for at least one outcome. 1. Mindfulness meditation (eight weeks, one session/week, daily individual practice) vs control: statistically significant difference in favour of control for quality of life - physical aspects. 2. Mindfulness meditation (single 5-minute session) vs control: benefit in favour of mindfulness for stress outcome in both time-points. None of the included studies analysed safety and harms outcomes. Conclusions: Although two studies have showed statistically significant difference, only one showed effectiveness of mindfulness meditation in improving perceived stress. This study focused on one single session of mindfulness of 5 minutes for adult cancer patients in palliative care, but it was considered as possessing high risk of bias. Other schemes of mindfulness meditation did not show benefit in any outcome evaluated (low and very low quality evidence).",Unrelated and unverifiable

BSV sequences present in the genome of Musa balbisiana hamper the detection of cognate episomal viruses by PCR, since PCR results in the amplification of both episomal viral DNA and integrated viral sequences, leading to false positives. A simple single-step multiplex immunocapture PCR (M-IC-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of only episomal BSV. This technique was applied in a study of the occurrence of BSV in Guadeloupe. Leaf samples from the main banana genotypes were indexed for the presence of major BSV species. Although no symptoms could be observed, BSV was found to be common in plantain (AAB), probably as a result of the widespread use of contaminated suckers. In contrast, BSV was uncommon on dessert banana cultivars (AAA), showing that the use of virus-free certified in vitro plants is an efficient strategy for controlling the spread of BSV, and that vector-borne transmission of BSV from plantain to dessert banana is very low in Guadeloupe. Our study also showed that Banana streak GF virus is the most prevalent species in Guadeloupe, with species Banana streak OL virus and Banana streak Mysore virus present at much lower levels. Using the same leaf samples, a study on the occurrence and diversity of Banana virus X (BVX), a member of the Flexiviridae family, which has been recently described and characterised in Guadeloupe, was undertaken. Indexing by direct-binding reverse transcription PCR showed that BVX is very uncommon in Guadeloupe and has a low level of molecular diversity. This is in contrast to Banana mild mosaic virus, which is a closely related member of the Flexiviridae family, and for which an immunocapture reverse transcription nested PCR detection method was established.",Unrelated and unverifiable

One of the most common cross-reactivity syndromes is pollen-food syndrome (PFS). The patient is sensitized with pollen by the airways and exhibits an allergic reaction to food antigen with a structural similarity to the pollen. PFS usually presents with pruritus and swelling of the mouth and throat during or just after ingestion of fresh, uncooked fruits and vegetables. Latex fruit syndrome is another cross-reactivity syndrome. It is the association of latex allergy and allergy to plant foods, which affects up to 50% of latex-allergic patients. Here, we present two cases with crossreactivity syndrome.  [9] Background: The order Fagales represents an important cause of tree-pollen allergy in northern countries. We investigated the IgE recognition profiles, mutual relationships, and association with clinical symptoms of a panel of allergens belonging to the PR-10 family, the main proteins responsible for Fagales allergy (Act d 8, Aln g 1, Api g 1, Ara h 8, Bet v 1, Cor a 1.0101, Cor a 1.0401, Gly m 4, Mal d 1, and Pru p 1). Methods: A total of 526 PR-10-reactive subjects living in central and southern Italy were studied by ImmunoCAP-ISAC-112 microarray analysis. Results: Overall, Bet v 1 reactivity was the most commonly (74%) observed among PR-10 proteins, but Cor a 1.0101 was the most prevalent in participants aged <6 years, and between 15 and 65 years. Overall, 26% of the PR-10-reactive persons were Bet v 1 negative, whilst 93.6% of the PR-10 polyreactive individuals were Bet v 1 positive. Among the 10 PR-10s evaluated, 100 combinations were recorded. The strongest association was observed between molecules with the highest sequence identities (Bet v 1 and Cor a 1.0101, Cor a 1.0401 or Aln g 1; Mal d 1 and Pru p 1). Bet v 1-, Cor a 1.0101-, and Aln g 1-specific IgE recognition was associated with respiratory symptoms, whilst Ara h 8, Cor a 1.0401, Gly m 4, Mal d 1, and Pru p 1 were selectively linked to an oral allergic syndrome.

s_1727,Contradiction,Initial Flooding: The rice field is initially flooded to a depth of about 5-15 cm to establish the crop and suppress weed growth .,"The supply of irrigation in Thailand is currently insufficient to satisfy rice production demands, despite the country being the world's leading rice producer and exporter. Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.",Missing information

Comparing with maintainer line 209B, WX209B showed decreased amylose contents and similar agronomic characters. And then, through one generation of hybridization and two generations of backcrossing with WX209B as the male parent and 209A as the female parent, the glutinous CMS line WX209A was successfully achieved. Our study provides a strategy to efficiently breed for the glutinous cytoplasmic male sterile line by combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technology with conventional backcross breeding method in a short period, which prepares the ground for further breeding of hybrid glutinous rice variety. [11] A field experiment was conducted from June to December, 2013 to study the genetic diversity of 15 modern T. Aman rice varieties of Bangladesh (Oryza sativa L.) with a view to assess the superior genotype in future hybridization program for developing new rice varieties that is suitable for the target environment. Analysis of variance for each trait showed significant differences among the varieties. High heritability associated with high genetic advance in percent of mean was observed for plant height and thousand seed weight which indicated that selection for these characters would be effective. Hence, thrust has to be given for these characters in future breeding program to improve the yield trait in rice. Multivariate analysis based on 10 agronomic characters indicated that the 15 varieties were grouped into four distant clusters. The inter cluster distance was maximum between cluster II and cluster IV. The highest intra-cluster distance was found in cluster IV. Based on positive value of vector 1 and vector 2, plant height and 1000-seed weight had maximum contribution towards genetic divergence.

Evidence: Cone-shaped tubes demonstrated about 35% lower air flow resistance and a 20% reduction in RWOB compared to standard tubes in a model study .,"Aim: Two types of uncuffed paediatric tubes of different designs: a standard tube with a constant internal diameter and a new tube of smooth cone shape were assessed in the model study. Material and Method: The tube resistance to air flow was calculated on the basis of measurements, in which pressure/flow characteristics of the tubes of 3, 3.5 and 4 mm in inner (tracheal) diameter were collected. The flow was controlled by PC and ranged from –30 to +30 lpm. It was measured by a flow sensor (Cole Parmer 00139RN, accuracy: 1%), while the drop of pressure along a tube length was measured by a pressure sensor (JUMO dTrans pO2 B40.4385, accuracy: 0,05%). Patient's resistive work of breathing (RWOB) was received by simulation of spontaneous breathing of an intubated infant. Simple RC-model of lungs and an endotracheal tube was used for simulation. Results: The air flow resistance of the cone shaped tube was about 40% lower than resistance of the standard tube. RWOB of the virtual infant intubated with the cone tube was decreased by about 20%, in comparison to the situation when a standard tube was used. Conclusion: Using the new cone shaped tube can be more beneficial than the standard tube from a patient's point of view (when his lungs ventilation is still supported but he is able to breath spontaneously) and ventilation efficiency.

It was demonstrated for the use case of MNIST database of handwritten digits in single-threaded mode that blind selection of these parameters can hugely increase (by 2–3 orders) the runtime without the significant increase of precision. This result can have crucial influence for optimization of available and new machine learning methods, especially for image recognition problems. [18] Biomedical applications often require classifiers that are both accurate and cheap to implement. Today, deep neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy in most learning tasks that involve large data sets of unstructured data. However, the application of deep learning techniques may not be beneficial in problems with limited training sets and computational resources, or under domain-specific test time constraints. Among other algorithms, ensembles of decision trees, particularly the gradient boosted models have recently been very successful in machine learning competitions. Here, we propose an efficient hardware architecture to implement gradient boosted trees in applications under stringent power, area, and delay constraints, such as medical devices. Specifically, we introduce the concepts of asynchronous tree operation and sequential feature extraction to achieve an unprecedented energy and area efficiency. The proposed architecture is evaluated in automated seizure detection for epilepsy, using 3074 h of intracranial EEG data from 26 patients with 393 seizures. Average F1 scores of 99.23% and 87.86% are achieved for random and block-wise splitting of data into train/test sets, respectively, with an average detection latency of 1.1 s. The proposed classifier is fabricated in a 65-nm TSMC process, consuming 41.2 nJ/class in a total area of 540 × 1850 μm<sup>2</sup>. This design improves the state-of-the-art by 27 × reduction in energy-area-latency product. Moreover, the proposed gradient-boosting architecture offers the flexibility to accommodate variable tree counts specific to each patient, to trade the predictive accuracy with energy. This patient-specific and energy-quality scalable classifier holds great promise for low-power sensor data classification in biomedical applications.",Unrelated and unverifiable

For achieving these goals, various models have been experimented amongst which Circular Economy (CE) is one of the economic models facilitating key policy objectives for generating economic growth and reducing environmental impacts. In economies, cities are focal points of strengthening the transition of linear to a circular economy by smart practices towards a regenerative system. By consuming the assets at their highest utility, there will be an increase in economic resilience of the city and its citizens. The Smart Cities (SCs) and Smart Cities Mission (SCM) of India, Make in India, Digital India, and the Swachh Bharat Mission has potential to integrate CE principles in a pronounced way to pave the way towards a circular transition. To fulfill the SCs objectives, Indian cities have been integrating smart practices (like waste management, e-governance, and smart mobility) with circularity. For the challenges faced by the cities from the design until the implementation phase, circular economy calls for a refit in resource management. These would require policy-level reforms, institutional capacity building, uplifting infrastructure, and financing mechanisms. In India, there is already an existing repair and refurbish culture with strong local traditions integrating the 6Rs. The paper reviews the role of CE in Indian SCM for achieving SDGs by finding opportunities for circular economy and providing recommendations based on them.

In arid environments, the structure of the root system could be changed to maintain normal biology function and adapt to stress conditions. To date, most of the studies have focused on the structure or morphology of root system responses to single stress factors. However, less attention has been concentrated on the adaptive mechanism of the entire root structure to different ecotopes. Therefore, this study explored the root morphological plasticity of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa in response to natural drought gradient ecotopes. Root samples were selected from Yantai-Shijiazhuang-Yinchuan-Turpan of China. The four ecotopes formed a natural drought gradient environment according to their soil moisture, annual precipitation, and humidity coefficients. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanism of root plasticity response to different environments caused by climate change. The results showed that root primary structure of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa included the epidermis, cortex, and vascular cylinder. The epidermis is on the surface of the young root, which is constituted by a single layer of epidermis cells that are small and arranged closely. The cortex takes the greatest proportion of the primary structure, and it is constituted by a larger quantity of parenchymal cells. The vascular cylinder is located in the innermost layer, and the cells are small and crowded together. It is composed of pericycle, primary xylem, primary phloem, and parenchymal cells. When drought aggravated, the thickness and width of the epidermis cells were increased. In addition, the thickness, width, and number of plies of parenchymal cells, and the thickness of the cortex were all largest at the Yinchuan ecotope. The root secondary structure of Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa was divided into periderm (phellem layer, phellogen, phelloderm) and secondary vascular tissue (secondary phloem, vascular cambium, secondary xylem). As the drought intensified from Yantai to Turpan, the thickness and density of periderm was gradually increased. In addition, the diameter and quantity of vessels in secondary xylem were increased. These results illustrated that one of the adaptive mechanisms of plant to drought stress is the changes in the plasticity of root structure that enhance water uptake capacity and water transport efficiency. On the other hand, it improves water retaining capacity and decreases water desorption.
[3]: Plant hydraulics is key for plant survival and growth because it is linked to gas exchange and drought resistance. Although the environment influences plant hydraulics, there is no clear consensus on the effect of nitrogen (N) supply, which may be, in part, due to different hydraulic conductance normalization criteria and studied species. The objective of this study was to compare the variation of root hydraulic properties using several normalization criteria in four pine species in response to three contrasting N fertilization regimes. We studied four closely related, yet ecologically distinct species: Pinus nigra J.F. Arnold, Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus pinea L. and Pinus halepensis Mill. Root hydraulic conductance (Kh) was measured with a high-pressure flow meter, and values were normalized by total leaf area (leaf specific conductance, Kl), xylem cross-section area (xylem specific conductance, Ks), total root area (root specific conductance, Kr) and the area of fine roots (fine root specific conductance, Kfr). Controlling for organ size differences allowed comparison of the hydraulic efficiency of roots to supply or absorb water among fertilization treatments and species. The effect of N on the root hydraulic efficiency depended on the normalization criteria. Increasing N availability reduced Kl and Ks, but increased Kh, Kr and especially Kfr. The positive effect of N on Kr and Kfr was positively related to seedling relative growth rate and was also consistent with published results at the interspecific level, whereby plant hydraulics is positively linked to photosynthesis and transpiration rate and fast growth. In contrast, normalization by leaf area and xylem cross-sectional area (Kl and Ks) reflected opposite responses to Kr and Kfr. This indicates that the normalization criteria determine the interpretation of the effect of N on plant hydraulics, which can limit species and treatment comparisons.",Missing information

Validation Techniques: High-Throughput Methods: Utilize high-throughput methods such as active community profiling (ACP) to validate the activity and composition of microbial cultures. This method distinguishes active from inactive cells, providing a more accurate representation of the community .","[3] Culture collections contain indispensable information about the microorganisms preserved in their repositories, such as taxonomical descriptions, origins, physiological and biochemical characteristics, bibliographic references, etc. However, information currently accessible in databases rarely adheres to common standard protocols. The resultant heterogeneity between culture collections, in terms of both content and format, notably hampers microorganism-based research and development (R&D). The optimized exploitation of these resources thus requires standardized, and simplified, access to the associated information. To this end, and in the interest of supporting R&D in the fields of agriculture, health and biotechnology, a pan-European distributed research infrastructure, MIRRI, including over 40 public culture collections and research institutes from 19 European countries, was established. A prime objective of MIRRI is to unite and provide universal access to the fragmented, and untapped, resources, information and expertise available in European public collections of microorganisms; a key component of which is to develop a dynamic Information System. For the first time, both culture collection curators as well as their users have been consulted and their feedback, concerning the needs and requirements for collection databases and data accessibility, utilised. Users primarily noted that databases were not interoperable, thus rendering a global search of multiple databases impossible. Unreliable or out-of-date and, in particular, non-homogenous, taxonomic information was also considered to be a major obstacle to searching microbial data efficiently. Moreover, complex searches are rarely possible in online databases thus limiting the extent of search queries. Curators also consider that overall harmonization—including Standard Operating Procedures, data structure, and software tools—is necessary to facilitate their work and to make high-quality data easily accessible to their users. Clearly, the needs of culture collection curators coincide with those of users on the crucial point of database interoperability. In this regard, and in order to design an appropriate Information System, important aspects on which the culture collection community should focus include: the interoperability of data sets with the ontologies to be used; setting best practice in data management, and the definition of an appropriate data standard.",Unrelated and unverifiable
i_1415,Contradiction,"Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS): Robotic Surgery: An advanced form of MIS, robotic surgery offers precision and control, particularly beneficial for complex gastrointestinal procedures .","The advent of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) brought a major deviation in trend from conventional surgery. Since the introduction of first laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 1985, many operations for gastrointestinal diseases adopted MIS technique in a relatively short period of time. These MIS operations yielded better outcomes when compared to their open counterparts: less pain, shorter hospital stay, faster recovery, and better cosmetics. More complex surgical procedures for benign and malignant diseases of gastrointestinal tract are currently being performed by MIS technique with the improvement in equipment, instrumentation, and surgical skills. At the forefront of MIS, lies robotics. This paper briefly reviews the current status of MIS in the field of gastrointestinal diseases.
[3]: The development of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) using laparoscopy and robotics has revolutionized the postoperative course of digestive surgery. By decreasing surgical trauma, the minimally invasive approach minimizes postoperative pain, enhances postoperative recovery, and reduces length of stay and hospital costs. This ""surgical revolution"", which has spanned over the last thirty years, has not fully advanced the field of pancreatic surgery. Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), which is usually performed by an open approach, still represents a technically demanding operation with a steep learning curve and high postoperative morbidity and consequent mortality. The postoperative complications of PDs require treatment from multidisciplinary healthcare management teams in highly experienced institutions, so PDs should be restricted to high volume centres. In this article, we have reviewed the reasons for the reluctance of pancreatic surgeons to perform PDs by MIS, the clinical outcomes from minimally invasive PDs, and the expectations of pancreatic surgeons of MIS. After reviewing the literature, morbidity and mortality of MIS PD seems to be comparable to open surgery, but a recent randomized trial was prematurely interrupted due to higher mortality in the laparoscopic arm. Long-term survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma seems to be comparable between MIS PD and open surgery. MIS PD achieves statistically significantly decreased blood loss at the expense of increased operative time compared with open PD. Quality metrics and new scores should be developed in order to further evaluate and compare the outcomes from open and/or MIS pancreatic resection.",Missing information

i_201,Contradiction,"Conclusion: While smart cities offer significant potential for improving urban living conditions, addressing the challenges of digital inclusivity is essential. By focusing on citizen engagement, data literacy, accessibility, and equitable access to technology, smart cities can become more inclusive and beneficial for all residents. Implementing solutions like the Personal Accessibility Environment and Tech Justice can help bridge the digital divide and ensure that smart city initiatives are truly inclusive .","The holy grail of smart cities is an integrated, sustainable approach to improve the efficiency of the city's operations and the quality of life of citizens. At the heart of this vision is the citizen, who is the primary beneficiary of smart city initiatives, either directly or indirectly. Despite the recent surge of research and smart cities initiatives in practice, there are still a number of challenges to overcome in realizing this vision. This position paper points out six citizen-related challenges: the engagement of citizens, the improvement of citizens' data literacy, the pairing of quantitative and qualitative data, the need for open standards, the development of personal services, and the development of persuasive interfaces. The article furthermore advocates the use of methods and techniques from GIScience to tackle these challenges, and presents the concept of an Open City Toolkit as a way of transferring insights and solutions from GIScience to smart cities.
[3]: The concept of smart cities refers to urban areas that utilize (digital) technologies to enhance urban operations, services, and the quality of life of their residents. However, people have varying possibilities and capabilities for using (digital) technologies. This intertwines the technology-driven urban development with the ideal of inclusiveness (or the lack thereof) as it seems unrealistic to assume that smart cities would benefit equally the whole society. This controversy is approached by questioning whether smart cities can really improve the living conditions of the disadvantaged via reviewing the literature that ties technology-driven urban development to persons with disabilities. The study shows, first, that disabilities are rarely discussed in the extant literature on smart cities particularly from a critical perspective. Second, it is underlined here, based on the reviewed literature, that while smart city initiatives hold promise for enhancing urban living conditions of persons with disabilities, they are not one-size-fits-all answers to tackle the marginalization of persons with disabilities. Rather, since technological solutions do not counter the fundamental barriers of exclusion, urban technologies still need advanced ideas in establishing a truly inclusive smart city.
[4]: New technological advances and use of new mobile applications facilitate a easy access to multiple possibilities in smart cities. However, the use of technology does not solve inclusion problems of citizens who, due to their social or personal conditions, cannot use them adequately. Also, these people are incapacitated, even more, to participate as active citizens in their city. Creating a new non-architectural barriers, but technological ones, which are more difficult to understand. This study employs the direct observation of people with low vision or blindness, to check the difficulties and needs they present in the use of different applications from Android and iOS systems. And as results, it is verified that all of them need complementary applications, which in many cases are not compatible with those designed for other people. And therefore, they cannot access to all the resources in the smart city. To solve it is proposed the creation of a Personal Accessibility Environment (PAE) to allow an access to a set of all necessary contents to interact with the environment in their locations.
[5]: Internet of Things, Internet of Everything and Internet of People are concepts suggesting that objects, devices, and people will be increasingly interconnected through digital infrastructure that will generate a growing gathering of data. Parallel to this development is the celebration of the smart city and sharing city as urban policy visions that by relying heavily on new technologies bear the promise of efficient and thriving cities. Law and policy scholarship have either focused on questions related to privacy, discrimination, security, or issues related to the production and use of big data, digital public services. Little or no attention has been paid to the disruptive impact of technological development on urban governance and city inhabitants' rights of equal access, participation, management and even ownership, in order to understand whether and how technology can also enhance the protection of human rights and social justice in the city. This Article proposes complementing the technological and digital infrastructure with a legal and governance infrastructure, the Internet of Humans, by construing and injecting in the policy framework of the city the principle of Tech Justice. Building on a literature review and from an analysis of selected case studies, this Article stresses the dichotomy existing between the market-based and the society-based applications of technology, the first likely to increase the digital divide and the challenges to human rights in the city, the latter bearing the promise to promote equal access to technology in the city. The main argument advanced by this Article is that the principle of Tech Justice if embedded as an empirical dimension of smart city and sharing city policies can steer their developments in the direction of a more just and democratic city.",Missing information

The main problem emanates from the challenges of the audit of each aspect of the material processing, and especially the quantification of the relevant transport, energy, environmental and other inputs into the composite product. Incorporation of materials with long and complex recycling processes further exacerbate the challenge. This paper reports on a simplified approach towards full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of seven clay-based brick products developed in UK and in Spain, based on known material data and estimated energy inputs in the manufacturing processes. In order to test the robustness of the proposed approach, results on UK-based bricks are compared with a parallel LCA on clay-based product developed in Spain. Finally, the clay-based products are compared with a typical Portland cement-based concrete block and fired clay brick. In the LCA, boundary conditions include fixed transport, thus attempting to factor only the (i) material ingredients, (ii) their known atmospheric emissions, and (iii) estimated energy inputs during processing. Results suggest that the most challenging aspect in the undertaking of LCA is the availability of reliable input data.

i_2309,Contradiction,"However, it can be inferred that extreme temperatures (30°C and 33°C) likely led to high mortality, suggesting that any temperature above 30°C is detrimental .","The effects of salinity and temperature on performance were determined for Australian snapper, Pagrus auratus first-feeding to pre-metamorphosis larvae held in 100-l recirculation tanks. In the first experiment, performance was assessed after transfer from 35‰ at eight salinity treatments (5‰, 10‰, 15‰, 20‰, 25‰ 30‰, 35‰ and 45‰) in larvae from 3 to 21 days after hatching (dah). Survival of larvae was best within the range of 20-35‰. Final size of larvae was similar within the range of 10-35‰ (6.8 ± 0.1 to 7.1 ± 0.2 mm total length [TL]; 3.0 ± 0.3 to 3.3 ± 0.3 mg wet weight) but larvae were 15% shorter at 45‰. Final swimbladder inflation and feeding onset of larvae was not affected by salinity in the range of 10-45‰. The presence of calculi in the urinary bladder of larvae was correlated positively with increasing salinity but no relationship between urinary calculi and larval survival was observed. In a second experiment, performance was assessed after transfer from 21°C at seven temperature treatments (15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33°C) in larvae from 3-21 dah. All larvae transferred from 21°C to 30°C and 33°C died after 3 days and from 21°C to 27°C died after 9 days. Survival was not significantly different between 15°C and 24°C. Larval growth increased as temperature was increased; larvae at 24°C (4.8 ± 0.2 mg wet weight) were 6-fold heavier than larvae at 15°C. Swimbladder inflation of larvae grown at 18°C, 21°C and 24°C was high (65.2 ± 18.0% to 86.7 ± 8.8%) and similar but inflation was lower in 15°C and 27°C. The incidence of urinary calculi occurred earlier and in a greater number of larvae when temperature was increased. Feeding onset was not affected by temperature. In a third experiment, performance was assessed at combinations of two salinities (20‰ and 35‰) and three temperatures (18°C, 21°C, and 24°C) in larvae from 3 to 24 dah. Survival of snapper larvae was not significantly different between these treatments. Growth was not affected by salinity but larvae increased in size as temperature was increased and there was no interaction of salinity and temperature. The percentage of larvae that commenced feeding and inflated their swimbladders was similar in all treatments. Salinity and temperature influenced the incidence of urinary calculi and there was an interaction between the parameters. Based on our results in terms of larval performance (growth), development and survival, we conclude that the optimal conditions for larval rearing of snapper from first-feeding (3 dah) to pre-metamorphosis (24 dah) are combinations of salinity from 20‰ to 35‰ and a temperature of 24°C. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Response surface methodology is a collection of statistical and mathematical techniques that are used to optimize the range of variables in various experimental processes to reduce the number of experimental runs, cost , and time, compared to other methods. Methods: Response surface methodology was applied for optimizing reflux extraction conditions for achieving high 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol contents, and high antioxidant activity in Zingiber officinale var. rubrum Theilade. The two-factor central composite design was employed to determine the effects of two independent variables, namely extraction temperature (X <inf> 1 </inf>:50-80°C) and time (X <inf> 2 </inf>:2-4h), on the properties of the extracts. The 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol contents were measured using ultra-performance liquid chromatography. The antioxidant activity of the rhizome extracts was determined by means of the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay. Anticancer activity of optimized extracts against HeLa cancer cell lines was measured using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. Results: Increasing the extraction temperature and time induced significant response of the variables. The optimum extraction condition for all responses was at 76.9°C for 3.4h. Under the optimum condition, the corresponding predicted response values for 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, and the antioxidant activity were 2.89mg/g DW, 1.85mg/g DW, and 84.3%, respectively. 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol were extracted under optimized condition to check the viability of the models. The values were 2.92 and 1.88mg/g DW, and 84.0% for 6-gingerol, 6-shogaol, and the antioxidant activity respectively. The experimental values agreed with those predicted, thus indicating suitability of the models employed and the success of RSM in optimizing the extraction condition. With optimizing of reflux extraction anticancer activity of extracts against HeLa cancer cells enhanced about 16.8%. The half inhibition concentration (IC<inf>50</inf>) value of optimized and unoptimized extract was found at concentration of 20.9 and 38.4μg/mL respectively. Optimized extract showed more distinct anticancer activities against HeLa cancer cells in a concentration of 40μg/mL (P<0.01) without toxicity to normal cells.

We used MODIS LAI (leaf area index) and GPP (gross primary production) deficits, the differences between actual and historical-maximum values, to describe vegetation structural and functional changes and consequential landcover change in response to changing climate conditions during 2001–2019 in the area (20° W–45° E, 20° N–45° N). We found that 1) the vegetation responses varied significantly among eight landcover types with the decreasing importance: forests, savannas, a mosaic of cropland and natural vegetation (CNV), croplands, permanent wetlands, urban land, grasslands, and shrublands, each with distinctive yet overlapping signatures over the ranges of the climate conditions considered. 2) Forests, occupying the coolest and wettest niche, showed the strongest response to severe drought with a lag of 1–3 years and a legacy effect for 10 years. Shrubs, occupying the hottest and driest niche, were the most resilient under a hotter and drier climate. 3) The total areas of savannas and CNV increased by 394,994 and 404,592 km<sup>2</sup>, respectively, while that of forests decreased by 33,091 km<sup>2</sup>. Shrublands extended by 287,134 km<sup>2</sup> while grasslands and croplands retreated by 490,644 and 225,263 km<sup>2</sup>. The area of wetlands increased by 49,192 km<sup>2</sup>, and that of urban land increased by 39,570 km<sup>2</sup>. A total of 57,649 km<sup>2</sup> of barren land became vegetated over the years. Along with higher temperature and more extended period of drought, MENA has evolved towards a shrubbier landscape. [11] Climate change predicts harsher summer droughts for mid-latitudes in Europe. To enhance our understanding of the putative impacts on forest regeneration, we studied the response of oak seedlings (Quercus petraea) to water deficit. Potted seedlings originating from three locally sourced provenances were subjected to two successive drought periods during the first growing season each followed by a plentiful rewatering. Here, we describe survival and phenological responses after the second drought treatment, applying general linear mixed modeling. From the 441 drought treated seedlings 189 subsisted with higher chances of survival among smaller plants and among single plants per pot compared to doubles. Remarkably, survival was independent of the provenance, although relatively more plants had died off in two provenances compared to the third one with mean plant height being higher in one provenance and standard deviation of plant height being higher in the other. Timing of leaf senescence was clearly delayed after the severe drought treatment followed by re-watering, with two seedlings per pot showing a lesser retardation compared to single plants. This delay can be interpreted as a compensation time in which plants recover before entering the subsequent developmental process of leaf senescence, although it renders seedlings more vulnerable to early autumn frosts because of the delayed hardening of the shoots. Onset of bud flush in the subsequent spring still showed a significant but small delay in the drought treated group, independent of the number of seedlings per pot, and can be considered as an after effect of the delayed senescence. In both phenological models significant differences among the three provenances were detected independent from the treatment. The only provenance that is believed to be local of origin, displayed the earliest leaf senescence and the latest flushing, suggesting an adaptation to the local maritime climate. This provenance also displayed the highest standard deviation of plant height, which can be interpreted as an adaptation to variable and unpredictable weather conditions, favoring smaller plants in drought-prone summers and higher plants in more normal growing seasons.",Unrelated and unverifiable

Medical images have been interpreted via computer tomography (CT), X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The barriers of medical image segmentation need to be resolved due to low contrast amongst the lesion, the surrounding tissue and blurred edges of the lesion. Labeling manually for hundreds of slices of organs or lesions has been quite time-consuming due to anatomy of the human body and shape of lesions. Manual labeling has intended to high subjective and low reproducibility. Doctors have been beneficial from a automatically locating, segmenting and quantifying lesions. Deep learning has been used widely in medical image processing. Deep learning-based U-Net has played a key role in the lesions segmentation. The encoding and decoding ways has made U-Net structures simply and symmetrically. Features extraction of medical images has been realized via convolution and down-sampling operations. The image segmentation mask via the transposed convolution and concatenation has been interpreted. A small-sized dataset has achieved qualified medical image segmentation. U-Net has been summarized and analyzed on the four aspects: the definition of U-Net, the upgrading of U-Net model, the setup of U-Net structure and the mechanism of U-Net. Four research areas have been proposed as below: 1) the basic structure and working principle of U-Net via convolution operation, down sampling, up sampling and concatenation. 2) U-Net network model have been demonstrated in three aspects in the context of the number of encoders, multiple U-Net cascades and other models combined with U-Net. U-Net based network have been divided into two, three and four encoders further in terms of the amount of encoders: Y-Net, Ψ-Net and multi-path dense U-Net. Multiple U-Nets cascade has been categorized into multiple U-Nets in series and multiple U-Nets in parallel based on the cascades mode of multiple U-Nets. In addition U-Net has improved the segmentation performance on the aspects of dual tree complex wavelet transform, local difference method, level set, random walk, graph cutting, CNNs(convolutional neural networks) and deep reinforcement learning. The upgrading of U-Net network structure have been divided into six subcategories including image augmentation, convolution operation, down-sampling operation, up-sampling operation, model optimization strategies and concatenation. Image enhancement has be divided into elastic deformation, geometric transformation, generative adversarial networks (GAN), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and real-time image enhancement further. The convolution operation has been improved via padding mode and convolution redesign. The padding mode mentioned has adapted constant padding, zero padding, replication padding and reflection padding and improvements to dilated convolution, inception module and asymmetric convolution. The down-sampling has been improved via max-pooling, average-pooling, stride convolution, dilated convolution, inception module and spatial pyramid pooling. Several up-sampling improvements have illustrated simultaneously via sub-pixel convolution, transposed convolution, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation. Model optimization strategies have been divided into two aspects in detail of activation function and normalization, the improvements of activation function includes rectified linear unit(ReLU), parametric ReLU(PReLU), random ReLU(RReLU), leaky ReLU(LReLU), hard exponential linear sigmoid squahing(HardELiSH) and exponential linear sigmoid squashing(ELiSH), and normalization method. The improvements have been to shown based on batch normalization, group normalization, instance normalization and layer normalization. The concatenation based improvement has been one of the future research area. The current concatenation improvements have been mainly realized via attention mechanism, new concatenation, feature reuse and de-convolution with activation function, annotation information fusion from Siamese network. The improved mechanisms in the U-Net network have been emphasized based on residual mechanism, dense mechanism, attention mechanism and the multi-mechanisms integration. The segmentation performance of the network can be enhanced. The further four research areas in U-Net have been illustrated as below: 1) the generalization of deep learning methods cannot be customized to fit the segmentation network for specific scenarios in the future. 2) Supervised deep learning models have required a lot of annotated images labeled for treatment. Unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models have been a vital research work further. 3) The low interpretability of U-Net network has lead the low acceptance in the mechanism of its operation.4) More accurate segmentation mask with fewer parameters has been obtained via good quality network structure. The precise manual segmentation has been so time-consuming and labor intensive. The simplified and quick semi-automatic segmentation has relied on the parameters and user-specified image preprocessing.

Many systems are connected each other in the world, and so the systems have to work 7 days 24 hours. Power failure of one system might affect many other systems. Many kinds of circuit have been proposed and adopted for UPS equipments. For important systems such as data center server facilities, double conversion UPS are used to offer the highest reliability of power supply. Recently the environmental protection has become much important and it is required to reduce power loss for all electrical equipments. This paper explains new control method to obtain the high efficiency double conversion UPS using conventional isolation type main circuit, and introduces the related test results. © 2007 IEEE.
[5]: The computer industry in Australia is investing on uninterruptible UPS power supply systems to overcome the power problems. The industry is investing in these power supply systems to overcome power problems related to electric overload in server rooms and data centers, that has increased with installation of data storage units. Capital and maintenance costs have increased significantly, forcing the industry to invest in uninterruptible UPS power supply systems. The industry is also focusing in computer equipment with low power electronics and low computer system loads. The 6-pulse UPS options are chosen with minimum specifications when operating with a generator. The Australian computer industry has relied on transformerless UPS designs with low loss choke filters that provide considerably better efficiency performance at full load conditions.",Unrelated and unverifiable

The act of not disclosing emissions information can lead to a further decrease in firm value, indicating that the market penalizes non-disclosure .","[2] We examine the roles of the outcome and process dimensions of environmental performance in determining financial performance as measured by Tobin's q. Outcomes refer to the impacts of the firm on the natural environment, while processes are the firm's actions to reduce these outcomes. We focus on a specific outcome - carbon emissions - and suggest that it affects Tobin's q non-linearly. We find that firms achieve the highest financial performance when their carbon performance is neither low nor high, but intermediate. We also find that environmental processes moderate this relationship as they reinforce firms' financial performance through improved stakeholder management. This mixed picture suggests that firms do not generally internalize the costs of poor carbon performance, but those that stand out in both environmental outcomes and processes achieve net financial benefits. These findings are based on a sample of carbon-intensive firms that disclosed their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Carbon Disclosure Project from 2007 through 2013. [17] Harnessing energy from the sunlight using solar photovoltaic trees (SPVTs) has become popular at present as they reduce land footprint and offer numerous complimentary services that offset infrastructure. The SPVT's complimentary services are noticeable in many ways, e.g., electric vehicle charging stations, landscaping, passenger shelters, onsite energy generated security poles, etc. Although the SPVT offers numerous benefits and services, its deployment is relatively slower due to the challenges it suffers. The most difficult challenges include the structure design, the photovoltaic (PV) cell technology selection for a leaf, and uncertainty in performance due to weather parameter variations. This paper aims to provide the most practical solution supported by the performance prioritization approach (PPA) framework for a typical multilayered SPVT. The proposed PPA framework considers the energy and sustainability indicators and helps in reporting the performance of a multilayered SPVT, with the aim of selecting an efficient PV leaf design. A three-layered SPVT (3-L SPVT) is simulated; moreover, the degradation-influenced lifetime energy performance and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions were evaluated for three different PV-cell technologies, namely crystalline silicon (c-Si), copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS), and cadmium telluride (CdTe). While evaluating the performance of the 3-L SPVT, the power conversion efficiency, thermal regulation, degradation rate, and lifecycle carbon emissions were considered. The results of the 3-L SPVT were analyzed thoroughly, and it was found that in the early years, the c-Si PV leaves give better energy yields. However, when degradation and other influencing weather parameters were considered over its lifetime, the SPVT with c-Si leaves showed a lowered energy yield. Overall, the lifetime energy and CO2 emission results indicate that the CdTe PV leaf outperforms due to its lower degradation rate compared to c-Si and CIGS. On the other side, the benefits associated with CdTe cells, such as flexible and ultrathin glass structure as well as low-cost manufacturing, make them the best acceptable PV leaf for SPVT design. Through this investigation, we present the selection of suitable solar cell technology for a PV leaf.",Unrelated and unverifiable

In this work, we present an easy method to produce wires using only commercially available materials. A consumer grade inkjet printer was used to print a wire of silver nanoparticles with a sheet resistance below 1 ω/sq. on a non-pre-strained sheet of elastic silicone. This wire was stretched more than 10,000 times and was still conductive afterwards. The viscoelastic behavior of the substrate results in a temporarily increased resistance that decreases to almost the original value. After over-stretching, the wire is conductive within less than a second. We analyze the swelling of the silicone due to the ink's solvent and the nanoparticle film on top by microscope and SEM images. Finally, a 60 mm long stretchable conductor was integrated onto wearables, and showed that it can bear strains of up to 300% and recover to a conductivity that allows the operation of an assembled LED assembled at only 1.8 V.

If effective, the increased soil carbon and nutrient status may result in increased aboveground tree growth. Eight years after study installation, the impact of forest slash incorporation into the soil on soil carbon and nutrient stocks, foliar nutrients and loblolly pine growth are examined on mineral and organic sites on the North Carolina Lower Coastal Plain. Treatments include leaving forest slash on the surface and flat planting (control); V-shear and bedding (conventional), mulch forest slash followed by bedding (strip mulch) and mulch forest slash and till into the soil followed by bedding (strip mulch till). After eight years, mulching and/or tillage did not have a significant impact (p > 0.05) on soil bulk density or soil chemical properties (pH, cation exchange capacity, soil nutrients). Additionally, neither tree foliar nutrients nor stand volume were significantly impacted. However, significant effects were observed for soil phosphorus contents and stand volume between the control plots and the other treatment plots. For example, the mean stand volumes on the mineral site were 24.49 ± 1.28, 38.16 ± 2.90, 44.59 ± 3.07 and 46.96 ± 2.74 m<sup>3</sup> ha<sup>-1</sup> for the control, conventional, strip mulch and strip mulch till plots. These observations are more likely due to the effect of bedding rather than mulching or tillage of the forest slash. These results are consistent for the mineral and the organic sites. Considering the greater expense to install the mulch and tillage treatments, the lack of a treatment effect on soil carbon and nutrient stocks and tree growth does not justify these treatments on these sites. [17] Bischofia javanica is a non-native tree species in Japan's Ogasawara Islands, where it threatens native tree species due to its rapid propagation and growth. An effective method is needed to limit the expansion of B. javanica populations and to conserve the natural forest ecosystem of the islands. For this purpose, we examined the effectiveness of a new application technique for the herbicide glyphosate on B. javanica. In this method, glyphosate solution is directly injected into holes drilled in the stem, and each hole is then plugged with a cork stopper to prevent loss of the solution, namely the drill-and-plug method. We also developed an allometric regression model linking stem diameter with total aboveground biomass (AGB) to estimate the necessary herbicide dosage. Our results suggest that between 0.1 and 0.5 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (active ingredient per unit AGB) is required to control most B. javanica trees. Verification of the drill-and-plug method using the minimum dosage (0.1 g kg<sup>−1</sup>) showed that most of the herbicide-treated trees were killed.

However, their performance can be affected by temperature and state of charge, impacting power capability and energy efficiency .","For vehicle electrical systems, high-power optimized lithium-ion batteries offer superior cycle stability, compactness and weight compared to conventional lead–acid batteries. To identify lithium-ion cell candidates during early concept and development phases, both performance characteristics and a comparison of commercialized lithium-ion cells covering different cell chemistries are needed. Since the market share of high-power lithium ion cells is limited, scientific studies and extensive characterizations are rare. This study closes the gap by benchmarking state-of-the-art high-power cells considering the requirements of 12V/48V applications. The sensible begin-of-life parameters OCV, internal resistance, and capacity were investigated by stepwise OCV measurement, pulse power characterization and capacity measurement regarding the dimensions: SOC (0% to 100%), temperature (−25°C to +55°C) and current rate (up to 30C). All cells exhibit temperature dependent OCV curves, with ambient temperatures above zero hardly affecting the OCV hysteresis. A SOC dependency of the internal resistance of the tested lithium titanate oxide cell reduces the power capability, available cell capacity and energy efficiency. This cell, in contrast to the graphite-based cells, enables a neglection of a Butler–Volmer dependency and offers high charge acceptance at negative temperatures. The internal resistance of the lithium iron phosphate cell is less affected by SOC which allows for constant power output. Above 25°C and up to 15C, energy efficiencies of the graphite-based cells exceed 95%. We conclude that the lithium iron phosphate cell is best suited for 12V applications due to its voltage band and discharge characteristics. None of the cells stand out for use in 48V applications.

Thus, effective interventions to reduce stroke impact on the family are needed. Objectives: To evaluate the content validity and satisfaction of a caregiver-focused web-based intervention designed to improve stroke survivor physical function while reducing caregiver negative outcomes. Methods: Caregivers of individuals with stroke (N = 6) and expert rehabilitation researchers (N = 4) were presented with a novel, web-based intervention (CARE-CITE) designed to foster problem-solving and skill-building while facilitating caregiver involvement during constraint-induced movement therapy. Caregivers rated CARE-CITE for usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, and time to complete. Rehabilitation experts evaluated content for accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, problem relevance and ease of use. Ratings were assessed using a five-point Likert-type response scales (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Results: On average, all caregivers agreed or strongly agreed that the modules were useful (4.42), easy to use (4.60), and acceptable (4.41).

Currently a pilot study is underway to evaluate the impact of the intervention on caregiver mental health, family conflict around stroke recovery and stroke survivor upper extremity function. [7] As the older adult population continues to grow, the prevalence of chronic diseases is also increasing, leading to the need for novel ways of managing this large population of patients. One solution is to focus on informal caregivers. These informal caregivers already make a substantial contribution to our nation's healthcare finances and patient health outcomes. Caregivers also derive benefits from caring for their family member or friend; however, it is not uncommon for these individuals to experience negative health consequences, or what is often called ""burden of care."" Those called to care are not without their own burdens, and they must frequently make significant lifestyle adjustments that impact their own health.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of Stroke Riskometer Application (SRA™) on promoting healthier lifestyles among familial stroke caregivers for primary prevention. Methods: A parallel, open-label, 2-arm prospective, pilot randomised controlled trial was conducted at a long-term stroke service at a university based primary care clinic. All stroke caregivers aged ≥ 18 years, proficient in English or Malay and smartphone operation were invited. From 147 eligible caregivers, 76 participants were randomised to either SRA™ intervention or conventional care group (CCG) after receiving standard health counselling. The intervention group had additional SRA™ installed on their smartphones, which enabled self-monitoring of modifiable and non-modifiable stroke risk factors. The Stroke Riskometer app (SRA<sup>TM</sup>) and Life's Simple 7 (LS7) questionnaires assessed stroke risk and lifestyle practices. Changes in clinical profile, lifestyle practices and calculated stroke risk were analysed at baseline and 3 months.

Results: The demographic and clinical characteristics of the intervention and control group study participants were comparable. Better improvement in LS7 scores were noted in the SRA™ arm compared to CCG at 3 months: Median difference (95% CI) = 0.88 (1.68–0.08), p = 0.03. However, both groups did not show significant changes in median stroke risk and relative risk scores at 5-, 10-years (Stroke risk 5-years: Median difference (95% CI) = 0.53 (0.15–1.21), p = 0.13, 10-years: Median difference (95% CI) = 0.81 (0.53–2.15), p = 0.23; Relative risk 5-years: Median difference (95% CI) = 0.84 (0.29–1.97), p = 0.14, Relative risk 10-years: Median difference (95% CI) = 0.58 (0.36–1.52), p = 0.23).

Recently, sponges have attracted a high interest from scientific community because two important factors. First there is the fact that sponges have a wide range of associated bacteria; and, second, they are a rich source of bioactive substances. Since 1950, a number of bioactive substances with various pharmacological functions have been isolated from marine sponges. However, many of these substances were subsequently shown to be actually synthesized by sponge-associated bacteria. Bacteria associated with marine sponges constitute an interesting source of novel bioactive compounds with biotechnological potential such as antimicrobial substances, enzymes and surfactants. In addition, these bacteria may be biofilm forming and can act as bioindicators in bioremediation processes of environmental pollution caused by oil and heavy metals.

[5]: Sponges belonging to genus Mycale are common and widely distributed across the oceans and represent a significant component of benthic communities in term of their biomass, which in many species is largely composed by bacteria. However, the microbial communities associated with Mycale species inhabiting different geographical areas have not been previously compared. Here, we provide the first detailed description of the microbiota of two Mycale species inhabiting the sub-Antarctic Magellan region (53°S) and the Western Antarctic Peninsula (62-64°S), two geographically distant areas (> 1,300 km) with contrasting environmental conditions. The sponges Mycale (Aegogropila) magellanica and Mycale (Oxymycale) acerata are both abundant members of benthic communities in the Magellan region and in Antarctica, respectively. High throughput sequencing revealed a remarkable similarity in the microbiota of both sponge species, dominated by Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, with both species sharing more than 74% of the OTUs. In contrast, 16% and 10% of the OTUs were found only in either M. magellanica or M. acerata, respectively. Interestingly, despite slight differences in the relative abundance, the most dominant OTUs were present in both species, whereas the unique OTUs had very low abundances (less than 1% of the total abundance). These results show a significant overlap among the microbiota of both Mycale species and also suggest the existence of a low level of specificity of the most dominant symbiont groups.",Missing information

Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.
[4]: China's grain basket in the North China Plain is threatened by increasing water scarcity and there is an urgent need to develop water-saving irrigation strategies. Water savings in rice can be realized by alternate wetting and drying (AWD) under lowland conditions, or by aerobic rice in which the crop is grown under nonflooded conditions with supplemental irrigation. Field experimentation and simulation modelling are a powerful combination to understand complex crop-water interactions and to extrapolate site-specific empirical results to other environments and conditions. In this paper, we present results from 4 years of field experiments on AWD and aerobic rice in 2001-2004 near Kaifeng, Henan Province, China. The experimental data were used to parameterize and evaluate the rice growth model ORYZA2000. A subsequent paper reports on the extrapolation of the experimental results using ORYZA2000 and on farmer-participatory testing of aerobic rice. In the lowland area of the study site, rice yields under flooded conditions were around 8000 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> with 900 mm total (rain, irrigation) water input. Irrigation water savings were 40-70% without any yield loss by applying AWD. In the upland area of the study site, aerobic rice yielded 2400-3600 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, using 750-1100 mm total water input. ORYZA2000 satisfactorily reproduced the dynamics in measured crop variables (biomass, leaf area, N uptake) and soil water variables (ponded water depth, soil water tension). The root mean square error of predicted yield was 11% for lowland rice and 19% for aerobic rice, which was only one and a half times the error in the measured values. We concluded that ORYZA2000 is sufficiently accurate to extrapolate our results on AWD and aerobic rice to different management and environmental conditions in our study area. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

During the wet season, old fields and agricultural fields were selected, but seasonally flooded old fields and managed openings were not. Within home ranges (3<sup>rd</sup>-order selection), hogs selected old fields and managed openings during the dry season. All habitats were used randomly within home ranges during the wet season.

Projections and expectations for future UAS utilization span a very wide and diverse spectrum of civilian and public domain applications, in addition to the obvious military applications, from emergency response, to environmental monitoring, early fire detection and forest protection, to name but a few such applications.

i_2096,Unverifiable,"Inference on Splenosomatic Index (SSI): Aggression and SSI: While none of the abstracts directly measure SSI, the evidence suggests that aggression and social stress can lead to increased metabolic rates, higher energy expenditure, and physiological stress . These factors could potentially lead to changes in organ sizes, including the spleen, which is involved in immune responses and stress regulation. Given that chronic stress and high energy expenditure can affect organ sizes and physiological functions, it is plausible that increased aggression among trout could lead to a reduction in their SSI due to the physiological costs associated with aggressive interactions and stress.","The deleterious effect of competition for space and food in animals increases with increasing population density. In contrast, familiarity towards conspecifics can relax the intensity of interference competition. Here, we hypothesized that familiarity towards conspecifics mitigates the effect of density-dependent growth and dispersal behaviour in territorial animals. To test this, wild-captured juvenile brown trout were subjected to two consecutive laboratory experiments. First, growth and fin erosion were measured for 40 d in a 2 × 2 factorial design manipulating density and familiarity. The density was manipulated via size of experimental tanks, while per capita food abundance and fish number was constant. All fish were subsequently exposed to an emergence test, giving them the option to leave their group and disperse to a novel unoccupied environment. The results show that familiarity increases growth and decreases the level of fin erosion (i.e. proxy of intensity of aggressive interactions). We found no significant effect of population density on growth rate. However, there was a tendency towards higher fin erosion in fish kept under high density. The growth of individuals was also affected by their size rank within the group, with the largest individuals in each group growing disproportionally faster than the rest of the group, probably due to their high social rank. However, the second and third fish in the size rank did not grow significantly faster and tended to suffer higher mortality than the rest of the group. During the emergence test, the largest individuals in the familiar groups left the shelter either as the first (six of 12 groups) or last (five of 12 groups) individual in the group, while no such pattern was observed in unfamiliar groups. Our results suggest that individuals in familiar groups receive less aggression and stress (i.e. fin damage) and grow faster than fish in unfamiliar groups. The mechanisms indicated in this laboratory study may be especially important in highly fecund organisms like fish which undergo density-dependent bottlenecks during early life.
[2]: In animals, behavioural properties such as aggressive propensity are often consistent over a life span, and they may form part of a behavioural syndrome. We studied how aggressive propensity influences dominance, contest behaviour and growth in the cooperatively breeding cichlid fish Neolamprologus pulcher. We tested whether intrinsic aggressive propensity (1) influences dominance in paired contests, (2) causes different aggression levels in contests with partners matched for aggressive propensity compared to unmatched partners, and how it (3) affects growth rate in groups that were either matched or unmatched for aggressive propensity. Intrinsic aggressive propensity was first scored with a mirror test and classified as high, medium or low. Thereafter we tested fish with either high or low aggressive propensity with partners matched for size and either matched or unmatched for aggressive type in a paired contest for a shelter. We scored dominance, aggression and submission. As predicted, (1) dominance was more clearly established in unmatched than in matched contests and (2) individuals with high aggressive propensity launched more attacks overall than fish with low intrinsic aggressiveness, suggesting a higher propensity to escalate independently of winning or losing the paired contest. However, contrary to expectation, (3) individuals with low aggressiveness grew faster than aggressive ones in unmatched groups, whereas the opposite occurred in matched groups. This suggests that individuals with low aggressive propensity may benefit from conflict evasion, which might allow them to gain dominance in the future owing to larger body size. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.
[3]: The objective of the present investigation was to determine whether chronic increases in circulating cortisol concentrations, resulting from the occupation of subordinate status in rainbow trout social hierarchies, resulted in an enhancement of the erythrocyte adrenergic response. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) were confined in fork length matched pairs for 6 h, 18 h, 48 h or 5-7 days, and social status was assigned through observations of behaviour. Erythrocyte adrenergic responsiveness, determined in vitro as changes in water content following incubation with the β-adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol, was significantly greater in subordinate than dominant fish at 48 h of social interactions but not after 5-7 days, nor when assessed as changes in extracellular pH (pHe). However, the activity of the Na<sup>+</sup>/H <sup>+</sup> exchanger (β-NHE), assessed in vitro as the pHe change following incubation with the permeable cyclic AMP analogue 8-bromo-cyclic AMP, was significantly lower in subordinate fish. The number of erythrocyte membrane-bound adrenergic receptors (B<inf>max</inf>) was significantly higher in subordinate than dominant fish at 48 h, but had decreased by 5-7 days to a value that was not significantly different from that for dominant fish. The apparent dissociation constant (K<inf>D</inf>) of these receptors was not significantly impacted by either social status or interaction time. Finally, the relative expressions of β-3<inf>b</inf> adrenergic receptor (AR) and β-NHE mRNA were determined using real-time PCR and were found to be minimally affected by social rank. Relative to a control group, β-3 <inf>b</inf> AR mRNA was significantly up-regulated in both dominant and subordinate trout at all time periods, whereas the expression of β-NHE was in general significantly down-regulated. Unlike the situation in rainbow trout treated with exogenous cortisol, elevations in circulating cortisol resulting from low social status did not ""pre-adapt"" the erythrocyte adrenergic response, but rather may have served to offset the potentially adverse effects elicited by plasma catecholamines, which were elevated during social hierarchy formation. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

[4]: The timing with which salmonid larvae emerge from their gravel nests is thought to be correlated with a particular suite of behavioural and physiological traits that correspond to the stress coping style of the individual. Among these traits, aggressiveness, dominance and resilience to stress, are potentially interesting to exploit in aquaculture production. In the present study a series of experiments were performed, with the purpose of characterising behavioural, metabolic and production related traits in rainbow trout juveniles from different emergence fractions. Newly hatched rainbow trout were sorted according to their emergence time from an artificial redd. The early, middle, and late fractions were retained and assessed for their physiological response to stress, growth performance, metabolism, fasting tolerance, and potential for compensatory growth. The early emerging fraction showed proactive behavioural traits; they were faster to reappear following startling, showed a reduced cortisol response following stress, and a reduced metabolic cost of recovery. Emergence time was not correlated with any differences in standard or maximum metabolic rates, but was however, correlated with higher routine metabolic rates, as demonstrated by significantly bigger weight losses during fasting in the early emerging group. Growth rates and feed conversion efficiencies were not significantly different when fish were co-habitated under a restrictive feeding regime, suggesting that early emerging fish are not able to monopolise food resources. The intermediate emerging group, which makes up the bulk of a population and is often ignored, appears to possess the best growth performance traits, possibly because they do not expend excessive energy on dominance behaviour such as the early emerging group, while they are also not overly timid or stress prone such as the late emerging group.",Unrelated and unverifiable

However, differences in carbon footprints between different schemes have been largely ignored when comparing environmental impacts for decision making. Thus, this paper aims to study and compare the carbon footprints of two types of Nuozhadu hydropower schemes with the same scale: an earth-core rockfill dam (ECRD) and a concrete gravity dam (CGD). The hybrid life cycle assessment (LCA) method combines the completeness of economic input-output LCA (EIO-LCA) and the specificity of process-based LCA (PA-LCA). It was applied to quantify the carbon footprint over the whole life cycle of the hydropower system. The evaluation of the carbon footprint considered the emissions from material production, transportation, construction, and the operation and maintenance phases for a period of 44 years. All relevant materials and energy consumption were included. It was found that the ECRD reduced CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by approximately 24.7% compared to the CGD. With respect to each stage of the life cycle, the ECRD decreased CO<inf>2</inf> emissions by 46.1% for material production, 16.5% for transportation and 9.0% for operation and maintenance but increased emissions by 6.6% for construction due to the heavy workload. Operational maintenance was the greatest contributor to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions, followed by the production, construction and transportation stages. These results indicate that ECRDs are more environmentally responsible throughout its life cycle.

However, wearability, biocompatibility, environmental friendliness and scalability have become new limitations. Self-healing ability can improve the long-term robustness and reliability of e-skins. However, self-healing ability and integration are hardly balanced in classical structures of self-healable devices. Here, cellulose nanofiber/poly(vinyl alcohol) (CNF/PVA), a biocompatible moisture-inspired self-healable composite, was applied both as the binder in functional layers and the substrate. Various functional layers comprising particular carbon materials and CNF/PVA were patterned on the substrate. A planar structure was beneficial for integration, and the active self-healing ability of the functional layers endowed self-healed e-skins with a higher toughness. Water served as both the only solvent throughout the fabrication process and the trigger of the self-healing process, which avoids the pollution and bioincompatibility caused by the application of noxious additives. Our e-skins could achieve real-time monitoring of whole-body physiological signals and environmental temperature and humidity. Cross-interference between different external stimuli was suppressed through reasonable material selection and structural design. Combined with conventional electronics, data could be transmitted to a nearby smartphone for post-processing. This work provides a previously unexplored strategy for multifunctional e-skins with an excellent practicality.[Figure not available: see fulltext.].",Missing information

Advanced techniques such as integrating an atomic force microscope (AFM) can help monitor and measure tool wear in real-time, ensuring consistent precision .","Micro milling is a micromachining process to manufacture miniaturized components and microstructured surfaces. However, micro milling is limited by high abrasive wear of the tools. Especially for tools with a diameter smaller than 100 µm this cannot be avoided, as the cutting edge radius cannot be further reduced; when using cemented carbide as substrate for micro end mills the cutting edge radius is in the range of the grain size (≈200 nm). Here, the characterization of the cutting edge radius and the cutting edge microstructure is not possible using optical imaging techniques due to the limited lateral resolution of these systems. Additionally, intermittent off machine measurements are not possible in this order of magnitude of the tools during machining to characterize progressive tool wear, as reclamping results in significant errors: The reclamping process would influence the tool spindle system, e. g. by introducing a change in the runout and the Z offset.

The measuring possibilities, the established workflows and measurement results are presented. With the AFM, it is possible to measure tools immediately after their manufacture with respect to their macro and micro geometry. Furthermore, tools can be manufactured, applied to produce micro structures and the tool wear can be measured process intermittent without the need to unclamp and reclamp the tool. This enables the characterization of the progressive tool wear and its influence on machining.

i_1072,Contradiction,"Key Points: Production and Lifespan: RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and have a lifespan of about 150 days. The body can increase RBC production in response to conditions like anoxia, hemorrhage, or high altitudes .","This chapter will address the special properties of the red blood cells in promoting oxygen carriage, the methods of safe blood and blood component transfusion and consideration of the hazards of these procedures. THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BLOOD The vascular system and the blood which flows within it can be regarded as the communication and nutrient highway of the body. Blood consists of a fluid phase, plasma, and cells of the haematopoietic system (e.g. red blood cells, leucocytes and their precursors). Plasma contains numerous elements, chemical messengers and protective proteins, including coagulation factors. The cellular part of the blood consists of red blood cells, which are discussed in more detail below, platelets, which are essential for normal haemostasis, and white blood cells, which are the travelling immune system responsible for host defence. RED BLOOD CELLS Haemoglobin is packaged into red blood cells, which normally have a lifespan of 120 days. During this time they probably travel about 300 miles and must be sufficiently deformable to pass repeatedly through the microcirculation where the vessels are less than half the red cell diameter. The special properties of the red cell skeleton (forming a biconcave disc) and metabolic pathways are crucial to these features and any disturbance of these, such as inherited or acquired structural abnormalities (e.g. spherocytosis) or enzyme defects, is likely to adversely affect function and therefore oxygen carrying capacity. One of the key functions of blood is the transport of oxygen (mainly by the haemoglobin in the red cells) to the tissues and removal of carbon dioxide from them. Red blood cells are produced in the bone marrow, originating from pluripotent stem cells, and are released in a carefully controlled manner so that the production of new red cells (about 2 X 1011 per day) balances the rate of destruction. The rate of production can be increased considerably (up to about eight times the normal rate) and occurs when demand is increased as a consequence of anoxia, haemorrhage, haemolysis or at increased altitudes. Red cell production is controlled by many factors such as the supply of essential constituents and cofactors (including iron, B12 and folate), specific hormones and cytokines, erythropoietin in particular, and others such as growth hormone, thyroxin, corticosteroids and androgens. Erythropoietin is produced mainly in the kidneys, with some produced in the liver, and it enhances red cell production in response to tissue anoxia.",Numeric error
i_1720,Contradiction,"Timely maintenance can help maintain smoother pavement surfaces, reducing noise pollution and improving air quality around airports .","Both the design and the construction of airfield pavements have to be consistent with strict requirements and constraints and also higher safety standards due to their particular setting. In addition, maintenance and construction times must be minimized in order to avoid delays and limitations on airport capacity. Maintaining or constructing airfield pavements also entails working during all-weather conditions (e.g. winter time and heavy cold conditions); materials adopted therefore play a major role in the success of the maintenance or construction activity. Environmental management plans and eco-friendly policies and strategies are increasingly being adopted by airport directors. Noise reduction plans through improved air traffic management techniques, emissions control for aircraft engines and ground maneuvering vehicles, reuse of water for washing airfield pavements, use of renewable energies, and use of photocatalytic materials are only some of the numerous ways of achieving a sustainable airport. The paper focuses on construction techniques and the development of innovative materials for the achievement of environmental sustainability on airfield pavements. In particular, the authors present how a long lasting and well performing airport pavement can be built if more than 85% of the materials used are recycled materials. The environmental analysis of a case study on a major Italian airport shows that the release of almost 35% of emissions could be avoided if recycling practices are taken into account. Furthermore, pavement performance is analyzed and monitored as well in order to show that recycling does not necessarily result in lower performance. Outcomes clearly suggest that the recycled airport pavement has a comparable performance and less of an environmental impact on standard airfield pavements. Moreover, results can be implemented into an Airport Pavement Management System to assess the best strategy, considering the environmental footprint in addition to the traditional performance analysis and cost effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
