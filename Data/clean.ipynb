Various aspects of possible regulatory frameworks for its implementation are beginning to be discussed in Europe. One of the issues associated with the wide use of CCS is that it requires the establishment of a carbon dioxide (CO &lt;inf&gt;2&lt;/inf&gt;) transport network, which could result in the spatial restructuring of power generation and transmission systems. This poses a significant coordination problem necessitating public planning and regulation. This paper provides a survey over multiple research strands on CCS, particularly energy system modeling and spatial optimization, pertaining to the efficient installment of CCS-related infrastructure throughout Europe. It integrates existing findings and highlights the factors that determine policy coordination needs for a potential wide implementation of CCS in the next decades. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.</td>\n",

       "      <td>[6]: Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, where two-thirds of the rural community depend on agriculture for their employment. Sustainable agriculture, with its ability to remain productive in the long term, may help ensure food security for communities in India. This article attempts to examine agricultural sustainability among farming communities in Vaishali, India. In order to evaluate agricultural sustainability, we followed the sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) approach, which is characterized by three interacting components indices (ecological security, economic efficiency, and social equity). We collected data concerning the domains of agricultural sustainability from 959 farmers' households. The analysis revealed that agricultural sustainability among the farmers decreased as the size of land holdings decreased. Nearly one-third of the total sampled farmers had low agricultural sustainability. Regression analysis showed that economic efficiency and social equity influenced the agricultural sustainability. The SLSI approach helped to identify priorities for attaining farmers' agricultural sustainability.</td>\n",

The reference [6], however, describes three components of the SLSI approach: ecological security, economic efficiency, and social equity. It also says that both economic efficiency and social equity influence sustainability. Since the reference omits a possible interpretation that social equity alone could drive sustainability, it fails to include the critical information needed to support the claim entirely.\\nJustification 2: The claim is inaccurate because it isolates social equity as the sole determinant of agricultural sustainability. Whereas, the reference indicate more complex interaction of factors within the SLS framework.</td>\n",

Fermentation made the musts less brown and more yellow, whereas ageing made them darker and increased their brown, reddish and yellowish hues. Overall, the musts fermented to 8% vol ethanol exhibited higher odour activity values (OAVs). In addition, the musts aged with oak chips were slightly different from those without chips. Expert tasters gave the highest scores to the musts fermented to 8% (v/v) ethanol with 2 g/L of oak chips added.

The use of smaller quantities of construction materials, materials of higher quality and durability, and recycling of construction waste are all requirements of today's aspiration for a circular economy, but it is necessary to assess their environmental and economic sustainability. This paper presents a review of the current assessment tools of circular economy projects applied to the construction industry, such as LCA, LCC and CBA. The main objectives of this study were to provide a categorization of CE concepts applied in the construction industry (CI) and to review assessment methods used for evaluating CE projects in CI. This paper selected and reviewed 96 published papers and classified them into one of five aspects of CE highlighted in this study: waste management, reducing the impact on the environment, material &amp; product design, building design, and other. The results showed that the use of assessment methods in CE projects has increased in the recent years as well that an LCA was by far the most used assessment method and waste management the most common aspect of CE in CI.</td>\n",

The purpose of these measurements is to locate and identify noise sources on a production line in a complicated acoustic situation (reverberation conditions, many and various noise sources). The results of these measurements are used as an input in computer simulations with software for noise prediction which leads to creation of noise sources ranking and finding possibilities to reduce the noise level.

Various aspects of possible regulatory frameworks for its implementation are beginning to be discussed in Europe. One of the issues associated with the wide use of CCS is that it requires the establishment of a carbon dioxide (CO <inf>2</inf>) transport network, which could result in the spatial restructuring of power generation and transmission systems. This poses a significant coordination problem necessitating public planning and regulation. This paper provides a survey over multiple research strands on CCS, particularly energy system modeling and spatial optimization, pertaining to the efficient installment of CCS-related infrastructure throughout Europe. It integrates existing findings and highlights the factors that determine policy coordination needs for a potential wide implementation of CCS in the next decades. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.   \n",

This article attempts to examine agricultural sustainability among farming communities in Vaishali, India. In order to evaluate agricultural sustainability, we followed the sustainable livelihood security index (SLSI) approach, which is characterized by three interacting components indices (ecological security, economic efficiency, and social equity). We collected data concerning the domains of agricultural sustainability from 959 farmers' households. The analysis revealed that agricultural sustainability among the farmers decreased as the size of land holdings decreased. Nearly one-third of the total sampled farmers had low agricultural sustainability. Regression analysis showed that economic efficiency and social equity influenced the agricultural sustainability. The SLSI approach helped to identify priorities for attaining farmers' agricultural sustainability.   \n",

Emergency managers must facilitate the incorporation of these lessons into the culture of tourist business managers.   \n",
