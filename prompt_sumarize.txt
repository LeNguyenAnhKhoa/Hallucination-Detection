You are an annotator concerned that the claim may not align with the reference. Your task is to determine whether the reference entail, contradict, or is unverifiable to the claim.
You will be given two inputs: claim, reference.
    You are asked to evaluate the generated text looking at the input text and the target text.
    A reference entails a claim if the information in the reference directly supports the claim being true and there is no conflicting information. The information logically leads to the claim being correct. A reference contradicts a claim if it provides information that directly disproves or disagrees with any part of the claim. This includes stating different entities, numeric values, or relations compared to the claim. A reference is unverifiable to a claim if it does not provide enough information to determine whether the claim is true or false. This happens if the reference is unrelated, missing key details, or too ambiguous.
    Example:
    ##
    claim: 8. X-ray Techniques: X-ray Absorption and Diffraction: Methods like extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray diffraction, and low-angle scattering are used to gain and analyze experimental data for material examination .
    reference: Ways to gain and analyze experimental data obtained by X-ray techniques used in material examination are described. Emphasis is on the methods of extended X-ray absorption fine structure, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray low-angle scattering.
    answer: Entailment
    ##
    claim: ### Machine Condition Monitoring - **Predictive Maintenance**: ML algorithms are not effective in predicting future damages in technical machines, such as turbines and pumps, as they fail to accurately model and extrapolate damage mechanisms based on sensor data.
    reference: Many technical machines are instrumented. Temperatures, pressures, flow rates, vibrations and so on are measured and centrally archived. These data can be used to reliably predict future damages several days in advance. A self-learning mathematical method is used to do this, which models the machine and can extrapolate the damage mechanism into the future. Examples include turbines, pumps and catalytic reactors that will be treated in this paper.
    answer: Contradiction
    ##
    claim: Ensuring that chatbots can handle a wide range of queries and provide accurate, relevant information is crucial for their effectiveness .
    reference:  In this paper we learn how to manage a dialogue relying on discourse of its utterances. We define extended discourse trees, introduce means to manipulate with them, and outline scenarios of multi-document navigation to extend the abilities of the interactive information retrieval-based chat bot. We also provide evaluation results of the comparison between conventional search and chat bot enriched with the multi-document navigation.

    Input:
claim: Definition and Prevalence: Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, accounting for a significant portion of pediatric brain tumors .
reference: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common pediatric brain tumor and a primary cause of cancer-related death in children. Until a few years ago, only clinical and histological features were exploited for MB pathological classification and outcome prognosis. In the past decade, the advancement of high-throughput molecular analyses that integrate genetic, epigenetic, and expression data, together with the availability of increasing wealth of patient samples, revealed the existence of four molecularly distinct MB subgroups. Their further classification into 12 subtypes not only reduced the well-characterized intertumoral heterogeneity, but also provided new opportunities for the design of targets for precision oncology. Moreover, the identification of tumorigenic and self-renewing subpopulations of cancer stem cells in MB has increased our knowledge of its biology. Despite these advancements, the origin of MB is still debated, and its molecular bases are poorly characterized. A major goal in the field is to identify the key genes that drive tumor growth and the mechanisms through which they are able to promote tumorigenesis. So far, only protein-coding genes acting as oncogenic drivers have been characterized in each MB subgroup. The contribution of the non-coding side of the genome, which produces a plethora of transcripts that control fundamental biological processes, as the cell choice between proliferation and differentiation, is still unappreciated. This review wants to fill this major gap by summarizing the recent findings on the impact of non-coding RNAs in MB initiation and progression. Furthermore, their potential role as specific MB biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets is also highlighted.\n[2]: Medulloblastoma is the most common primary central nervous system tumor of childhood. Medulloblastoma can metastasize along the neuraxis and to extraneural locations, but multiple intramedullary spinal metastases are very rare. The usual presenting clinical features are related to posterior fossa syndrome and/or hydrocephalus. We describe a unique case of medulloblastoma with multiple intramedullary lesions at the D-7 and D-12 levels.\n[3]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Currently, »one-size-fits-all» radiation and chemotherapy treatment regimen is employed for treating MB patient, causing at least some children to undergo highly aggressive and in some cases, inadequate radiation therapy. Consequently, there is a need for prognostic and predictive tools for identifying disease aggressiveness and ultimately which patients with MB may be able to benefit from de-escalation of therapy. Genomic characterization of MB has recently identified 4 distinct molecular subgroups: Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), Wingless (WNT), Group 3, Group 4 each exhibiting different clinical behavior. The molecular sub-types have unique risk-profiles and outcomes, and patients could potentially benefit from sub-group specific treatments. However, the transition of these molecular MB subtypes into clinical practice has been limited due to challenges in availability of molecular profiling in most hospitals, as well as variability in clinical assessment. In this work, we present a radiomic feature that captures subtle tissue deformations caused due to the impact of tumor growth on the normal-appearing brain around tumor (BAT), to distinguish molecular sub-types of MB. First, we obtain voxel-wise deformation magnitude from the deformation orientations, after registering Gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced T1-w MRI scan for every study to a normal age-specific T1w MRI template. Deformation statistics are then computed within every 5mm annular BAT region, 0 < d < 60mm, where d is the distance from the tumor infiltrating edge, to capture subtle localized deformation changes around the tumor. Our results using multi-class comparison via one-way ANOVA and post-hoc comparison showed significant differences across deformation magnitudes obtained for Group 3, Group 4, and SHH molecular sub-types, observed up to 15-mm outside the infiltrating edge. Our feasibility results suggest that the subtle deformation features in BAT observed on routine Gd-T1w MRI may potentially serve as surrogate markers to non-invasively characterize molecular sub-types of pediatric MB.\n[4]: Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in children. Although multimodality treatment regimens including surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy have greatly improved disease outcome, about one-third of MB patient remains incurable, and many long-term survivors are suffered from deleterious effects due to aggressive treatment. Understanding the signaling pathways and the genetic mechanisms contributed to MB development would be the key to develop novel therapeutic treatment strategies for improving survival and outcome of MB. In this review, we discuss the biological signaling pathways involved in MB pathogenesis. We also go through the current international consensus of four core MB subgroups namely, SHH, WNT, Group 3, and Group 4. This is adopted based on the knowledge of genomic complexity of MB as analyzed by recent high-throughput genomic technology. We talk about immunohistochemistry assays established to determine molecular subgroup affiliation. In the last part of review, we discuss how identification of molecular subgroups is going to change our routine disease diagnosis and clinical management.
