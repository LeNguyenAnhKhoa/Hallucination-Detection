# A.M.P at SciHal2025: Automated Hallucination Detection in Scientific Content via LLMs and Prompt Engineering

This repository provides the code for the A.M.P system for the SDP share task.

## Task: SciHal2025

- SciHal stands for "Hallucination Detection for Scientific Content". The task is to detect hallucinated claims in the answers to scientific questions generated by GenAI-powered research assistants. Given the claims and the references refer to them, the system need to detect whether the references Entail/Contradict/Unverifiable to the claims. To see more relationships between claims and references, see the image below for more details.
- This code is for our hallucination detection pipeline that utilizes open large language models for the shared task hosted by the 5-th SDP workshop (co-located with ACL). For more details about the task and dataset, please refer to [the shared task page](https://sdproc.org/2025/scihal.html).
