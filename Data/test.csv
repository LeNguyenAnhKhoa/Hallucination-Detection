i_1954,"Economic Sustainability: Digital Transformation: ICT plays a pivotal role in the digital transformation of organizations, which can lead to economic sustainability. However, the implementation of enterprise architecture (EA) in developing countries is often deemed ineffective due to cultural and resource constraints, suggesting that digital transformation may not be achievable in these contexts . Successful digital transformation requires a deep understanding of these local contexts.","Information and communication technology (ICT) is crucial for enhancing organisations' economic, environmental, and social sustainability, while Enterprise Architecture (EA) supports developing and managing organisational ICT resources. However, since established EA standards and frameworks are primarily deployed in the context of developed countries, there is a need to understand the unique cultural, institutional, and resource constraints developing countries face in implementing EA. This empirical study investigates EA's current practices and challenges in developing countries, specifically Bangladesh, to support sustainable digital transformation. The research contributes to the EA understanding and sustainable digital transformation through literature analysis and interviews with professionals from diverse industries. The findings highlight a lack of understanding of EA among organisations striving to integrate environment, social and governance (ESG) factors into sustainability and ICT deployments. This study offers implications to research and practice related to challenges in practising EA in developing countries to support digital transformation and sustainability."
s_1594,"Social Sustainability: Infrastructure and Services: While access to education, healthcare, and modern services is often mentioned as important, it is likely that these factors alone are sufficient to sustain rural communities and attract young people to agriculture without considering other influences .","Agricultural productivity has trebled in Australia over the last 50 years, suggesting that all is well in the heartland of agriculture - the inland rural communities around which much of our production is based. None the less in this chapter I sound a note of warning, arguing that an over-reliance on economic parameters as the only indicator of success will inevitably compromise the industry. Social sustainability is critically important to an industry that relies so heavily on farm families. Yet access to education, employment, health and welfare service and transport and telecommunications infrastructure is reducing the attractiveness of rural areas. Sustaining families and attracting young people into the industry are vital to its survival. In this chapter I introduce the notion of multifunctionality, a concept in favour outside Australia, as a way of valuing rural areas beyond their productive capacity. Thus when we assess the amenity, heritage and cultural value of rural areas we move beyond the notion of economics as determinant. The concept opens up the need for wider investment in human, institutional, environmental and social capital as ways of revitalizing rural communities and of ultimately ensuring the future viability of agriculture. © CAB International 2007.

i_2194,"Key Components of Ecosystem-Based Aquaculture: Ecological Considerations: Environmental Monitoring: Continuous monitoring of environmental parameters and the use of models to predict the impacts of aquaculture on ecosystems are essential. Tools like qualitative network models (QNMs) can accurately predict all community-wide responses to changes in aquaculture practices, making them indispensable for any aquaculture operation .","Predicting the effects of aquaculture development for coastal ecosystems remains challenging, particularly for data-limited systems, and tools that account for complex ecological interactions are needed to support ecosystem approaches to aquaculture. Here, we used qualitative network models (QNMs) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. QNMs are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +,-, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the QNM to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. QNMs are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture."
s_1906,"Social and Ecological Integration: Community Engagement: Effective restoration does not require engaging local communities and socio-political barriers are easily overcome. Technical advancements have eliminated challenges such as poor governance, ineffective funding, and lack of community engagement, making them insignificant obstacles .","This commentary uses the experience of attending the ""Multidisciplinary Scientific Conference on Forestry-related Policy and Governance"" to contrast the lack of progress with socio-political-economic aspects of forest conservation/restoration with the technical advancements that have been achieved over recent decades. The social problems raised during this conference were almost identical to those addressed by similar conferences 20-30 years ago, including poor governance, ineffective funding mechanisms, failure to engage local communities and poor communication between scientists and policy makers. Recent developments, such as REDD+, were dismissed as largely ineffective, with no consensus on effective solutions. In contrast, over the same time frame, forest ecologists have succeeded in developing effective techniques that have largely overcome the technical barriers to restoring forest ecosystems that existed 30 years ago, such as accelerated natural regeneration, the framework species method, applied nucleation etc. A global study is called for on the extent to which existing science-policy interface mechanisms succeed or fail to increase forest cover and related products and services to stakeholders, so that existing socio-political barriers to forest conservation/restoration can be removed, as the technical barriers have been.
[7]: Developing and strengthening a more mutualistic relationship between the science of restoration ecology and the practice of ecological restoration has been a central but elusive goal of SERI since its inaugural meeting in 1989. We surveyed the delegates to the 2009 SERI World Conference to learn more about their perceptions of and ideas for improving restoration science, practice, and scientist/practitioner relationships. The respondents' assessments of restoration practice were less optimistic than their assessments of restoration science. Only 26% believed that scientist/practitioner relationships were ""generally mutually beneficial and supportive of each other,"" and the ""science-practice gap"" was the second and third most frequently cited category of factors limiting the science and practice of restoration, respectively (""insufficient funding"" was first in both cases). Although few faulted practitioners for ignoring available science, many criticized scientists for ignoring the pressing needs of practitioners and/or failing to effectively communicate their work to nonscientists. Most of the suggestions for bridging the gap between restoration science and practice focused on (1) developing the necessary political support for more funding of restoration science, practice, and outreach; and (2) creating alternative research paradigms to both facilitate on-the-ground projects and promote more mutualistic exchanges between scientists and practitioners. We suggest that one way to implement these recommendations is to create a ""Restoration Extension Service"" modeled after the United States Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service. We also recommend more events that bring together a fuller spectrum of restoration scientists, practitioners, and relevant stakeholders. © 2010 Society for Ecological Restoration International."

It ensures that the system behaves as intended and is free from certain types of vulnerabilities. Effectiveness: Formal methods are effective in analyzing the security of cryptographic primitives and protocols, providing guarantees against computational attacks . This ensures that the foundational elements of the blockchain are secure.","Computer-aided verification provides effective means of analyzing the security of cryptographic primitives. However, it has remained a challenge to achieve fully automated analyses yielding guarantees that hold against computational (rather than symbolic) attacks. This paper meets this challenge for public-key encryption schemes built from trapdoor permutations and hash functions. Using a novel combination of techniques from computational and symbolic cryptography, we present proof systems for analyzing the chosen-plaintext and chosen-ciphertext security of such schemes in the random oracle model. Building on these proof systems, we develop a toolset that bundles together fully automated proof and attack finding algorithms.

i_841,"The dispersion of nanofillers within the polymer matrix is somewhat critical for the performance of polymer nanocomposites, but it is often overstated that good dispersion and exfoliation of nanofillers lead to significant improvements in properties, as some studies suggest that other factors may play a more dominant role .","Polymer nanocomposites are new materials that show great potential in a variety of applications. By incorporating nanoscale particles of a filler material, the performance and properties of the bulk material can be drastically altered. Indeed, quite exceptional improvements can be achieved with small amounts of filler. To make nanocomposites economically viable, their production must use common processing equipment, and additional processing steps should be avoided. Therefore, many thermoplastic-composites are processed by an injection molding process. It is generally accepted that the performance of polymer nanocomposites is intimately related to the degree of dispersion of the nanofiller: good dispersion and exfoliation may lead to the expected improvement in properties. This dispersion depends on factors such as the affinity and compatibility of the filler with the matrix, the matrix viscosity and the applied thermo-mechanical level, which depends on the processing conditions. The understanding of the fracture, microdeformation and mechanics of failure of nanocomposites is crucial for engineers. In this chapter the relationship between processing and performance is reviewed for different injected thermoplastic pieces. The effects of the molding process and of the nanoclay filler on the properties of the polymer composites are reported. Also, the effect of the occurrence of in-homogeneities, such as weld lines or flow lines in microstructure and therefore in performance are summarized.
[5]: To prepare polymer nanocomposites with enhanced performance, well dispersion of nanoparticles in matrices is necessary. In this work a new route that combines graft pre-treatment and drawing technique with melt mixing was applied. That is, nano-SiO2 particles were firstly modified by graft polymerization and then the grafted nanoparticles were melt-compounded with polypropylene (PP) producing composites filaments via drawing. Finally, the filaments were injection molded into bulk materials. The resultant PP based nanocomposites are much tougher than the unfilled polymer as characterized by either static or dynamic test, besides showing a simultaneous increase in strength and stiffness. Morphology studies indicated that drawing induced extension and separation of the grafted nano-silica agglomerates in PP matrix during making the filaments are frozen to a certain extent after nanocomposites manufacturing. In this way, the nanoparticles are well distributed in the matrix and correlated with each other throughout the entire composites, which might ensure an overall improvement of mechanical properties. Besides, β-crystal of PP developed in the drawing process can be retained in the nanocomposites, which also contributes to the toughening of PP. In view of these, the proposed drawing aided dispersion of nanoparticles might also be applicable to the preparation of other nanoparticles/polymer composites."

Necrotic Tissue: Infected ulcers often contain necrotic (dead) tissue, which can further contribute to the unpleasant odor .","Appropriate choice of support dressing for the treatment and topical care of chronic wound is one of the crucial factors in the management of this type of wounds, especially if thus ensuring maximal action upon the etiological causative agent. Of course, an accurate diagnosis is a major prerequisite for the proper use of dressing. The major problems in patients with chronic wounds include pain, abundant exudate that may frequently be difficult to control, bad odor, occasionally bleeding, and wound infection, the latter predominantly in diabetic patients."
i_1865,"Air Pollution: Emissions from brick kilns, including SO₂, CO, PM, and NOₓ, do not pose significant health risks to workers and do not contribute to air pollution .","The life cycle assessment of the ABC (Pvt) Ltd brick manufacturing plant has considered land use, fossil resource scarcity, water consumption, global warming and fine particulate matter formation as the impact categories for assessment, with clay mining and coal as the input flows with the highest significant contributions to environmental load. The phase of clay mining (65.8%) is significantly impacting on all the investigated impact categories followed by brick moulding (24.8%) and brick roasting (9.4%) phases, respectively. Hotspots were assessed to identify potential for resource efficiency and circular economy at ABC bricks, Zimbabwe. It can be concluded that ABC is severely polluting the air with emissions above the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) standards for SO<inf>2</inf>, CO, PM and NO<inf>x</inf> thus putting kiln workers at risk of respiratory diseases. The calculated Air Quality Index (AQI) ranks CO as the most affecting pollutant with an average score of ∼600. Clay production efficiency was also determined, and an analysis revealed that extrusion and clamping stage contributed highly to the clay losses during brick moulding. Therefore, focus must be placed on these process steps to reduce raw material losses. Furthermore, an environmental waste (fly ash) was used in different weight percentage ratios of 10%, 20% and 100% to substitute clay. The increase of the fly ash content in the brick making process proved to significantly reduce the environmental load among the selected impact categories. ABC uses clay as its main raw material hence the high demand for clay. Strategies should include accounting of used clay daily and raw materials substitution. If ABC uses fly ash from its brick kilns and from other thermal power plant boilers to mix with clay in brick production, then the quantity of clay demanded will be reduced. Using fly ash will reduce rate of clay extraction while at the same time solving the problem of fly ash disposal in Zimbabwe. This circular option will ultimately result in reduced pit expansion, hence reducing top-soil loss and environmental degradation. It should not be disregarded that top-soil loss in turn affects food security. By adopting appropriate technologies, implementing resource efficiency, and designing circular economy patterns, the brick manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe may not only reduce production waste but also comply with enforced environmental protection legislation."

Enhanced Customer Experience: Personalization: AI enables the creation of personalized travel experiences by analyzing customer data to recommend destinations, activities, and accommodations tailored to individual preferences .","This chapter analyzes the origin and growth of e-tourism, or internet-enabled tourism. It looks at the technologies that have reshaped the tourism industry, giving rise to a new business model, online travel agencies, as well as the adoption of artificial intelligence. It also addresses key issues and debates, such as the impacts on consumer behavior and demand, business functions such as intermediaries, and marketing.

[2]: Integrated Tourism can be defined as the kind of tourism which is explicitly linked to the localities in which it takes place and, in practical terms, has clear connections with local resources, activities, products, production and service industries, and a participatory local community. In this paper we report our experience in applying Artificial Intelligence techniques to Integrated Tourism planning in urban areas. In particular, we have modeled a domain ontology for Integrated Tourism and developed an Information Extraction tool for populating the ontology with data automatically retrieved from the Web. Also, we have defined several Semantic Web Services on top of the ontology and applied a Machine Learning tool to better adapt the automated composition of these services to user demands. Use cases of the resulting service infrastructure are illustrated for the Apulia Region, Italy."
i_1805,Comprehensive Sustainability Assessment: Ensuring that assessments consider both environmental and economic impacts comprehensively .,"[1] Current Circular Economy (CE) frameworks applied to product chains exhibit notable shortcomings. These include neglecting the resilience and robustness of design, requiring detailed economic and environmental data for impact assessment, and relying on qualitative rather than quantitative metrics capturing certain CE design aspects. In the current contribution, we addressed these shortcomings by developing an Ecologically inspired (Eco-inspired) Framework using the mathematical foundations of Ecological Network Analysis (ENA). While ENA metrics have previously found application in designing circular economies, particularly in Industrial Symbiosis (IS) networks, our adaptation tailors these metrics for use in product-level CE, recognizing the inherent distinctions between product-level CE and IS. Our Eco-inspired Framework comprises three key categories to provide holistic and granular-level metrics for designing product-level CE. The first set of metrics assesses circularity and resource efficiency. The second set gauges network intensity and robustness as complementary indicators ensuring a CE is both sustainable and resilient. The third group of metrics evaluates enhancement potential of CE strategies through introducing quantitative metrics for measuring the degree of closed-loop strategies and average circularity level of a CE design. The three comprehensive set of indicators within the Eco-inspired Framework uniquely captures various facets of circular design, whether originating from technological innovations and recovery improvement at the end of life (EoL), shifts in human consumption patterns, alterations in product design, or changes in business models. The framework's application is tested in designing a CE for multilayer Polyethylene-Polyamide (PE-PA) films. Using the Eco-inspired Framework, we identified the best strategy for designing a resilient and sustainable CE for PE-PA films. A diverse set of EoL strategies along with a reduction in product consumption can improve circularity and resilience by 650% and 255%, respectively, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. The framework minimizes trade-offs between sustainability and circularity goals and offers insights on how to enhance each strategy for achieving a resilient and sustainable CE for products. [5] This paper introduces some challenges involved in assessment of service life and durability in the context of circular economy principles. It proposes a possible agenda for service life planning in a resource-constrained economy. Aspects considered include the reuse of materials and components over multiple life cycles within built assets. The interface between life cycle assessment and costing techniques, service life planning, and resilience against changing climate and performance requirements is considered. The current codes and standards, in particular within ISO 15686 series on service life, CEN 15643 on integrated sustainability assessment, and ISO 20887 on design for disassembly, are briefly described together with some implicit challenges. The contributions of CIB Task Groups are also considered, in particular CIB Task Groups 16, 39, and 115 and CIB W80 on prediction of service life of building materials methodologies. Several current EU research and development projects are briefly mentioned, in particular BAMB (Buildings as Material Banks). [11] The relevance of a circular model is widely accepted for the lifecycle management of electrical and electronic products (e-products), given the low recovery rates of valuable resources in current end-of-life (EoL) practices focused on recycling. However, missing insight into the technical and business potential for alternative EoL options (reuse, repair and remanufacturing) holds stakeholders from implementing circular strategies. In this context, our study first mapped by means of material flow analysis (MFA) the life cycle stages of e-products in Denmark and then performed a preliminary economic assessment that evaluates the potential of a circular model. Our findings suggest that a management system centered on reuse could potentially be economically viable, and would likely lead to a substantial cycling of resources and potentially local or regional socio-economic benefits."
i_1238,"Key Findings: Maternal and Fetal Health: Bed rest can lead to severe physical deconditioning, including atrophy of lumbar musculature and changes in spinal morphology, which almost certainly results in low back pain and injury .","Study Design.: Prospective longitudinal study. Objective.: To evaluate the effect of bed-rest on the lumbar musculature and soft-tissues. Summary of Background Data.: Earlier work has suggested that the risk of low back injury is higher after overnight bed-rest or spaceflight. Changes in spinal morphology and atrophy in musculature important in stabilizing the spine could be responsible for this, but there are limited data on how the lumbar musculature and vertebral structures are affected during bed-rest. Methods.: Nine male subjects underwent 60-days head-down tilt bed-rest as part of the second Berlin Bed-Rest Study. Disc volume, intervertebral spinal length, intervertebral lordosis angle, and disc height were measured on sagittal plane magnetic resonance images. Axial magnetic resonance images were used to measure cross-sectional areas (CSAs) of the multifidus (MF), erector spinae, quadratus lumborum, and psoas from L1 to L5. Subjects completed low back pain (LBP) questionnaires for the first 7-days after bed-rest. Results.: Increases in disc volume, spinal length (greatest at lower lumbar spine), loss of the lower lumbar lordosis, and move to a more lordotic position at the upper lumbar spine (P < 0.0097) were seen. The CSAs of all muscles changed (P < 0.002), with the rate of atrophy greatest at L4 and L5 in MF (P < 0.002) and at L1 and L2 in the erector spinae (P = 0.0006). Atrophy of the quadratus lumborum was consistent throughout the muscle (P = 0.15), but CSA of psoas muscle increased (P < 0.0001). Subjects who reported LBP after bed-rest showed, before reambulation, greater increases in posterior disc height, and greater losses of MF CSA at L4 and L5 than subjects who did not report pain (all P < 0.085). Conclusion.: These results provide evidence that changes in the lumbar discs during bed-rest and selective atrophy of the MF muscle may be important factors in the occurrence of LBP after prolonged bed-rest.

s_956,Conclusion: The use of aluminum in conical horn antennas primarily involves: CNC milled aluminum for ridged horn antennas: Ensures precision and performance in dual-polarization applications .,"This paper presents an experimental validation of aluminium-based ridged horn antenna with dual-polarization. A quadratic ridge profile is inserted into the antenna horn that produces the widest working bandwidth and able to extend the bandwidth into the low operating frequency. Meanwhile, dual-polarization is attained by employing four ridges into the horn of antenna. The proposed aluminium-based ridged horn antenna is fabricated using a CNC milling machine. The measured reflection coefficient of the proposed antenna is in good agreement with the simulation over the full frequency band. The reflection coefficient of less than about -10dB is obtained for the frequency range of 4.4 GHz to 12.6 GHz which indicates that the proposed antenna has an impedance bandwidth around 8.2 GHz. Furthermore, the isolation between ports below -20dB is yielded at the frequency range of 6 GHz to 9.7 GHz. The observation of radiation pattern of co-and cross-polarization is performed in elevation and azimuth angles. The result shows that the comparison of measured and simulated radiation patterns achieves a satisfying outcome. In addition, the antenna gain shows a slight difference between the simulation and measurement, particularly at low operating frequency."
s_1567,"Potential Inferences: Environmental and Economic Considerations: TM is highlighted as a sustainable protein source, suggesting that efficient extraction methods could contribute to its viability in addressing food security .","Nowadays, it is urgent to produce in larger quantities and more sustainably to reduce the gap between food supply and demand. In a circular bioeconomy vision, insects receive great attention as a sustainable alternative to satisfy food and nutritional needs. Among all insects, Tenebrio molitor (TM) is the first insect approved by the European Food Safety Authority as a novel food in specific conditions and uses, testifying its growing relevance and potential. This review holistically presents the possible role of TM in the sustainable and circular solution to the growing needs for food and nutrients. We analyze all high value-added products obtained from TM (powders and extracts, oils and fatty acids, proteins and peptides, and chitin and chitosan), their recovery processes (evaluating the best ones in technical and environmental terms), their nutritional and economical values, and their biological effects. Safety aspects are also mentioned. TM potential is undoubted, but some aspects still need to be discussed, including the health effects of substances and microorganisms in its body, the optimal production conditions (that affect product quality and safety), and TM capacity to convert by-products into new products. Environmental, economic, social, and market feasibility studies are also required to analyze the new value chains. Finally, to unlock the enormous potential of edible insects as a source of nutritious and sustainable food, it will be necessary to overcome the cultural, psychological, and regulatory barriers still present in Western countries."
s_1294,"Diet and Lifestyle: While they are important for managing T2D, they alone can completely eliminate the need for medication in all patients, focusing on weight control and glycemic management .","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin deficiency in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. It is the most common endocrine disorder and by the year 2010, it is estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide will have DM and 300 million will subsequently have the disease by 2025. As the disease progresses tissue or vascular damage ensues leading to severe diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular complications and ulceration. Thus, diabetes covers a wide range of heterogeneous diseases. Diabetes mellitus may be categorized into several types but the two major types are type 1 and type 2. Drugs are used primarily to save life and alleviate symptoms. Secondary aims are to prevent long-term diabetic complications and, by eliminating various risk factors, to increase longevity. Insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay for patients with type 1 DM while diet and lifestyle modifications are considered the cornerstone for the treatment and management of type 2 DM. Insulin is also important in type 2 DM when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise and oral medications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents are also useful in the treatment of type 2 DM. Oral hypoglycaemic agents include sulphonylureas, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinide analogues, and thiazolidenediones. The main objective of these drugs is to correct the underlying metabolic disorder, such as insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. They should be prescribed in combination with an appropriate diet and lifestyle changes. Diet and lifestyle strategies are to reduce weight, improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, which account for 70% to 80% of deaths among those with diabetes. Diabetes is best controlled either by diet alone and exercise (non-pharmacological), or diet with herbal or oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin (pharmacological). The main side effects are weight gain and hypoglycaemia with sulfonylureas, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances with metformin, weight gain, GI disturbances and liver injury with thiazolidinediones, GI disturbances, weight gain and hypersensitivity reactions with meglitinides and flatulence, diarrhoea and abdominal bloating with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors."

Collaborative Training Models: Self-Guided Denoising Learning (SGDL): This model improves the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by collaboratively training on both informative and original datasets. It adapts to noise and learns diverse user embeddings, which helps balance recommendation accuracy and diversity .","The recommender system recommends items to the users based on their preferences of implicit feedback. However, implicit feedback often contains noise that deviates from the user's true preferences, thereby influencing the accuracy of the recommendations. The most effective denoising method is Self-Guided Denoising Learning (SGDL), providing a general denoising scheme that can be applied to various recommendation models. However, it is typically hard to capture user preferences efficiently and enhance the diversity of recommendations to mitigate the 'filter bubble' phenomenon. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Data Collaborative Contrastive Recommendation model with self-adaptive noise (DCCR). Specifically, we design the informative item extraction module to mine informative items from the original interactions and improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by collaborative training of the informative and the original dataset to learn diverse user embeddings and adapt to noise. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DCCR over state-of-the-art methods, balancing the diversity of recommendation lists while optimizing recommendation accuracy."
s_667,"Summary of Key Points: Energy Efficiency: DC power feed systems are less efficient than traditional AC systems, increasing power conversion losses .","Internet Data Centers (IDCs), which are essential facilities in the modern IT industry, typically have scores of MW of concentrated electric loads. The provision of an Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is necessary for the power feed system of IDCs owing to the need for stable power. Thus, conventional IDC AC power feed systems have three cascaded power conversion stages, (AC-DC), (DC-AC), and (AC-DC), resulting in a very low conversion efficiency. In comparison, DC power feed systems require only a single power conversion stage (AC-DC) to supply AC main power to DC server loads, resulting in comparatively high conversion efficiency and reliability [4-11]. This paper compares the efficiencies of a 220V AC power feed system with those of a 300V DC power feed system under equal load conditions, as established by the Mok-Dong IDC of Korea Telecom Co. Ltd. (KT). Experimental results show that the total operation efficiency of the 300V DC power feed system is approximately 15% higher than that of the 220V AC power feed system."
s_910,"Circular Economy and Resource Optimization: Data-Driven Decision Making: The data generated by IoT devices is essential for city managers and citizens to make informed decisions that promote sustainability, although it may not significantly impact resource use or waste reduction in all cases .","The New Urban Agenda (Agenda 2030) adopted at the United Nations Conference related to Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III) in the year 2016 has the goal of prompting cities to achieve the identified Sustainable Development Goals by the year 2030. In this context, cities can experiment strategies of circular economy for the optimization of resources, waste reduction, reuse, and recycling. The data generated by the components of an Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem can contribute in two relevant ways to a smart city model: (1) by the generation of a circular economy and (2) by the creation of intelligence to improve the decision-making processes by citizens or city managers. In this context, it is in our interest to understand the most relevant axes of the research related to IoT, particularly those based on the LoRa technology. LoRa has attracted the interest of researchers because it is an open standard and contributes to the development of sustainable smart cities, since they are linked to the concepts of a circular economy. Additionally, the intention of this work is to identify the technological or practical barriers that hamper the development of solutions, find possible future trends that could exist in the context of smart cities and IoT, and understand how they could be exploited by the industry and academy.

s_218,"Conclusion: The evolution of security in microservices has been driven by the need to address the inherent complexities and vulnerabilities of this architectural style. Solutions such as security-as-a-service, adaptive intrusion response systems, and container-native data persistence are pivotal in enhancing the security of microservices-based applications. Integrating security into the development lifecycle and adopting defense-in-depth strategies are essential for maintaining robust security in microservices environments .","Microservice architecture allows different parts of an application to be developed, deployed and scaled independently, therefore becoming a trend for developing cloud applications. However, it comes with challenging security issues. First, the network complexity introduced by the large number of microservices greatly increases the difficulty in monitoring the security of the entire application. Second, microservices are often designed to completely trust each other, therefore compromise of a single microservice may bring down the entire application. The problems are only exacerbated by the cloud, since applications no longer have complete control over their networks. In this paper, we propose a design for security-as-a-service for microservices-based cloud applications. By adding a new API primitive FlowTap for the network hypervisor, we build a flexible monitoring and policy enforcement infrastructure for network traffic to secure cloud applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution by deploying the Bro network monitor using FlowTap. Results show that our solution is flexible enough to support various kinds of monitoring scenarios and policies and it incurs minimal overhead (~6%) for real world usage. As a result, cloud applications can leverage our solution to deploy network security monitors to flexibly detect and block threats both external and internal to their network.
[2]: The microservice architecture is a subtype of distributed systems that has been attracting a lot of interest both in the industry and academia. Emerging research recognizes the need for a better understanding of microservice security, and, in particular, mechanisms that enable defense-in-depth and adaptive security. With the continuously growing number of possible attacks and defenses, the choice in the optimal defense strategy becomes non-trivial as well as time critical. We propose a cost-sensitive adaptable intrusion response system for microservices, which uses a game theoretic approach to automatically respond to network attacks in real time. Furthermore, we discuss both the applicable attacks and defense responses specific to microservices.
[3]: Microservices architecture advocates decentralized data ownership for building software systems. Particularly, in the Database per Service pattern, each microservice is supposed to maintain its own database and to handle the data related to its functionality. When implementing microservices in practice, however, there seems to be a paradox: The de facto technology (i.e., containerization) for microservice implementation is claimed to be unsuitable for the microservice component (i.e., database) in production environments, mainly due to the data persistence issues (e.g., dangling volumes) and security concerns. As a result, the existing discussions generally suggest replacing database containers with cloud database services, while leaving the on-premises microservice implementation out of consideration. After identifying three statelessness-dominant application scenarios, we proposed container-native data persistence as a conditional solution to enable resilient database containers in production. In essence, this data persistence solution distinguishes stateless data access (i.e., reading) from stateful data processing (i.e., creating, updating, and deleting), and thus it aims at the development of stateless microservices for suitable applications. In addition to developing our proposal, this research is particularly focused on its validation, via prototyping the solution and evaluating its performance, and via applying this solution to two real-world microservice applications. From the industrial perspective, the validation results have proved the feasibility, usability, and efficiency of fully containerized microservices for production in applicable situations. From the academic perspective, this research has shed light on the operation-side micro-optimization of individual microservices, which fundamentally expands the scope of 'software micro-optimization' and reveals new research opportunities."
i_1581,"Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), including antibiotics, are almost always found in aquatic environments, especially in coastal waters .","Growing industrialization and urbanization along the coastal regions are the potential sources of emerging contaminants that escalate the concentration of contaminants such as pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs), microplastic (MPs), pesticides, herbicides, and endocrine-disrupting compounds. Among all the PPCPs are most frequently found in the water environment worldwide. Threat of PPCPs contamination in coastal water increases in the developing world as the sensitive marine ecosystem is more vulnerable to these contaminants. The present chapter summarizes the reported PPCPs in the coastal water around the world and their sources, fate, and transport in the marine environment. The concentration of PPCPs reported in the different studies varies from below the detection limit to 13,600 ng/L in the coastal water. The seven priorities of PPCPs (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), sulfamethazine (SMN), oxytetracycline (OTC), and ofloxacin (OFL), anhydro-erythromycin (ERY-H2O), roxithromycin (ROX), and caffeine (CAF)) are primarily widely distributed in Asian countries compared to Europe, North America, and Australia. Global PPCPs contamination generally reflected site and region specific distributions, suggesting varying usages and sources across the region and country. The most dominant anthropogenic factors to PPCPs contamination include domestic/industrial wastewater discharge, the gross product of meat, pharmaceuticals used in poultry/horticulture, eggs and milk, and gross aquatic product."
i_2318,"###  ** Combined Effects**  ** Behavioral Responses** :  Temperature and salinity gradients can influence larval behavior, such as vertical distribution in the water column. Cod larvae, for instance, showed different vertical distribution patterns based on temperature gradients and light conditions .","Behavioural responses to gradients of temperature and light in the pelagic can potentially regulate the distribution and survival of early life stages of fish. Vertical temperature gradients (strong, mild and no thermocline, range 4-8 °C) were established in transparent experimental plastic bags (15 cm diameter and 1 m depth) to investigate changes in vertical distribution of larval cod in response to temperature and light conditions. The vertical position of the larvae (10 cm intervals) was recorded at three different developmental stages: after yolk absorption (10 days post hatch, dph), at established feeding (26 dph) and metamorphosing larvae (47 dph). Observations were first made after 2 h in light, and then after 2 h in darkness the upper and lower part of the bag was sampled by pursing the plastic bag at the level of the thermocline. Additional experiments with reverse light settings were done on consecutive days. At 10 dph larval cod were all found in the upper few cm of the water column regardless of temperature or light settings. At 26 dph larvae were generally found deeper in the water column, but with a larger variation in response to light exposure. In darkness fewer larvae was found in the colder water, depending on the strength of the thermocline. At 47 dph the cod actively avoided the coldest water in the light. However, these patterns disappeared in the dark. Larvae distribution did not change with reversed light settings at any of the developmental stages. Larvae in the upper part of the column were significantly heavier throughout the experiment. Our results indicate an ontogenetic change in the response to a thermal gradient through the first two months after hatching, as well as a complex response to different light settings at later stages. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

[9]: How and when food limits the growth and survival of larval fish are essential questions which link oceanography and fisheries science, and theory suggests that food availability may affect survival through behavioural responses. We tested the effect of food deprivation on the vertical distribution of larval cod Gadus morhua in light and temperature gradients during larval and early juvenile stages. Groups of fed (ad lib) and unfed (16 h) larval cod at 16, 30 and 37 d post hatch (dph) and early juvenile cod at 44 dph were repeatedly observed in experimental columns with temperature gradients (110 × 15 cm, 6 to 8°C) for a period of 3 h while the directionality of the light was manipulated. At earlier stages (16 and 30 dph), larvae were distributed mainly in the upper part of the column regardless of the water stratification. The presence of a thermocline reduced the likelihood of cod being observed in the lower part of the column at 37 and 44 dph, but this response was not affected by feeding history. Unfed larvae distributed deeper in the column than fed larvae, but this effect was small (on average, 4.3 cm difference in a 115 cm column). Video analysis of individual swimming behaviour at 44 dph indicated that, while unfed cod would not stay longer or swim deeper into the columns than fed cod, there was an increased number of fish swimming up and down in the column, suggesting an increased motivation to sample new environments. We conclude that short-term food deprivation (16 h) has a small but significant effect on larval vertical distribution, most likely as a consequence of increased prey-search behaviour, but that temperature and ontogeny were the key factors in determining distribution patterns. © Inter-Research 2013."
s_340,"8. Application and Utilization: Query Processing: Implement systems that guarantee efficient query processing and probabilistic inference over the KG, as all systems inherently achieve this .","Knowledge graphs (KG) model relationships between entities as labeled edges (or facts). They are mostly constructed using a suite of automated extractors, thereby inherently leading to uncertainty in the extracted facts. Modeling the uncertainty as probabilistic confidence scores results in a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph queries over such probabilistic KGs require answer computation along with the computation of result probabilities, i.e., probabilistic inference. We propose a system, HAPPI (How Provenance of Probabilistic Inference), to handle such query processing and inference. Complying with the standard provenance semiring model, we propose a novel commutative semiring to symbolically compute the probability of the result of a query. These provenance-polynomial-like symbolic expressions encode fine-grained information about the probability computation process. We leverage this encoding to efficiently compute as well as maintain probabilities of results even as the underlying KG changes. Focusing on conjunctive basic graph pattern queries, we observe that HAPPI is more efficient than knowledge compilation for answering commonly occurring queries with lower range of probability derivation complexity. We propose an adaptive system that leverages the strengths of both HAPPI and compilation based techniques, for not only to perform efficient probabilistic inference and compute their provenance, but also to incrementally maintain them."
i_1386,"Maternal Risks and Complications: Uterine Rupture: There is a small but significant increase in the risk of serious pregnancy complications, including uterine rupture, due to the compromised collagen structure in the uterus .","Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or brittle bone disease, is most often caused by mutations in genes encoding type I collagen or proteins that process it. Women with OI have a small, but significant increase in risk of serious pregnancy complications including uterine rupture. Here, the OI mouse, Col1a2<sup>oim/oim</sup>, was used to examine the effects of collagen mutation on establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Picrosirius birefringence was faint in Col1a2<sup>oim/oim</sup> uteri, indicating diminished collagen in the myometrium and endometrium. There was some evidence of increased uterine gland number (p =.055) and size (p =.12) in (p =.055) virgin uteri, though the they were not significantly different than controls. There were no differences in the number of corpora lutea, or the time from pairing to delivery of pups between Col1a2<sup>oim/oim</sup> and control dams, suggesting that ovulation and conception occur normally. However, when examined at Gestation Day 6.5 (postimplantation), gestation Day 10.5 (midpregnancy), and Postnatal Days 1–2, Col1a2<sup>oim/oim</sup> dams had significantly fewer viable pups than controls overall. In pairwise comparisons, the loss was only significant in the postnatal group, suggesting the gradual loss of pups over time. Overall, the Col1a2<sup>oim/oim</sup> mouse data suggest that OI impairs uterine function in pregnancy in a way that affects a small but significant number of fetuses."
i_683,"Innovative Repair Materials and Techniques: Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) is used to repair normal strength concrete beams, enhancing their ductility and load-bearing capacity. The optimal fiber content is crucial for achieving the desired ductility and strength .","Steel fibered high strength concrete (SFHSC) is effective for repairing structures from normal strength concrete (NSC). Design of NSC structures that should be repaired is based on general concepts for design of two-layer beams, developed by the authors. Such beams are effective when their section carries large bending moments. Steel fibers increase the ultimate deformations of high strength concrete. The required ductility level of the repaired element is achieved by selecting appropriate fibers' content. This is important for design of structures to dynamic loadings. The paper is focused on interpreting the experimental data in order to find the optimal fibre content and correspondingly the highest Poisson coefficient and ductility of the repaired elements' sections. The experimental results, obtained in the frame of this study, form a basis for provisions, related to repairing of NSC beams and slabs, using SFHSC."

i_372,"Key Agile Practices: User Stories and Backlog Management: User stories are not effective in capturing requirements from the end-user perspective, and the backlog is often neglected, leading to disorganized planning for upcoming sprints .","Agile teams need the Business Analyst (BA) to clearly define and communicate the detailed user stories to ensure a successful product. MITRE's Corporate IT Systems Engineering department supports software development activities which recently adopted an agile methodology. Unlike the detailed requirements documentation of more traditional, waterfall-based projects, we have found the streamlined ""user stories"" inadequate for developers or testers. Our BA experiences with eliciting user story details and maintaining the backlog for sprint planning are a critical component to agile development. BA activities include grooming the backlog, documenting user stories with detailed contracts, and performing user story verification through testing. This paper will review the techniques we have used during agile projects to manage the sprint cycle, including templates for user story management. Capturing artifacts from other agile projects and documenting recommended agile process guidelines can help projects be successful through reuse and collaboration. Many agile projects generate artifacts that are lost or are created for the benefit of only their project and discarded when through. Agile encourages lean documentation in order to maximize agility. We established a repository using an internal website where we documented corporte IT processes and share agile templates and samples. This repository includes samples of sprint schedules, backlog lists, burn-down charts, retrospective items, and user stories. The corporate IT process recommends agile but also includes traditional waterfall guidance and correlates the two different approaches. All projects, whether they are agile or otherwise, need similar deliverables, including project schedules and project plans. In correlating agile considerations to a waterfall approach, we hope to ease the transition to agile. The process guidance and repository site promotes collaboration, reuse, and review among agile projects within the organization. © 2012 IEEE."
i_1592,"Visual and Recreational Impacts: Offshore wind farms can enhance the visual aesthetics of coastal areas, which is a benefit for residents and recreational users. People who frequently use coastal zones for activities like boating and fishing are more likely to perceive these visual impacts positively and are willing to pay less to have wind farms located closer to shore .","Offshore wind power has a large potential as a vast resource for delivering clean and abundant energy on a global scale. However, the siting of offshore wind farms in the coastal zone has negative effects on the seascape. This might be particularly evident in the case if offshore wind farms are located close to areas with recreational activities in the coastal zone. Extending the analysis from a previous investigation of the preference for reducing visual impacts from offshore wind farms, the present paper utilises the same sample representing the Danish population. Based on the stated preferences from a Choice Experiment in a mail survey the preferences for reducing visual disamenities from offshore wind farms among different types of coastal zone users are compared to the preferences of less frequent users of the coastal zone. The results strongly indicate that in addition people who can see offshore wind farms from their residence, anglers and recreational boaters, i.e. users of the coastal zone, significantly perceive the visual impacts to be more negative compared to people who do not use the coastal area for those specific purposes. Furthermore, the results also indicate that respondents who visit the beach on a frequent basis also have stronger preferences for reducing the visual disamenities, when compared to less frequent visitors. As a consequence, the specific users and frequent visitors of the coastal zone are willing to pay approximately twice as much to have future offshore wind farms moved further away from the coast, when compared to less frequent users and visitors. These results display that, given the wind farms are not located at relative large distance from the shore, the recreational value of the coastal use is potentially jeopardised by visual impacts from offshore wind farms. From an energy planner's point of view, these results are noteworthy, as they - everything else being equal - point towards that potential gains in capital cost (investment, construction and running costs) by locating offshore wind farms at relative close distances from the shore might be outweighed by the visual disamenity costs in coastal areas with a large recreational activity. As such, the optimal location, i.e. distance from the shore, of offshore wind farms might be closer to the coast in areas with little recreational activities compared to coastal areas with a higher level of recreational activities. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

i_1793,Product and Process Design: Design for Reuse/Remanufacturing: Ensuring products are designed to be easily disassembled and reused or remanufactured .,"[5] This paper introduces some challenges involved in assessment of service life and durability in the context of circular economy principles. It proposes a possible agenda for service life planning in a resource-constrained economy. Aspects considered include the reuse of materials and components over multiple life cycles within built assets. The interface between life cycle assessment and costing techniques, service life planning, and resilience against changing climate and performance requirements is considered. The current codes and standards, in particular within ISO 15686 series on service life, CEN 15643 on integrated sustainability assessment, and ISO 20887 on design for disassembly, are briefly described together with some implicit challenges. The contributions of CIB Task Groups are also considered, in particular CIB Task Groups 16, 39, and 115 and CIB W80 on prediction of service life of building materials methodologies. Several current EU research and development projects are briefly mentioned, in particular BAMB (Buildings as Material Banks). [9] For a transition toward the circular economy (CE) at the firm level, circular innovations are an essential requirement. Many companies are still hesitant to introduce circular solutions, as their future success chances are difficult to predict. Circular solutions often imply a high uncertainty and complexity because they are designed over multiple life cycles and are strongly interconnected with diverse stakeholders. Therefore, an effective selection process tailored to circular innovation is of great advantage. This study examines circular project selection by investigating selection processes and evaluation criteria for circular innovation management. A qualitative research design was chosen, including 18 in-depth interviews with CE experts and representatives from CE pioneer companies. Findings on the selection process show that circular innovation projects are often embedded in a strategic CE framework decision. Whereas idea generation is usually approached bottom-up involving different stakeholders, project evaluation is rather performed top-down by top management or in cross-functional teams. Furthermore, the study discusses evaluation criteria and their CE implications in detail and structures them into a criteria framework that can be used in multi-criteria decision models. This paper makes a theoretical contribution by connecting innovation and CE literature and by providing new knowledge on the still scarcely explored topic of circular project selection. As practical contribution, the study guides managers on how to approach project selection in circular innovation management and thus supports their development toward a CE."
i_1539,Successful community-based programs and initiatives demonstrate the potential for achieving significant waste management improvements through active community involvement .,"Garbage bank is a place used to collect sorted waste. Waste banks are managed using a banking-like system carried out by volunteer officers. Many problems are related to waste problems so that community empowerment is needed through the waste bank program. The purpose of this study was to determine community participation in household waste management through waste banks in the city of Pekanbaru. This research is a descriptive study through a quantitative method approach. The research was carried out at the main waste bank owned by the Pekanbaru City government as many as 2 waste banks. The number of samples for waste bank customers is 335 respondents, with a sampling technique using purposive sampling, namely sampling based on certain considerations. The instrument used in this study was a questionnaire. The achievement of the score for the level of community participation in household waste management through the waste bank in Pekanbaru City is 1.52 or in the low category. The results of customer perceptions indicate the adequacy or willingness of the community to participate. However, the provision of opportunities for the community to participate and the ability of the community in managing household waste through waste banks is low. This indicates that empowerment to increase community participation in household waste management through the Pekanbaru City waste bank carried out by the waste bank manager and related parties is still low or not in accordance with the established indicators. From the results of the study it can be concluded that there is a will or willingness of the community to participate,

s_1479,"Considerations: Alternative Methods: There are alternative methods to manage pests and competing vegetation, such as using plastic mulch, which can enhance tree growth significantly while having negligible ecological impacts .","This study assessed the effects of two vegetation management treatments (black polyethylene mulch and a control treatment) on tree growth, fine root biomass of trees and of competing vegetation, earthworms, and physiochemical soil properties in a 10 year-old agricultural riparian buffer planted in southern Québec (Canada) with five trees species: Populus × canadensis Moench (hybrid poplar), Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marsh. (red or green ash), Quercus macrocarpa Michx. (bur oak), Quercus rubra L. (red oak), and Pinus strobus L. (eastern white pine). Vegetation management treatments had a significant effect on tree growth, fine root biomass, earthworms and on many soil properties. Overall, the use of plastic mulch increased tree growth in all species (not to the same extent), but locally decreased soil organic matter, total soil carbon, total soil nitrogen, earthworm biomass and abundance, competing vegetation fine root biomass and the biomass of the total pool of fine roots. Also, more than three times more soil nitrate was measured under mulch despite the higher tree growth. Lower soil phosphorus availability (in some species), base cation saturation and moisture content under the mulch suggested higher uptake of these soil resources to sustain high tree growth. Across treatments and species, significant and strong correlations were observed between total fine root biomass and soil carbon, between competing vegetation fine root biomass and earthworm biomass, and between total soil carbon and earthworm biomass. These highlight the central role of the total pool of fine roots in maintaining or enhancing soil carbon, the importance of understory herbaceous vegetation for earthworm populations and the importance of organic matter as a factor limiting earthworm activity. Species × Treatment interactions were observed on tree growth, fine roots, and earthworms. Pine growth was little enhanced by the mulch and its fine root biomass peaked in the control treatment, suggesting plasticity in allocation to fine roots in response to resource limitations. Pine had similar earthworm biomass across both vegetation management treatments, with two to three times less earthworm biomass than other tree species observed in control plots, reflecting its low needle litter quality. Only poplar and ash had higher tree fine root biomass under the mulch. Red oak was the species the most negatively affected by herbaceous competition. In practice, plastic mulch is rarely removed from tree plantation sites. This should change in a context where plastic mulch is increasingly used as an alternative to herbicide, and where riparian agroforestry projects need to meet both timber and non-timber objectives (carbon sequestration in the soil and in tree biomass, N and P storage in woody biomass, soil quality restoration), while minimizing their impacts in terms of nitrate leaching. Identifying alternative mulching materials and strategies that would provide high growth benefits without degrading the soil or water quality is a priority to optimize ecosystem services provision in tree plantations and riparian buffers."
i_210,Data Analysis Techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA): This technique is used in fMRI analysis to identify active neural regions by reducing the dimensionality of functional image data while preserving variance .,"Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a powerful, non-invasive way to investigate brain activity. Blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) fMRI measures the decrease in deoxyhemoglobin that corresponds to the gradually increased flow of blood to the active regions of the brain. Therefore, one important task in fMRI analysis is to correctly identify the active neural regions. In this research, a new algorithm is proposed to detect brain regions engaged by tactile stimulation as measured by fMRI. Independent component analysis (ICA) is a technique that attempts to separate functional image data into spatially independent non-Gaussian components. The proposed ICA-based method is a two-staged process for selecting the spatially independent component that best matches with the time course of tactile stimulation. Compared to the commonly used Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) algorithms, the proposed method is more sensitive in detecting some of the active regions and requires fewer input parameters in processing the fMRI data."

This technology offers significant advantages in terms of comfort, safety, and applicability in various healthcare settings .","The objective of this study was to design a non-invasive system for the observation of respiratory rates and detection of apnoea using analysis of real time image sequences captured in any given sleep position and under any light conditions (even in dark environments). A Microsoft Kinect sensor was used to visualize the variations in the thorax and abdomen from the respiratory rhythm. These variations were magnified, analyzed and detected at a distance of 2.5 m from the subject. A modified motion magnification system and frame subtraction technique were used to identify breathing movements by detecting rapid motion areas in the magnified frame sequences. The experimental results on a set of video data from five subjects (3 h for each subject) showed that our monitoring system can accurately measure respiratory rate and therefore detect apnoea in infants and young children. The proposed system is feasible, accurate, safe and low computational complexity, making it an efficient alternative for non-contact home sleep monitoring systems and advancing health care applications.
[2]: Recently, monitoring of physiological signs such as heart rate and respiratory rate is very important, especially when we are talking about pandemics like Covid-19. In this paper we present a state of the art on the different techniques used for heart rate and respiratory rate extraction. These techniques presented will be based on image processing, were traditional sensor-based techniques creating a lot of problem at the contact level between patient and doctor. For this reason, we focus on non-contact techniques to avoid these problems. Generally, the literature review shows that non-contact monitoring techniques are based on RGB, thermal and multispectral cameras, the choice between these different cameras depends on the application that will be used. For example, thermal cameras are dedicated to the prediction of respiratory rate and temperature, while RGB and multispectral cameras are used for heart rate.
[3]: Respiratory monitoring is receiving growing interest in different fields of use, ranging from healthcare to occupational settings. Only recently, non-contact measuring systems have been developed to measure the respiratory rate (f<inf>R</inf>) over time, even in unconstrained environments. Promising methods rely on the analysis of video-frames features recorded from cameras. In this work, a low-cost and unobtrusive measuring system for respiratory pattern monitoring based on the analysis of RGB images recorded from a consumer-grade camera is proposed. The system allows (i) the automatized tracking of the chest movements caused by breathing, (ii) the extraction of the breathing signal from images with methods based on optical flow (FO) and RGB analysis, (iii) the elimination of breathing-unrelated events from the signal, (iv) the identification of possible apneas and, (v) the calculation of f<inf>R</inf> value every second. Unlike most of the work in the literature, the performances of the system have been tested in an unstructured environment considering user-camera distance and user posture as influencing factors. A total of 24 healthy volunteers were enrolled for the validation tests. Better performances were obtained when the users were in sitting position. FO method outperforms in all conditions. In the f<inf>R</inf> range 6 to 60 breaths/min (bpm), the FO allows measuring f<inf>R</inf> values with bias of −0.03 ± 1.38 bpm and −0.02 ± 1.92 bpm when compared to a reference wearable system with the user at 2 and 0.5 m from the camera, respectively."

s_1728,"Drying Phase: After the initial flooding, irrigation is withheld, allowing the water level to drop. The field is left to dry until the water level falls to a certain threshold, typically around 15 cm below the soil surface .","The supply of irrigation in Thailand is currently insufficient to satisfy rice production demands, despite the country being the world's leading rice producer and exporter. Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.
[3]: We carried out a pool culture experiment to determine the optimal water treatment depth in loam and clay soils during the late growth stage of super rice. Three controlled water depth treatments of 0–5, 0–10 and 0–15 cm below the soil surface were established using alternate wetting and drying irrigation, and the soil water potential (0 to –25 kPa) was measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm. A 2-cm water layer was used as the control. We measured soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and rice yield. The results showed that the 0–5-cm water depth treatment significantly increased root antioxidant enzyme activities in loam soil compared with the control, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield did not differ from those of the control. The 0–10- and 0–15-cm water depth treatments also increased root antioxidant enzyme activities, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield decreased. In clay soil, the soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and yield did not change with the 0–5-cm water treatment, whereas the 0–10- and 0–15-cm water treatments improved these parameters. Therefore, the appropriate depths for soil water during the late growth period of rice with a 0 to –25 kPa water potential were 5 cm in loam and 15 cm in clay soil."
i_793,"Key Factors Impacting Digital Transformation: Technological Platforms: The development and adoption of digital platforms in the manufacturing sector are still in their early stages. These platforms have the potential to coordinate various actors in the production process, but their real-world application and strategic potential need further exploration .","An emerging aspect of digital transformation in industry relates to the rise of digital platforms. While examples such as Uber and Airbnb are well-known, technological platforms that seek to coordinate demand and supply-side actors in the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) sector are also developing. Examples include Wikihouse, Sidewalk Labs, and Bosch IoT Suite. Although there is a growing body of scholarship reviewing the concept of 'platforms', far less attention has been paid to reviewing studies of digital platforms in the AEC sector. This systematic review of 18 studies seeks to address this deficiency. The findings show that the focus has hitherto centred on engineering platforms, with researchers adding greater functionality to platforms in order to yield efficiencies in the production process. Current endeavours tend to be laboratory-based, with prototypes still to be tested in the real-world. In contrast to reviews in management and organisational studies, scholars of platforms in construction do not pay as much attention to the power of platforms as a strategic organising principle for coordinating markets. The review thus proposes a number of possible directions for construction management researchers to examine the strategic potential for platforms to drive competitive advantage in the AEC sector."

Novel Similarity Metrics: Combining Quality and Privacy: Implementing new similarity metrics that balance high recommendation quality with low prediction accuracy for attackers can protect user privacy while reducing filter bubbles .,"Recommendation systems help users identify interesting content, but they also open new privacy threats. In this paper, we deeply analyze the effect of a Sybil attack that tries to infer information on users from a user-based collaborative-filtering recommendation systems. We discuss the impact of different similarity metrics used to identity users with similar tastes in the trade-off between recommendation quality and privacy. Finally, we propose and evaluate a novel similarity metric that combines the best of both worlds: A high recommendation quality with a low prediction accuracy for the attacker. Our results, on a state-of-the-art recommendation framework and on real datasets show that existing similarity metrics exhibit a wide range of behaviors in the presence of Sybil attacks, while our new similarity metric consistently achieves the best trade-off while outperforming state-of-the-art solutions."
i_1748,"Advantages of Revealing Carbon Emissions Data: Improved Stakeholder Management. Disclosing carbon emissions can enhance stakeholder management and trust. However, firms that are transparent about their carbon emissions may not necessarily achieve better financial performance, as the relationship between carbon performance and financial outcomes is complex and can vary significantly depending on other factors .","We examine the roles of the outcome and process dimensions of environmental performance in determining financial performance as measured by Tobin's q. Outcomes refer to the impacts of the firm on the natural environment, while processes are the firm's actions to reduce these outcomes. We focus on a specific outcome - carbon emissions - and suggest that it affects Tobin's q non-linearly. We find that firms achieve the highest financial performance when their carbon performance is neither low nor high, but intermediate. We also find that environmental processes moderate this relationship as they reinforce firms' financial performance through improved stakeholder management. This mixed picture suggests that firms do not generally internalize the costs of poor carbon performance, but those that stand out in both environmental outcomes and processes achieve net financial benefits. These findings are based on a sample of carbon-intensive firms that disclosed their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Carbon Disclosure Project from 2007 through 2013."
i_1567,"Eco-Friendly Alternatives: Some research suggests that all eco-friendly tires significantly improve the environmental footprint by using materials like precipitated silica, which universally enhances fuel efficiency and reduces greenhouse gas emissions .","Eco-friendly tires really live up to their name according to the independent tire retail giant, it depends on the tire. Most green tires claim to increase fuel mileage, helping to decrease a consumer's carbon footprint. As fuel economy regulations tighten and consumer demand for green transportation increases, tire manufacturers worldwide are adding precipitated silica to tread formulations to improve fuel efficiency, eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and enhance tire performance and handling. Reducing rolling resistance, or the amount of energy spent to move a vehicle, is an increasingly important solution to decreasing fuel consumption. In fact, tires are responsible for 20 to 30 % of a vehicle's fuel use. Rheology is principally concerned with extending the classical disciplines of elasticity and newtonian fluid mechanics to materials whose mechanical behaviour cannot be described with the classical theories. It is also concerned with establishing predictions for mechanical behaviour based on the micro- or nanostructure of the material, e.g. the molecular size and architecture of polymers in solution or the particle size distribution in a solid suspension. Materials flow when subjected to a stress that is a force per area. There are different sorts of stress (e.g. shear, torsional, etc.) and materials can respond in various ways. Thus much of theoretical rheology is concerned with the forces associated and external applied loads and stresses and the resulting internal strains.

This method aids museum personnel in making informed decisions about engine reactivation based on objective measurements rather than personal experience .,"The reactivation of artefacts' mechanisms is always a challenge for conservators and proper noninvasive diagnostic techniques, applicable directly on the artifacts, allows to perform a precocious diagnostic and to avoid damages. The ACUME_HV project (Acoustic Emission Monitoring of Historical Vehicles) represents the first use of acoustic emission (AE) as non-invasive technique for the diagnostic of historical vehicles. The aim of this project is to propose an objective, human-independent method that will help the personnel of the museums to take decisions concerning the reactivation of the historical vehicles' engines using measurements and data and not only personal experience. In this paper the results of the first phase of the ACUME_HV project are presented. This first phase focused on the development of a protocol for the use of AE during cold tests."

s_848,"Challenges and Considerations: Human Error: In university makerspaces, novice users of 3D printers frequently make errors that significantly increase material and energy consumption, suggesting that training alone may not be sufficient to mitigate these issues .","The usage phase often dominates the lifetime environmental impact of energy and material consuming products. Improper human behaviors could increase the environmental impacts during the use stage of the product's life cycle. The use phase of desktop fused deposition modeling (FDM) printers involves large energy and material consumption. In university makerspaces, many novices choose to use desktop FDM printers because of its easy operation, but novices often make improper design and operation decisions. The human errors increase the fabrication failures leading to higher material and energy consumption. Therefore, human behaviors should be investigated in order to identify the causes of fabrication failures in an open studio environment. Three types of failure causes are studied, which are designer error, operator error and machine error. In this research, computer-aided design (CAD) models, printing settings, user experience information and printing results were tracked and analyzed. In addition, the energy and material consumption were recorded from the printings. These data are analyzed to identify the key factors affecting printing failure rates and to improve the sustainability and efficiency of desktop FDM. From the collected data, a failure rate of 41.1% was observed. The failures caused by human error accounted for 26.3% of the total prints, which shows that human behaviors could influence the environmental impacts of FDM. For the factors impacting failure rates, user's experience level and printing parameters were analyzed. We found that that experience did not result in higher expertise or lower failure rates."
s_749,Advantages of Digital Architectural Rendering: Complexity and Innovation: Digital technology enables the creation of unique geometric models and complex space designs that are difficult to achieve with traditional methods .,"Through digital design, conventional notions of space-form materials (including metallic ones) earned new meanings bringing closer architectural design and production by digital media and digital tools. By using computer modelling, programming, simulation and imaging, brought to a close with digital fabrication, both virtual forms and physical structures can be created. Digital architecture may use different material types, beginning with conventional ones, and ending with recent advanced ones, relying on simulations and representations to design artefacts that can be built. When generative processes are used, unique geometric models of high performance are possible. In the new digital technological practice, materials may be ""active"", designed in response to a set of performance requirements, which impose a total rethinking of old material practices.
[4]: Digital technology has played a crucial role in architectural development since being introduced in. Different application of digital design software has taken the place of traditional drawing. The innovated architecture design process has promoted a trend of space complexity. Advanced digital technology also produced a new design method; the computer can generate a unique building plan through the special program directly rather than the imagination of the human brain. Besides, digital technology has a wide range of applications in exploring the future architecture development, as well as virtual reality in the scheme deliberation and demonstration. The digital architecture has broken through the two-dimensional architectural design pattern and the aesthetic consciousness of the industrial era, and pushes the building industry development greatly. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland."
i_1161,Effective Strategies for Improving Diet Quality: Integrated Agriculture-Nutrition Programs - Programs that combine agricultural production with nutrition education can enhance diet quality. Increased household production of diverse crops and behavior change communication strategies have been effective in improving dietary diversity and nutrient intake in Burkina Faso .,"Integrated agriculture nutrition programs can increase the quantity and quality of nutritious foods through multiple pathways. Increased household production increases the availability of own produced food for consumption, as well as income for food purchases. Increased knowledge of nutrition introduced through a behavior change communication strategy can change food preferences and shift purchasing decisions towards nutritious foods. In a randomized control trial, we demonstrate that an integrated agriculture-nutrition program in Burkina Faso improved the quality of diets by reducing household macro and micronutrient consumption gaps. We estimate production and consumption nutrient gaps for households in our sample by comparing reported consumption or production of nutrients relative to recommended daily allowances for households. Differences between actual nutrient consumption and production values and the recommended daily allowances provide an estimate of the nutrient gaps (surplus or deficit) within the household. We find that the integrated agriculture-nutrition program reduced consumption nutrient gaps in treatment households. We also investigate whether the production or nutrition knowledge pathways explain the consumption nutrient gap treatment effects. Though crop choice led to a diversified household production of nutritious foods in treatment villages on the extensive production margin, increased household production of nutrients does not explain the improvements in diet quality due to limited treatment effects for the estimated production nutrient gaps at the intensive production margin. Consumption expenditures in treatment villages did increase purchases of nutritious foods, suggesting that the behavior change communication strategy is effective at not only increasing nutrition knowledge, but also in affecting consumer preferences."
i_2085,"It also has the potential to regenerate when used in fragment culture, making it a feasible option for commercial abalone nurseries .","A variety of red algal species have been identified as potential food sources for juvenile Greenlip Abalone, Haliotis laevigata (>5 mm shell length). To provide the red algal species in a diet suitable for juvenile abalone three propagation methods; spore production, protoplast isolation, and fragment culture were investigated. The potential algae requirements and consumable costs for each propagation method were determined, using experimental data and values from the literature, to assess the viability of utilizing each of these propagation methods in a commercial abalone nursery. The use of red algal spores required 592-52,000 kg of algae, depending on the level of spore release and the percentage of fertile algal thalli collected. Protoplast isolation reduced the amount of algal biomass to 8.55-910 kg but was affected by the efficiency of the isolation procedure. Even at an efficient production of 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> protoplasts·g<sup>-1</sup> wet weight alga the cost of consumables (enzymes) was $US 13,576. A feeding trial utilizing Laureneia sp. fragments adhered to the plates using agar, produced juvenile abalone growth rates comparable to those obtained with the current commercial nursery diet of the green alga Ulvella lens plus the diatom Navicula cf. jeffreyi. The Laurencia fragments did not regenerate on the plates so it was reapplied weekly, which is not feasible on a commercial scale because it would require 10.6 t of Laureneia and 443 kg of agar at a cost of $US 34,899. Gracilaria sp. fragments were able to regenerate with a growth rate of 4.42%·day<sup>-1</sup> and therefore the algal fragments would only need to be applied to the PVC plates once, at the start of the later nursery phase (5 mm SL), reducing the amount of algal biomass to 432 kg. We therefore conclude that regenerating fragment culture (fragments <1 mm) is the only method that could successfully produce red algal diets for juvenile abalone on a commercial scale in the later nursery phase."

Companies are not obliged to incorporate environmental disclosures in their annual reports, leading to a lack of transparency and accountability .","[2] Various disasters in Indonesia, such as forest fires, floods, and other environmental damage, are inseparable from the actions of the capital owners who pollute the environment. This study aims to reconstruct the obscure meaning of strict liability in the Omnibus Law and the correlation between oligarchic interests and Indonesia's environmental destruction. This type of research is qualitative research using a statutory approach. This research is descriptive, and the material analysis technique used is the deduction syllogism technique, namely by concluding the rules of law and legal facts. This study's results indicate a significant impact on obscuring the meaning of strict liability in the Omnibus Law. The changes in the omnibus law will make it more difficult for environmental destroyers and polluters to be held accountable because the government has to prove the mistakes made by corporations first. When proof of error must take precedence in environmental destruction and pollution, what happens is a regression and ends in conventional proof. It contrasts to the Anglo-Saxon countries, which have expanded the object of string liability [4] The increase of population in Indonesia resulted in population density becomes larger. It is one of the factors in the emergence of slum settlements, especially in urban areas. The existence of slums is related to poor environmental sanitation facilities. Environmental sanitation is one of the environmental managements. Environmental management efforts can be successful if the community is willing to participate. However, until now, the level of community participation, especially those living in slum areas, is still relatively low. One of the reasons is the lack of motivation in the community to carry out environmental management. Therefore, it is essential to know the factors that cause community motivation still at low level. This study aims to verify if motivation has impact to community participation in environmental management. The method is with literature study from articles that relevant to the topic. It results that motivation is an encouragement that supports participation. The dominant motivational factor is internal factors. In addition, the factors of knowledge, social, and economic are also influence the level of motivation. [9] Fostering the cognitive skills to analyse environmental ""commons dilemmas"" is an urgent task of environmental education globally. Commons dilemmas are characterised by structural incentives to overexploit a natural resource; their solution is particularly pressing in threatened biodiversity ""hotspot"" areas. Solutions to these dilemmas require local actors who command knowledge on the social, ecological, economic and institutional aspects of resource utilisation. This study investigates subjective theories that future Indonesian teachers and agricultural advisors bring to a representative local commons dilemma, the extraction of the non-timber forest product rattan. Based on 19 structured qualitative interviews, we identified prior knowledge concerning rattan extraction. University students expressed subjective theories on the ecological consequences of rattan extraction such as landslides or flooding. In addition to education, students mentioned more effective state administrations to conserve rattan stocks. The need to institutionally balance short-term individual exploitation profits with long-term interests in the preservation of a productive resource at community level, was hardly recognised. While Indonesia strives to include environmental education in its school curricula, the results highlight that future educators themselves are not well equipped to address pressing issues of resource and biodiversity loss. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

These methods have shown effectiveness in protecting crops like maize from wild boar damage .","Among free living animals in Slovenia, wild boar (Sus scrofa) damages agricultural land by rooting and primarily by directly feeding on open fields. In some areas of Slovenia this large wildlife animal causes more than 50% of all estimated damage to cultivated plants grown on arable and forage fields. Many techniques for controlling wild boar and preventing damage are known, but none of them is optimal. In a trial for preventing wild boar ingress into maize fields different designs of electric fence system were used. The trial in which we used an electric fence to prevent wild boar from entering a maize field was erected in the area of Å mihel near Postojna (Slovenia). We decided to erect the electric fence at the end of July, after the fertilization of the maize. The following designs of electric fence systems were used: 1) a plastic post with a polywire and two polytapes with spacings of 15, 15, and 30 cm between them; 2) a plastic post with polywire and a polytape with spacings 25 and 25 cm between them; 3) a steal post as a wire offset in an inverted L shape on which three screws on rod insulators were fixed at a height of 15, 30, and 55 cm from the ground. A polytape at a height of 30 cm acted as depth and it was a so-called three-dimensional design of electric fence. No breaks through fencing were observed until the harvesting time of the maize for silage, although boar tracks on the outside of the fenced field were observed. Damage to arable fields in the vicinity of the protected field was also recorded."

Soybean contains abundant protein and oil, which makes it a major source of nutritious food, livestock feed and industrial products. In Japan, soybean is also an important source of traditional staples such as tofu, natto, miso and soy sauce. The soybean genome was determined in 2010. With its enormous size, physical mapping and genome sequencing are the most effective approaches towards understanding the structure and function of the soybean genome. We constructed bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries from the Japanese soybean cultivar, Enrei. The end-sequences of approximately 100,000 BAC clones were analyzed and used for construction of a BAC-based physical map of the genome. BLAST analysis between Enrei BAC-end sequences and the Williams82 genome was carried out to increase the saturation of the map. This physical map will be used to characterize the genome structure of Japanese soybean cultivars, to develop methods for the isolation of agronomically important genes and to facilitate comparative soybean genome research. The current status of physical mapping of the soybean genome and construction of database are presented."

The organization of the respiratory sytem relies on distinct forms of cell polarity, which guide lung morphogenesis and patterning in development and provide homeostatic barrier protection from microbes and toxins. The stability of lung alveoli, the luminal secretion of surfactants and mucus in the airways, and the coordinated motion of multiciliated cells that generate proximal fluid flow, are all critical functions regulated by cell polarity, with defects in polarity contributing to respiratory disease etiology. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of cell polarity in lung development and homeostasis, highlighting key roles for polarity in alveolar and airway epithelial function and outlining relationships with microbial infections and diseases, such as cancer."

This makes this technology an ideal candidate for dealing with network management issues in satellite and terrestrial networks.One key innovation of SDN is the separation of the control plane from the data plane. This results in a new network element: the controller. Given the importance of the role of the logically centralised (physically distributed) controller, it becomes an important point to protect in the new SDN paradigm. It could be vulnerable to attacks that are common in traditional networks such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS). In this paper, we address a type of attack that could threaten the operation of SDN-based environments: poisoning attacks.To perform its function, the logically centralised controller must have an accurate view of the network state. The accuracy of this view is crucial to the operation of the network. This view is obtained by exchanging information among controllers and between controllers and network elements. Such information flow could be vulnerable to different types of poisoning attacks. The motivation for writing this paper is that (1) poisoning attacks on SDN networks could have great impact, (2) most of them are relatively recent and (3) the differences between such attacks could be subtle. Therefore, we address the issues by classifying poisoning attacks in SDN. We classify both attacks and defences. For attacks we make a distinction between direct poisoning attacks and attacks that are designed to evade a specific defence."

Ensuring a smooth surface can help in maintaining stable resistance .","Recent advances in fused filament fabrication (FFF), such as five-axis printing, patching existing parts, and certain hybrid manufacturing processes, involve printing atop a previously manufactured polymer substrate. The success of these technologies depends upon the bond strength between the substrate and the newly added geometry. ANOVA and response surface methods were used to determine the effect of three process parameters on bond tensile strength: surface roughness, layer thickness, and raster angle. Experimental results indicate that the process-property relationships are not identical to those found in single, continuous FFF operations, and that the physical bonding mechanisms may also be different. Bond strength was found to be highly sensitive to surface roughness and layer thickness, and distinct optimal parameter settings exist. These results represent a first step toward understanding bond strength in such circumstances, allowing manufacturers to intelligently select process parameters for the production of both the substrate and the secondary geometry."

[3]: Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has recently been receiving increasing recognition in policy debates. Various aspects of possible regulatory frameworks for its implementation are beginning to be discussed in Europe. One of the issues associated with the wide use of CCS is that it requires the establishment of a carbon dioxide (CO <inf>2</inf>) transport network, which could result in the spatial restructuring of power generation and transmission systems. This poses a significant coordination problem necessitating public planning and regulation. This paper provides a survey over multiple research strands on CCS, particularly energy system modeling and spatial optimization, pertaining to the efficient installment of CCS-related infrastructure throughout Europe. It integrates existing findings and highlights the factors that determine policy coordination needs for a potential wide implementation of CCS in the next decades. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."
s_68,"Comparative Studies: Evaluating different machine learning methods like Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, Neural Networks, and Classification and Regression Trees for phishing email detection .","There are many applications available for phishing detection. However, unlike predicting spam, there are only few studies that compare machine learning techniques in predicting phishing. The present study compares the predictive accuracy of several machine learning methods including Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests (RF), and Neural Networks (NNet) for predicting phishing emails. A data set of 2889 phishing and legitimate emails is used in the comparative study. In addition, 43 features are used to train and test the classifiers.
[4]: Phishing is a rapidly increasing threat to the modern internet where phisher mimics a legit web-page to get user into the phishers cage. The aim of phisher is to get sensitive records or information about the user such as credit card details, email and passwords. Anti-Phishing Working Group recently reported that 86,276 unique phishing URLs have been detected in the month of September, 2019. Thus, to resolve this threat, different methods and techniques have been proposed such as blacklist, whitelist, heuristics of URL, content based, image processing as well as Machine Learning based. Machine Learning (ML) is a modern technique and its algorithms have better efficiency, accuracy and performance. Thus, this paper critically reviews and evaluates Machine Learning based classifiers on the basis of datasets used, feature extraction techniques and performance measures used for the detection of phishing URLs. Moreover, the literature review reveals that every ML base approach has its advantages and limitations; hence, suggesting one classifier over other is challenging. However, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are mainly used classifiers in the literature of this study, where RF achieved the highest accuracy using larger dataset. In contrast, SVM achieved the second highest accuracy using smaller dataset. This research concludes that RF is an efficient approach for the detection of phishing URLs. Finally, insights are provided at the critical evaluation section and this research proposed extracted features that can enhance the literature in order to develop an effective URL phishing detection method."

A frugal ecosystem is an entrepreneurial ecosystem usually found in the developing world and is highly constrained by resources, poor infrastructure, and scarcity. Therefore, firms focus on low-cost, sustainable, and social innovation to succeed. Using a case study approach, the chapter provides insights from two frugal digital platform ecosystems in India: 1) the JobMatch platform that is used to orchestrate informal, low-skilled job seekers, connecting them with potential employers; 2) the IGG platform that orchestrates a community of waste management workers to integrate them into the recycling ecosystem of the city.

[6]: The paper presents the ideas generated by a Romanian Research project ""Knowledge management architecture in environmental, social and economic areas, designed to support the sustainable regional development strategy "", financed under the national research budget. One major result of the project is represented by the development of a regional virtual platform as a driver for knowledge management and innovation. This virtual environment creates a space for integrating and articulating ideas and innovative solutions in a wide participative way. The platform represents an integrator and mediator for the regional business environment and main stakeholders, as well as a connectivity channel for bridging other European and world networks and clusters. The global knowledge economy creates new challenges for the industrial space from at least two perspectives: the development of knowledge products and services, and the increased enterprises' connectivity through complex networks integrating dynamic clusters. The enterprises have to cope with the quick technological changes, with complex organizational systems and with global networking requirements. Consequently, the major enterprise's needs focus on innovation, in order to increase competitiveness in a sustainable way. In this context, the increased accessibility to the new technologies and innovative solutions, as well as the capacity to generate knowledge and innovation represent the major intangible assets of the global enlerprise.The most of the industries, including the metallurgy, are already connected in networks of organizations, technologies, products and consumers, ensuring their visibility and interactions on the market. The capacity of increasing the partnerships and various associations represent a major success factor of the actual global enterprise. In the same time, the enterprises are concerned more about the global perspective than about the local one, and consequently have not always strong links with the local development. In this new perspective, the research team identified the gap between the local administration and the regional actors related to the sustainable regional development and proposed the use of advanced ICT tools for creating a regional virtual platform for supporting the networking among the regional stakeholders and facilitating the development of regional knowledge base, for the benefit of the regional sustainable development. In this perspective, the business actors are more sensitive to the local environmental, economic and social issues, and could contribute to the regional strategy design, as main regional stakeholders.

For instance, nickel-based composites with graphite and MoS2 have shown improved tribological properties .","Nickel-based graphite-containing composites were prepared by powder metallurgy method. Their mechanical properties at room temperature and friction and wear properties from room temperature to 600 °C were investigated by a pin-on-disk tribometer with alumina, silicon nitride and nickel-based alloy as counterfaces. The effects of graphite addition amount, temperature, load, sliding speed and counterface materials on the tribological properties were discussed. The micro-structure and worn surface morphologies were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) attached with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). The results show that the composites are mainly consisted of nickel-based solid solution, free graphite and carbide formed during hot pressing. The friction and wear properties of composites are all improved by adding 6-12 wt.% graphite while the anti-bending and tensile strength as well as hardness decrease after adding graphite. The friction coefficients from room temperature to 600 °C decrease with the increase of load, sliding speed while the wear rates increase with the increasing temperature, sliding speed. The lower friction coefficients and wear rates are obtained when the composite rubs against nickel-based alloy containing molybdenum disulfide. Friction coefficients of graphite-containing composites from room temperature to 600 °C are about 0.4 while wear rates are in the magnitude of 10<sup>-5</sup> mm<sup>3</sup>/(N m). At high temperature, the graphite is not effective in lubrication due to the oxidation and the shield of 'glaze' layer formed by compacting back-transferred wear particles. EDS analysis of worn surface shows that the oxides of nickel and molybdenum play the main role of lubrication instead of graphite at the temperature above 400 °C. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

i_1301,"** Educational Programs: ** Programs like the ""Wellness Initiative"" in Sweden, which educate patients about lifestyle changes post-myocardial infarction, have been successful in promoting smoking cessation .","Background: Modification of risk factors such as smoking, obesity, physical inactivity, and hypertension after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) has been shown to reduce mortality and morbidity. Therefore, most hospitals in Sweden invite patients with myocardial infarction to an educational program, the ""Heart School,"" where they can learn about lifestyle changes. Whether this kind of education program applied in routine care increases the proportion of patients achieving secondary prevention goals is unknown. Methods: A cohort of consecutive patients treated for AMI and included in a quality registry was followed up during 1 year. The main aim was to study the effects of taking part in the Heart School on smoking habits, blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, exercise habits, cardiac symptoms, quality of life, and readmissions to hospital. Patients included in the national quality register of secondary prevention after AMI who had participated in the educational program were compared with those who had not participated in the program. Achievements of secondary prevention goals 1 year after the myocardial infarction were evaluated. The study included 2,822 patients. Results: The result showed that patients who participated in the Heart School stopped smoking more often than those who did not participate (adjusted odds ratio, 2.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-2.78). The Heart School had no effects on the other variables that were examined. Conclusion: The interventions currently used in the Swedish Heart School seem to be insufficient to obtain sustainable lifestyle changes, except for smoking cessation. © 2009 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins."
s_1430,"Tannins: Maintained or possibly improved milk production levels while reducing methane emissions, suggesting a significant benefit to dairy farming practices .","Dairy cows are responsible for significant emissions of enteric methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and produce nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) and ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>) gas from manure. As an abatement strategy, we explored the effects of long-term condensed tannin (Quebracho and chestnut extracts) addition to dairy cow diets. Previous studies have demonstrated that tannins in cow diets reduce methane and ammonia efflux, but none have done so over a >1-month time period. A modified stanchion barn equipped with gas analysis instrumentation measured CH<inf>4</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, and NH<inf>3</inf> fluxes into and from the barn, at the onset of the experiment, and 45 and 90 days after feeding groups of lactating dairy cows a control diet or two levels of tannin extract at 0.45 and 1.8 % of dietary dry matter. Few statistical differences among treatments were observed, likely a consequence of high variability and low sample size necessary for conducting a study of this duration. However, on a per-cow basis, low and high tannin diets lowered CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by 56 g cow<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> and by 48 g cow day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Diet tannin additions lowered CH<inf>4</inf> (33 %), NH<inf>3</inf> (23 %), and N<inf>2</inf>O (70 %) per unit milk corrected emissions in the high tannin treatment compared to the control at the end of the experiment, without significant loss in milk production. These results suggest that relatively low concentrations of diet tannin additions can reduce ruminant CH<inf>4</inf> and gaseous N emissions from manure. The tannin effect observed after 90 days is a starting point for considering tannin additions as a potential long-term strategy for improving the environmental footprint of milk production."
s_1706,"Spectroscopic Techniques: Visible to Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (vis/NIRS): Description: This method is often considered superior to all traditional methods due to its simplicity and rapidity, making it the best choice for all applications in sugar analysis .","The determination and quantification of sugars is important for quality control and assurance of horticultural produce. This review discusses analytical methods for determination of sugars and sweetness of fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, including the use of destructive and non-destructive instrumental techniques to evaluate sugar composition and characterize taste profile or sweetness. From the standard hand-held refractometer to the hydrometer, electronic tongue and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with different detectors, a wide range of devices have been used to determine sugar composition and sweetness of many fruit and vegetable products. Although chromatographic techniques are very accurate and useful, they require extensive sample preparation based on solvent extraction and hence are generally time-consuming and expensive. Visible to near infrared spectroscopy (vis/NIRS) has been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional methods due to its rapidity, simplicity, cost effectiveness and potential for routine analysis if proper calibration and validation steps were developed. Current trends favour analytical methods that are simple to use, quick and non-destructive. The prospects for using emerging technologies such as hyperspectral imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance for non-destructive assessment of sugar content and sweetness of fresh and processed horticultural food products are also discussed."
s_585,"1. Use of Hard Coatings: Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) and Chromium Nitride (CrN): These coatings can significantly reduce wear when applied to sliding contacts. However, it is important to note that the effectiveness can vary depending on the type of lubricant used .","Hard coatings and surface adsorptive/reactive lubricants are two common strategies for improving wear protection, but what if they are used together? In this study, steel-steel and steel-coating sliding was investigated in boundary lubrication of polar and non-polar oils containing a ZDDP or an ionic liquid. Two hard coatings, diamond-like-carbon (DLC) and chromium nitride (CrN), were used. For a steel-steel contact, wear was effectively reduced by using a more surface reactive lubricant, as expected. However, the steel ball wear was increased against a hard coating and further worsened with a more polar oil and/or a more surface reactive additive. The wear mechanism is proposed as a combined effect of physicochemical interactions with the lubricant, mechanical polishing by the counterface, and material adhesion."
s_1626,6. DNA Barcoding: COI Gene: DNA barcoding using the COI gene can be employed for identifying indicator species of aquatic organisms. This method has been used successfully in ecological investigations and can be adapted for seaweed identification .,"Nowadays various methods are used for estimation of ecological state of water bodies; the method of bioindication is one of them. Identification of indicator species of aquatic organisms via the visual method with the aid of a microscope may be performed with a high degree of certainty only by highly experienced zoologists. This method requires deep knowledge of morphological description of every organism, which includes approximately from 15 to 25 characteristics, thus the method greatly depends on subjectiveness of an investigator. At the same time the known methods of molecular genetics are used for determination of the taxonomy of organisms but have not been still used in ecological investigations of water bodies. The method of DNA barcoding which was used by us for identification of indicator species of zooplankton in freshwater bodies in the city of Kazan is one of such molecular methods. The experiment resulted in sequence analysis of the four base sequences of COI gene fragments which were added to the GenBank international database under the following unique numbers: Scapholeberismucronata - HQ336794 (658 bp), Moinamicrura - HQ336797 (658 bp), Mesocyclopsleuckarti - HQ336795 (658 bp), Brachionuscalyciflorus - HQ336793 (660 bp).

i_2021,"Although Thlaspi caerulescens had a higher Cd concentration in its shoots, tobacco's greater biomass led to more efficient overall Cd removal .","Phytoremediation has attracted much more attention in environmental cleanup. The relatively low biomass and slow growth of metal hyperaccumulators restrict the efficiency of phytoextraction of heavy metals using these plants. The objective of this study was to compare the efficiency of phytoextraction of cadmium (Cd) with the hyperaccumulator Thlaspi caerulescens and three high biomass plant species (India mustard, tobacco and sunflower). A pot experiment was conducted using a soil contaminated with Cd (2. 87 mg-kg<sup>-1</sup>) from past application of manure and fertilizer with Cd for long time. The results showed that the Thlaspi caerulescens had a higher ability of Cd accumulation than other three plants species. The Cd concentration in the shoots of Thlaspi caerulescens reached 43.7 mg-kg<sup>-1</sup>, whereas only 1.7 mg-kg <sup>-1</sup>Cd was found in the shoots of sunflower. Cd concentration in the shoots of Thlaspi caerulescens was 10, 27 and 56 times of that of tobacco, Indian mustard, and sunflower, respectively. However, tobacco had the highest biomass, which was 35, 3 and 2 times of Thlaspi caerulescens, Indian mustard and sunflower, respectively. Total uptake of Cd from the soil was 117, 35, 30 and 10 ±g'pot<sup>-1</sup> for tobacco, Thlaspi caerulescens, India mustard and sunflower, respectively. Phytoextracion efficiency was 1%, 0.6%, 0.5% and 0.08% for tobacco, Thlaspi caerulescens, India mustard and sunflower, respectively. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in either total or extractable Cd concentration in the soil after the four plant species were harvested."

s_720,Additional Considerations: Material Selection: The choice of conductive material is critical. Different commercial conductive materials exhibit varying levels of resistance and sensitivity to mechanical and thermal stresses .,"Nowadays, a challenging scenario involving additive manufacturing (AM), or 3D printing, relates to concerns on the manufacturing of electronic devices. In particular, the possibility of using fused filament fabrication (FFF) technology, which is well known for being very widespread and inexpensive, to fabricate structures with embedded sensing elements, is really appealing. Several researchers in this field have highlighted the high electrical resistance values and variability in 3D-printed strain sensors made via FFF. It is important to find a way to minimize the electrical resistance and variability among strain sensors printed under the same conditions for several reasons, such as reducing the measurement noise and better balancing four 3D-printed strain gauges connected to form a Wheatstone bridge to obtain better measurements. In this study, a design of experiment (DoE) on 3D-printed strain gauges, studying the relevance of printing and design parameters, was performed. Three different commercial conductive materials were analyzed, including a total of 105 printed samples. The output of this study is a combination of parameters which allow both the electrical resistance and variability to be minimized; in particular, it was discovered that the ""welding effect"" due to the layer height and printing orientation is responsible for high values of resistance and variability. After the optimization of printing and design parameters, further experiments were performed to characterize the sensitivity of each specimen to mechanical and thermal stresses, highlighting an interesting aspect. A sensible variation of the electrical resistance at room temperature was observed, even if no stress was applied to the specimen, suggesting the potential of exploiting these materials for the 3D printing of highly sensitive temperature sensors."

Simple, manual exchange and automated exchange can be effective in reducing the acute and chronic complications of SCD, and the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology mean they all have a role in different situations. Evidence for the role of emergency transfusion in the management of the acute complications of SCD, including acute pain and acute chest syndrome, comes from observational data. Several important randomized controlled trials have shown the efficacy of transfusion in primary and secondary stroke prevention in patients with SCD but, outside these areas, clinical practice lacks a clear evidence base. Evidence for the role of long-term transfusion in the prevention of the non-neurologic chronic complications of SCD comes from analysis of secondary outcomes of these randomized trials and from observational data. In view of the paucity of data, the risks and benefits of transfusion should be fully discussed with patients/families before a long-term transfusion program is commenced. Evidence is only available for the role of preoperative transfusion or for prophylactic transfusion through pregnancy in certain situations, and the role of transfusions outside these situations is discussed. Questions about when and how to transfuse in SCD remain and will need further randomized trials to provide answers."

[10]: Microseismic source location (MSL) provides crucial information for the interpretation of rock mass stability and early warning of rock mass hazards. The accuracy of MSL mainly depends on the formation of the sensor array, the multi-velocity model, and the locating algorithm. Especially, the choice of algorithm plays a decisive role, which requires both optimal accuracy and efficiency for searching the global optimal solution. In this paper, an advanced heuristic algorithm, Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), is applied for MSL in tunnel engineering. A standard framework of the GSA-based searching process is first built. Its accuracy, stability, and speed of convergence are rigorously compared and analyzed with particle swarm optimization and simplex algorithm using synthetic and real microseismic data. Four types of equivalent velocity models are combined with the searching algorithm to further discuss the applicability and performance of GSA in different situations. The studies show that for all the cases, GSA has the highest speed of convergence with the best accuracy. Locating errors are controlled within 10 m, which fulfills the requirement of engineering accuracy. A representative case study is conducted using microseismic data prior to a major rockburst in a twin-tube highway tunnel. The calculated cluster of seismic events using GSA-based algorithm well matches the actual unstable areas. This work indicates that GSA is an optimal algorithm for microseismic source location and rockburst warning in tunneling."

Methods: ECOVIR was a prospective study aiming to assess whether in patients on combination ART with ≥4 antiretrovirals for ≥24 weeks and virally suppressed for ≥48 weeks, a drug-reduced (DR) regimen could be proposed. The intervention consisted of discontinuing genotypically less susceptible drugs to reach a DR regimen with ≤3 antiretrovirals. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients maintaining viral suppression at week (W) 24. Results: From 89 eligible individuals for the study, a DR regimen was proposed in 86 (97%) patients, of whom 71 were switched to a DR regimen. Baseline characteristics [median (IQR)] were: age 58 (53-65) years, duration of treatment 24 (21-26) years and viral suppression 8 (6-11) years. The cumulative resistance profile showed full resistance to lamivudine/emtricitabine (91%), abacavir (74%), efavirenz/nevirapine (70%), rilpivirine (56%), darunavir (q24h/q12h) (42%/29%), lopinavir (69%), atazanavir (71%) and raltegravir (24%). The final DR regimen consisted of a two-drug or three-drug regimen in 54 patients (76%) and in 17 patients (24%), respectively. The success rate of a DR regimen at W24 was 93.9% (95% CI 84.4-97.6, Kaplan-Meier estimate). Four patients experienced virological failure (at W4, W8 and W12), all with plasma viral load (pVL) <600 copies/mL and no emergence of resistance mutations. The DR strategy allowed a monthly cost saving of 36%. Conclusions: In experienced patients with high-level resistance, individualized strategies based on expert advice can offer DR regimen options with fewer drug-drug interactions and a significant economic impact while ensuring virological success.

s_1478,"Considerations: Environmental Impact: The use of herbicides and pesticides has no significant environmental implications, and they do not affect non-target species or soil properties.

Mill) survival and growth, net nitrogen mineralization, and soil microbial biomass, were evaluated after four growing seasons in a Florida wet flatwoods site following chemical vegetation control during the first year or second year after planting, or during both years. The four herbicide treatments included sulfometuron methyl at 0.26 ai kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, hexazinone (0.56 ai kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), sulfometuron (0.26 ai kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) plus hexazinone (0.56 ai kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) mix, and imazapyr at 0.21 ai kg ha<sup>-1</sup>. Imazapyr was the only treatment to significantly improve growth over the control in a single application. Consecutive annual applications of imazapyr and hexazinone on seedlings also improved growth rates compared to the control. Sulfometuron methyl-treated pine trees had lower survival rates and were smaller than pines growing in the control plots after a single application. The survival and growth rates of imazapyr-treated seedlings were improved when the chemical was applied during the second growing season after planting, instead of the first year. Imazapyr and hexazinone applications increased net nitrogen mineralization rates, but imazapyr was the only treatment to increase ammonification; compared to the control. Microbial and fungal biomass carbon showed no differences between treatments. The results did show that microbial biomass significantly increased with two consecutive years of herbicide applications over a single application.

i_2045,"Environmental Cues and Habitat Selection. Water Movement and Connectivity: The movement of water can impact the dispersal of eggs and larvae. In reservoirs, altered hydrodynamics can completely prevent the downstream movement of fish eggs and larvae, which inevitably leads to the failure of all migratory species to reproduce successfully .","Fish ladders are generally conceived to reestablish connectivity among critical habitats for migratory species, thus mitigating the impacts of the blockage of migration routes by dams. If this management tool is to be meaningful for conserving fish species, it must provide a fully permeable connection and assure both upward and downward movements. However, because reservoirs have very different hydrodynamics than the original river, it is expected that, at least in the inner area, they may constitute an additional barrier to this movement, especially for descending fish. Thus, the present study sought to determine if migratory fish and their offspring disperse downstream from the dam after ascending a ladder and spawning in the upper reaches of a basin. To achieve this purpose, we evaluated the limitation imposed by lentic areas to the descent of eggs, larvae and adults of migratory species; we also determined the abundance and composition of larvae present in the plankton near the dam, and compared the intensity of the upward and downward movements of adult fish. Samples of ichthyoplankton were taken upriver, inside the reservoir, in the river downstream from the dam, and in the forebay of the Lajeado Dam on the Tocantins River (Luis Eduardo Magalhães Hydroelectric Plant), from October, 1999 through September, 2004. The densities of fish ascending and descending the ladder were determined experimentally on eight occasions, from June, 2004 to March, 2005. Due to difficulties in identifying the true fish origin (up or down) in the environments connected by the fish passage system, the evaluation of the distribution of migratory fish in reservoirs was based on the landings of the commercial fishery conducted along the Itaipu Reservoir during the four years preceding (2001 through 2003) the construction of the lateral channel (fish-passage mechanism). Fish eggs and larvae drifting down the Tocantins River did not appear in samples taken in the lower half of the reservoir; those found in water flowing through the spillways, turbines or fish ladder of Lajeado Dam belonged essentially to non-migratory clupeids that spawn in the inner part of the reservoir. In addition, results showed that in a reservoir with no fish-passage mechanism, migrants select habitats that still maintain riverine characteristics, in the upper parts of the impounded area. The downward movements are negligible compared to those upward, in the experiments conducted in the fish ladder. It is concluded, therefore, that the Lajeado fish ladder, and possibly those at other dams, is essentially a one-way route that promotes upstream movements of migrants, without the necessary return of adults or their offspring. Thus, the low permeability of the connections provided by these management tools can drastically increase the level of environmental impact that they were actually intended to reduce.

i_1744,Lower precipitation levels leading to water stress and reduced vegetation vigor .,"Precipitation is one of the important factors that influences vegetation growth and distributions. Using GF-1 remotely sensed images and observed precipitation data, this paper discusses the response relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the standardized precipitation index (SPI) in Hutubi County at different time scales from January to December, 2014. The results show that: (1) From a macro point of view, NDVI has obvious geographical characteristics, the Central Plains region has the highest NDVI values; whereas mountains and hills in the southern region and deserts in the northern region have relatively low NDVI values. (2) There is a clear changing trend in the area of vegetation cover. (3) The SPI randomness decreases but the SPI persistence increases with increment in time scales. The sensitivity of the SPI to precipitation is different at different time scales. (4) The SPI has a good correlation with NDVI at six-months time scale. (5)The overall distributions of both basically have the same shape and trendwithhigher SPI values in April and May, and higher NDVI are from June to August. This confirms the lag-time of precipitation influence on vegetation.
[4]: Changes in precipitation patterns were expected to have strong impacts on temperate ecosystem dynamics. North China has experienced opposite trends of precipitation change (increased in the west and decreased in the east) in the past several decades. Under such a background, we analysed mean growing season (GS) (April-October) grass Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) changes using combined dataset of Global Inventory, Monitoring, and Modelling Studies and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI in North China during 1982-2011. The results showed that in mean GS NDVI increased for grasslands in both Northeastern China (NE) and Northwestern China (NW). Increase in NDVI in NW was mainly due to the increase in precipitation (r = 0.50, p < 0.01). However, the decrease in precipitation did not cause a decrease in grass NDVI in NE, suggesting that precipitation is still higher than the most sensitive value and NDVI changes were significantly correlated with the increased temperature (r = 0.43, p < 0.05)."

Cloud based systems are effective in storage and application of machine learning algorithms on such datasets. However, in some cases it is important to enable real time processing for making immediate decisions. There are many applications which require instantaneous analysis of the generated data for remedies in event of an anomaly.

Various electronic sensors, e.g. Temperature, Moisture, Air Quality, Pressure, Wind Velocity etc. present in a Wireless Sensor Network generate streams of values. It can be processed using pipelines which provide prompt and quick analysis for decision making. Stream Processing Systems can be helpful in such cases as they analyse data streams within a few milliseconds to a few seconds. In this paper, we discuss an event based processing of streaming data from air pollution sensors to create a real time anomaly detection system. To reduce the delays associated with the generation of alarms in our pipeline, Apache Foundation's Stream Processing Tools, Kafka and Flink were used for operations on our streams.

In addition, these characteristics by facilitating the collection of big amounts of test data over the web render our game an ideal device for both monitoring learner performance in dependence on situational context factors and for comparing different teaching methodologies."
i_1467,"However, I can offer some general insights based on related information from the abstracts: Catheter Fragments and Embolism: Several abstracts discuss the embolization of catheter fragments, which can provide some context. For instance, catheter fragments as long as 11.6 cm have been reported to cause embolism and require removal to prevent complications . This suggests that foreign objects of significant length and rigidity, such as catheter fragments, can indeed cause embolism.","Embolization of a catheter fragment is a very rarely seen complication, and few cases have been reported in children. Catheter fragments must be urgently extracted due to life-threatening complications. Most catheter fragments are removed very soon after being lost in the cardiovascular system, including the venous system and right side of the heart. In our report, we describe a child with catheter fragment, which was removed from the left ventricle 32 days after embolization. This catheter fragment was successfully retrieved percutaneously using a gooseneck snare catheter through the femoral artery.
[2]: Venous catheters are important therapeutic devices for the administration of fluid and chemotherapeutic agents; however, their use may be associated with serious complications, such as catheter rupture and embolism. Most data on port catheter embolization consist of isolated case reports; only a few studies have examined a large number of patients with port catheter embolism. The purpose of this study was to identify the incidence of clinical symptoms in patients with catheter dislocation and to determine the role of catheter fragment localization in combination with the presenting symptoms. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Martin-Luther University Hospital Center from January 1994 to September 2005. In total, 41 patients with centrally dislocated catheter fragments were analyzed. Most catheter fragments were located in the pulmonary artery, superior vena cava, and right atrium. Of the patients in whom the catheter fragments were located in the right atrium, right ventricle, and the pulmonary artery, 7.3% presented cardiac symptoms. Catheter malfunction occurred in 39%. In 53.7%, catheter embolism was found incidentally. The embolized catheter fragments were retrieved by a goose-neck snare under fluoroscopy within 24 hours after the diagnosis without any complications. The mean length of these fragments was 11.6 cm. Catheter embolism may go undiagnosed for a prolonged period and be found incidentally. In these patients, predominantly local symptoms occur; however, severe systemic clinical signs may develop. The risk of serious complications in asymptomatic catheter embolism is unknown. Catheter fragments should be removed to prevent further complications. © 2008 Sage Publications.
[3]: Background: Detachment and embolization (DE) is a rare complication of totally implantable central venous access devices (TIVADs). This study aimed to analyze clinical findings, etiology, and treatment options in DE of TIVADs. Methods: Patients who experienced DE between 2010–2019 were included. Indications, implantation techniques, time to diagnosis, patient complaints, diagnostic methods, rupture site, location of embolization, treatment methods, and chest X-rays prior to detachment were analyzed retrospectively. Results: DE of TIVAD was detected in 12(1.2%) patients. Eleven patients had breast cancer and one had colon cancer. Mean age at implantation was 45.3 ± 9.6(31–61.3) years. Seven (58%) patients were asymptomatic, four (33.3%) had TIVAD malfunction, and one (8.3%) had pain and swelling at port site after injection. Mean time from implantation to diagnosis was 1149.92(16–2795) days. The etiologies comprised Pinch-off Syndrome (POS) in eight (66%) patients, detachment directly adjacent to the lock mechanism in three (25%) patients, and probable iatrogenic injury during explantation in one (9%) patient. The most common site of embolism was the superior vena cava (25%). While the embolized fragment was removed percutaneously in 11 patients, medical follow-up was treatment choice for one patient. Conclusions: DE is a rare complication with an incidence rate of 1.2% in this study. Since most patients were asymptomatic, chest radiography plays an important role in diagnosis. The most common cause was POS, and it can be prevented by inserting the catheter from lateral third of the clavicle during subclavian vein catheterization. The first-choice treatment was percutaneous femoral retrieval. However, if not technically possible, alternative treatment options are thoracotomy or follow-up with anticoagulant therapy."
i_457,Reduce Costs: Minimize the expenses associated with traditional voting methods .,"E-Voting has become a very controversially discussed topic during the last few years. Primarily caused by the fact of decreasing voter participation, some politicians regard e-voting as the magic bullet. Although IT experts and data privacy specialists disapprove of it, e-voting will be introduced during the upcoming Austrian Students' Union polls in early 2009. All advantages of e-voting, like an increased turnout of voters due to additional voting channels or cost reduction, have already been rebutted by a number of studies. Critics also strongly emphasize the disadvantages of electronic elections, such as violating the principles of electoral law as well as the loss of transparency of the voting process. © Springer-Verlag 2009.
[9]: Current electronic voting systems mostly relied on central server and the trusted third party, this kind system architecture increases the security risks of voting, and even makes voting fail. In order to solve this issue, an electronic voting system BFV-blockchainvoting that supported BFV homomorphic encryption was proposed, and this system applied the blockchain technology to the electronic voting system to replace the trusted third party. Firstly, an open and transparent bulletin board was used to record the vote information, and an intelligent contract was used to realize the functions of verification and self counting. Secondly, in order to further improve the security and reliability of the voting process, the voter's registration information was signed by SM2 signature algorithm, the ballot was managed by both parties that can supervise each other, and the counting data was encrypted by the BFV full homomorphic encryption algorithm. Finally, the evaluation of performance shows that it only costs 1.69 ms to complete one ballot in the proposed electronic voting system. This electronic voting scheme based on the BFV full homomorphic encryption and blockchain has better security attributes such as manipulation-resistance, anonymity, verifiability, double-voting resistance, coercion-resistance and resistance to quantum attacks. The scheme is suitable for a variety of voting scenarios and can meet the efficiency requirements in large voting scenarios."

In this case it was Cry1F-expressing maize (Mycogen 2A517). The ladybird beetle, Coleomegilla maculata, is a common and abundant predator that suppresses pest populations in maize and many other cropping systems. Its larvae and adults are polyphagous, feeding on aphids, thrips, lepidopteran eggs and larvae, as well as plant tissues. Thus, C. maculata may be exposed to Bt proteins expressed in genetically engineered crops by several pathways. Using Cry1F-resistant S. frugiperda larvae as prey, we evaluated the potential impact of Cry1F-expressing maize on several fitness parameters of C. maculata over two generations. Using Cry1F resistant prey removed any potential prey-mediated effects. Duration of larval and pupal stages, adult weight and female fecundity of C. maculata were not different when they were fed resistant S. frugiperda larvae reared on either Bt or control maize leaves during both generations. ELISA and insect-sensitive bioassays showed C. maculata were exposed to bioactive Cry1F protein. The insecticidal protein had no effect on C. maculata larvae, even though larvae contained 20-32 ng of Cry1F/g by fresh weight. Over all, our results demonstrated that the Cry1F protein did not affect important fitness parameters of one of S. frugiperda's major predators and that Cry1F protein did not accumulate but was strongly diluted when transferred during trophic interactions. © 2012 The Author(s). [10] For a devastating agricultural pest, functional genomics promotes the finding of novel technology to control Spodoptera frugiperda, such as the genetics-based strategies. In the present study, 11 yellow genes were identified in Spodoptera frugiperda. The transcriptome analysis showed the tissue-specific expression of part yellow genes, which suggested the importance of yellow genes in some biological processes in S. frugiperda, such as pigmentation. Among these yellow genes, the expression profiles of yellow-y gene showed that it was expressed in all life stages. In order to realize the further study of yellow-y, we employed CRISPR/Cas9 system to knock out this gene. Following knock out, diverse phenotypes were observed, such as color changes in both larvae and adults. Different from the wild-type larvae and adults, G<inf>0</inf> mutants were yellowed since hatching. However, no color difference was observed with the pupal cuticle between the wild-type and mutant pupae before the 8th day. On the basis of the single-pair strategy of G0 generation, the yellow-y gene was proved to be a recessive gene. The G1 yellowish larvae with biallelic mutations displayed a relatively longer development period than wild-type, and often generated abnormal pupae and moths. The deletion of yellow-y also resulted in a decline in the fecundity. The results revealed that yellow-y gene was important for S. frugiperda pigmentation, as well as in its development and reproduction. Besides, the present study set up a standard procedure to knock out genes in S. frugiperda, which could be helpful for our understanding some key molecular processes, such as functional roles of detoxification genes as insecticide resistance mechanisms or modes of action of insecticides to facilitate the management of this insect pest."

Technological and Agricultural Innovations: Microbial-Based Products: Utilizing beneficial microorganisms in the rhizosphere can improve plant health and productivity, reducing the need for chemical inputs .","To feed a world population, which will reach 9.7 billion in 2050, agricultural production will have to increase by 35–56%. Therefore, more food is urgently needed. Yield improvements for any given crop would require adequate fertilizer, water, and plant protection from pests and disease, but their further abuse will be economically disadvantageous and will have a negative impact on the environment. Using even more agricultural inputs is simply not possible, and the availability of arable land will be increasingly reduced due to climate changes. To improve agricultural production without further consumption of natural resources, farmers have a powerful ally: The beneficial microorganisms inhabiting the rhizosphere. However, to fully exploit the benefits of these microorganisms and therefore to widely market microbial-based products, there are still gaps that need to be filled, and here we will describe some critical issues that should be better addressed."

i_1401,"Comparative Data: Key Points: New Zealand's Trends: While specific incidence rates per 100,000 children in New Zealand are not detailed, there is evidence of a significant increase in childhood brain tumor cases over time .","Introduction: Childhood brain tumours (CBTs) are the second most common type of cancer in individuals aged 0–24 years globally and cause significant morbidity and mortality. CBT aetiology remains poorly understood, however previous studies found higher CBT incidence in high-income countries (HIC) compared to low-middle income countries (LMIC), suggesting a positive relationship between incidence and wealth. Materials & methods: Aggregated data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5) were used to explore CBT epidemiology. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) compared CBT rates between twenty-five geographically and economically diverse countries. The relationship between incidence and economic development was explored using linear regression models and Spearman's rank correlation tests. Trends in CBT incidence between 1978 and 2012 were investigated using average annual percentage changes (AAPC). Results: CBT incidence was highest in North America and lowest in Africa. CBT incidence rates increased significantly with increasing GDP per capita (p = 0.006). Gini index was significantly negatively associated with CBT incidence. Incidence decreased with increasing income inequality within countries, indicated by higher Gini indices (p = 0.040). Increasing and decreasing CBT incidence trends were observed within individual countries, although only Italy (p = 0.02) and New Zealand (p < 0.005) experienced statistically significant changes over time. Conclusions: The excess disease found in HIC may be explained by environmental risk factor exposure increasing CBT risk in wealthy populations. However, systematic limitations of substandard cancer detection and reporting in LMIC may mean incidence disparities result from misinformation bias rather than genuine differences in risk factor exposure. Further research is required to comprehensively describe CBT epidemiology and explain study findings."

s_1086,"Key Points: Paraneoplastic Syndromes and Ovarian Cancer: Paraneoplastic syndromes are rare disorders triggered by an immune response to a malignancy. They can affect various systems, including the nervous system and skin .","Paraneoplastic neurological syndromes (PNS) are defined as distant effects of tumors on the nervous system other than metastasis, direct invasion, and metabolic and vascular effects. Despite being rarely encountered diseases of neurology, they are important as early indicators of systemic cancer. There are rare cases reported in the literature of paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy associated with the development of ovarian malignancy. Our case exhibited positive anti-Yo, ovarian adenocarcinoma, and peripheral neuropathy.
[2]: Paraneoplastic neurologic disorders are rare manifestations of a malignant neoplasm and mostly immune-mediated. Out of a broad spectrum of tumors ovarian and breast carcinomas are frequently the underlying cause presenting a challenge for the gynecologist. The combination of a rapidly progressive severe neurologic disability and a small, as yet unknown tumor is the typical clinical presentation. In addition to the most frequent paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration resulting in severe ataxia, limbic encephalitis, brain stem encephalitis, sensory neuropathy, stiff-person syndrome, dermatomyositis and paraneoplastic retinopathy have been described. The cornerstone for the diagnosis are onconeural antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid reacting with both the nervous system and the underlying cancer. Paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes in women with ovarian or breast cancer imply a grave prognosis. Although antitumor therapy may be effective in many cases and are essential for the success of additional immunotherapy, most patients remain severely disabled and mortality is remarkably high. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.
[3]: Purpose: The aim of the study is to present MRI examinations of the brain and spinal cord, performed in girls with acute severe neurological presentation of paraneoplastic syndrome associated with ovarian teratomas. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is a rare disorder caused by remote effects of malignancy in different organs. The pathogenesis of PNS concerns the autoimmune system and specific antibodies. PNS can be seen as encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, brainstem encephalitis, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. These symptoms are potentially reversible, if the underlying neoplasm is removed. Methods: We presented three girls, aged 13, 17, and 18 years. They were all referred to the hospital because of an acute onset of severe disseminated encephalomyelitis. All MRI exams were performed on a 1.5 T scanner with a routine brain and spinal cord protocol, including TSE T2-WI and FLAIR sequences. In all cases, a contrast agent was injected in the standard dose. Results: Neurological examination performed at the onset of the disease revealed hemiparesis, seizures, and consciousness disturbances. In one girl, visual field loss was also disclosed. They were all healthy before the onset of the disease. Brain and spinal cord MR imaging revealed multiple hyperintense lesions located supratentorially in the white matter of both hemispheres, in the pons, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Patients were treated with methyloprednisolone IV and IVIG. They all improved but significant sequelae were present. Two of them developed symptoms of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy within 2 months after the onset of encephalomyelitis. At the same time, brain MRI showed progression of the lesions. In two patients, anti-Yo antibodies were present in blood. Extensive examinations revealed bilateral ovarian teratomas in two patients, and left-sided ovarian teratoma in one case. Surgical resection of teratomas resulted in rapid clinical improvement. Conclusions: These cases show that in children and adolescents, acute demyelinating disease can be a manifestation of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Thus, PNS should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. In female children and adolescents with suspected PNS, it is important to search for ovarian tumours."

Hormone replacement therapy, indeed, was (and is) effective in preventing fracture, but is no longer to be considered to be a primary indication for this purpose. Thus, while continuing with calcium and vitamin D, drug therapy now consists of the antiresorptive agents: raloxifene, calcitonin, and the bisphosphonates. These drugs reduce bone turnover, and do prevent fractures, but are limited to halting further deterioration of skeletal microarchitecture. The newest agent against osteoporosis is teriparatide, an amino terminal fragment parathyroid hormone containing 34 amino acids. PTH(1-34), or teriparatide, exhibits many of the classical actions of the whole molecule. It is anabolic with respect to bone when used according to well-defined protocols. Bone microarchitecture is restored with increases in cortical thickness and in connectivity.

[18] Objective: To develop an initiative using standardized discharge orders to improve the posthip fracture care of patients aged 50 years or older. Design: Prospective nonrandomized study. Setting: Hospital orthopaedic service. Participants: Patients at our institution older than age 50 years sustaining a hip fracture who were followed for at least 6 months and qualified for osteoporosis medication. Intervention: The endocrinology and orthopaedic areas agreed to add calcium/vitamin D supplementation, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan request, and a consult with endocrinology to the hospital discharge orders. Outcome Measures: The proportions of patients using calcium or bisphosphonate before and after the intervention were compared using the McNemar test. The designated level of significance was 0.05. Results: Originally, 37 of 137 patients were taking calcium/vitamin D supplements. Following this initiative, 92 of 137 were taking the supplement (P < 0.0001). Seventeen of 137 patients were taking bisphosphonate initially and 65 of 137 after the initiative (P < 0.0001). After the initiative, 100% of the discharged patients were offered calcium/vitamin D, a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, and an endocrinology appointment. All of the patients who reported for the endocrinology consult appointment were offered bisphosphonate therapy. Eighty-two patients kept the appointment for the dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan, and 54 saw the endocrinologist. Conclusion: The addition of a calcium/vitamin D supplement and an endocrinology appointment to the hospital discharge orders was an effective method of improving treatment and enhancing compliance.Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

LTBI was assessed by T-SPOT.TB, and information on HCWs was collected using a standardised questionnaire. Risk factors for LTBI were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression. The overall prevalence of LTBI among HCWs was 33.6%. Analyzed by job category, the highest prevalence was found among laboratory staff (43.4%). In the different workplaces, the proportion of LTBI was significantly higher among the high risk workplaces (37.4%) compared to the low risk workplaces. The duration of employment had a significant impact on the prevalence of LTBI.

One of these comorbidities is the metabolic syndrome that is in correlation with abdominal fat thickness and waist circumference. Various methods were used to reduce abdominal fat thickness such as liposuction. A noninvasive method is the topical agent. In this study, we investigated the effectiveness of Arnebia euchroma (AE) ointment on the abdominal fat thickness. Materials and Methods: This study was a double-blind clinical trial which was done at the endocrinology clinic in Khorshid Hospital, Isfahan, Iran, in 2014. After explaining the procedure and obtaining informed consent, the candidates were randomly divided into the case and control groups. The participants of the case and control groups applied AE ointment or placebo for 6 weeks on their abdominal area. Body mass index, waist and buttock circumference, and abdominal fat thickness were measured in both case and control groups at their first visit and then at the next 2, 4, and 6 weeks. We used t-test for comparing parametric variables between groups, paired t-test for changes from baseline to final, and repeated measure ANOVA for changes at different steps. Results: Sixty female candidates participated in this study (thirty in each group). Ten patients left the study and fifty participants finished the trial. At the end of the study, participants had a significant weight loss (2.96 ± 1.6 kg, P < 0.001) that was slightly more in the case group (3.15 ± 1.5 kg vs. 2.75 ± 1.7, P = 0.375). Abdominal circumference also decreased significantly in the participants (11.3 ± 6.7 cm, P < 0.001), but the changes were more significant in the case group (13.9 vs. 6.5 cm, P = 0.004). Similarly, abdominal fat thickness decreased significantly in the participants (2.3 ± 1.1 cm, P < 0.001), although changes were not significantly different between two groups (2.53 vs. 2.04 cm, P = 0.139). Conclusion: Topical AE ointment can reduce the abdominal fat thickness as well as the waist circumference without causing any side effect."
s_17,"Handling Uncertainty: Extend Apache Spark to support uncertainty and fuzziness, which is crucial for applications requiring probabilistic reasoning .","In this paper we describe how the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard enhances the JBoss Drools production rule engine with native support for using predictive models in business rules. The historic debate between symbolic and connectionist approaches to rule/model orchestration provides numerous examples of hybrid systems combining ""hard"" and ""soft"" computing techniques to achieve di-erent levels of integration. Rules are often used to decide when and which model to invoke; model outputs, in turn, can be used to evaluate the preconditions of a rule. In a loosely coupled system, the rule engine calls an external component implementing the predictive model, but this has several disadvantages, most notably the need to setup proper communications and reconcile any di-erence in the way the components encode the data. We propose instead, a tightly integrated system where predictive models and rules become part of the same reasoning framework. The models, encoded using the PMML 4 standard, are loaded and processed by a compiler implemented using the rule engine it-self. The PMML document is transformed into a set of facts that de-ne the model, and a series of rules that formalize the model's behavior. In addition, most PMML data processing, validation, and transformation procedures are also implemented using auto-generated rules. Finally, in oder to integrate model inputs and outputs seamlessly in the inference process, we exploit an extension of the Drools engine which adds native support for uncertainty and/or fuzziness.

They rely on emotional and physical support from informal carers, typically family members. Informal carers have an indispensable role in patient care poststroke, and the ability of carers to manage this role effectively is crucial for stroke survivors to be able to return home. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of the caring role on carers of stroke survivors, particularly the services provided and the levels of depression and well-being experienced. The study used a longitudinal design incorporating survey methods. Stroke survivors were assessed for functional ability, quality of life, and depression using three assessment tools: the Stroke Impact Scale, World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF scale, and Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. A total of 26 people were surveyed: 13 stroke survivors and their 13 carers. Carer knowledge of stroke support services was also explored. Information was collected by using survey methods and structured interviews at 3 weeks and at 3 months postdischarge. The main finding was that depression scores for carers and stroke survivors were below Australian norms at both assessment time points. The major concern identified by carers was poor follow-up procedures for initiating rehabilitation in the home. This study highlighted that a lack of appropriate discharge planning, in conjunction with early discharge of stroke survivors, can have an impact on the rehabilitation process and place increased and unrealistic demands on carers.
[4]: Background. Stroke is still one of most frequent causes of long-term disability. In Poland 68.5% post-stroke survivors requires the assistance of family caregivers during home care. This way stroke affects not only the patients, but theirs families too. Material and methods. A rigorous research was conducted using specified keywords. Representative Polish and abroad literature was sinthesized and discussed. Results. Caregivers problem can significantly influence course and results of the therapy of stroke-survivors. Family caregivers are often unprepared for the demands required of them. Family members may struggle to adapt to a care-giving role, and relationships between stroke survivors and other family members can be altered by the illness. Conclusion. Caregivers of stroke patients report inadequate support, which often do not meet their needs. The findings call for improved standards of health care and welfare, both on the area of patients and caregivers according to their needs. © 2011 Via Medica."
s_1028,"Comparison with Critically Ill Non-Septic Patients: Inflammatory Markers: In critically ill non-septic patients, such as those with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), there is also an increase in CD16 expressing monocytes (both intermediate and nonclassical) compared to healthy controls. However, the proportion of these monocytes decreases with treatment, suggesting a resolution of the acute inflammatory state .","Background Distinct monocyte subsets predict cardiovascular risk and contribute to heart failure progression in murine models, but they have not been examined in clinical acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Methods and Results Blood samples were obtained from 11 healthy control subjects (HCs) and at admission and discharge from 19 ADHF patients. Serologic markers of inflammation were assessed at admission and discharge. Monocyte populations were defined with the use of flow cytometry for cell-surface expression of CD14 and CD16: CD14++CD16- (classic), CD14++CD16+ (intermediate), and CD14+CD16++ (nonclassic). In ADHF patients, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher compared with HCs (both P <.001) and decreased from admission to discharge (CRP: 12.1 ± 10.1 to 8.6 ± 8.4 mg/L [P =.005]; IL-6: 19.8 ± 34.5 to 7.1 ± 4.7 pg/mL [P =.08]). In ADHF patients, the admission proportion of CD14++CD16- monocytes was lower (68% vs 85%; P <.001) and that of CD14++CD16+ (15% vs 8%; P =.002) and CD14+CD16++ (17% vs 7%, P =.07) monocytes higher compared with HCs. Additionally, the proportion of CD14++CD16- monocytes increased (68% to 79%, P =.04) and the CD14+CD16++ monocytes decreased (17% to 7%, P =.049) between admission and discharge. Conclusions Following standard treatment of ADHF, the monocyte profile and circulating inflammatory markers shifts to more closely resemble those of HC, suggesting a resolution of the acute inflammatory state. Functional studies are warranted to understand how specific monocyte subsets and systemic inflammation may contribute to ADHF pathophysiology."
i_251,"Algorithm Steps: Thresholding: Based on the calculated differences, the algorithm determines thresholds to segment the image. This helps in distinguishing different regions within the image, such as edges or textures, and may also enhance the visual quality of the segmented images for better human interpretation .","Thresholding is a popular image segmentation method that often requires as a preliminary and indispensable stage in the computer aided image process, particularly in the analysis of X-ray welding images. In this paper, a modified gray level difference-based transition region extraction and thresholding algorithm is presented for segmentation of the images that have been corrupted by intensity inhomogeneities or noise. Classical gray level difference algorithm is improved by selective output of the result of the maximum or the minimum of the gray level with the pixels in the surrounding, and multi-structuring of neighborhood window is used to represent the essence of transition region. The proposed algorithm could robustly measure the gray level changes, and accurately extract transition region of an image. Comparisons with other approaches demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm. © 2013 Shanghai Jiaotong University and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.
[2]: The searching algorithm of edge grey levels in column and row was proposed. The basic principle of the algorithm is as follows. Starting from the pixel of highest grey level and computing the disparity in grey level of each two adjacent pixels within the same column of image, the grey levels of pixels where the disparity reaches maximum and minimum are taken as the upper and lower thresholds of image edges in that column and that row. Thresholds are searched in each column and row of image. Besides that, the other edge detection algorithm was presented based on golden section, together with multi-threshold and limited area. Computational complexity of new algorithm was analyzed. Experimental results show that new algorithm extracts the edge of thermal image quickly and meets the practical demands of automatic target recognition."
s_25,"AI systems can also identify discrepancies in clinical documentation, such as missed diagnoses, and prompt secondary reviews to ensure accuracy .","Objective: This quality assurance study assessed the implementation of a combined artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) program for pulmonary nodule detection in the emergency department setting. The program was designed to function outside of normal reading workflows to minimize radiologist interruption. Materials and methods: In all, 19,246 CT examinations including at least some portion of the lung anatomy performed in the emergent setting from October 1, 2021, to June 1, 2022, were processed by the combined AI-NLP program. The program used an AI algorithm trained on 6-mm to 30-mm pulmonary nodules to analyze CT images and an NLP to analyze radiological reports. Cases flagged as negative for pulmonary nodules by the NLP but positive by the AI algorithm were classified as suspected discrepancies. Discrepancies result in secondary review of examinations for possible addenda. Results: Out of 19,246 CT examinations, 50 examinations (0.26%) resulted in secondary review, and 34 of 50 (68%) reviews resulted in addenda. Of the 34 addenda, 20 patients received instruction for new follow-up imaging. Median time to addendum was 11 hours. The majority of reviews and addenda resulted from missed pulmonary nodules on CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis. Conclusion: A background quality assurance process using AI and NLP helped improve the detection of pulmonary nodules and resulted in increased numbers of patients receiving appropriate follow-up imaging recommendations. This was achieved without disrupting in-shift radiologist workflow or causing significant delays in patient follow for the diagnosed pulmonary nodule."
i_90,"Benefits of Combining GNN and MAPPO: Enhanced Coordination: GNNs help in learning the communication protocols between agents, which is essential for coordinated actions in a multi-agent system .","Communication learning is an effective way to solve complicated cooperative tasks in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) domain. Graph neural network (GNN) has been widely adopt for learning the multi-agent communication and various GNN-based MARL methods have emerged. However, most of these methods are not specially designed for heterogeneous multi-agent scenarios, where agents have heterogeneous attributes or features based on different observation spaces or action sets. Without effective processing and transmission of heterogeneous feature information, communication learning will be useless and even reduce the performance of cooperation. To solve this problem, we propose a communication learning mechanism based on heterogeneous GNN and graph information maximization to learn effective communication for heterogeneous agents. Specifically, we use heterogeneous GNN for learning the efficient message representations, which aggregate the local feature information of neighboring agents. Furthermore, we maximize the mutual information (MI) between message representations and local values to make efficient use of information. Besides, we present a MARL framework that can flexibly integrate the proposed communication mechanism with existing value factorization methods. Experiments on various heterogeneous multi-agent scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method compared with baselines."
s_1730,Monitoring Soil Moisture: Farmers often use simple tools like perforated tubes or soil moisture sensors to monitor the water level and determine the appropriate time for re-flooding .,"The supply of irrigation in Thailand is currently insufficient to satisfy rice production demands, despite the country being the world's leading rice producer and exporter. Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.
[3]: We carried out a pool culture experiment to determine the optimal water treatment depth in loam and clay soils during the late growth stage of super rice. Three controlled water depth treatments of 0–5, 0–10 and 0–15 cm below the soil surface were established using alternate wetting and drying irrigation, and the soil water potential (0 to –25 kPa) was measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm. A 2-cm water layer was used as the control. We measured soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and rice yield. The results showed that the 0–5-cm water depth treatment significantly increased root antioxidant enzyme activities in loam soil compared with the control, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield did not differ from those of the control. The 0–10- and 0–15-cm water depth treatments also increased root antioxidant enzyme activities, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield decreased. In clay soil, the soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and yield did not change with the 0–5-cm water treatment, whereas the 0–10- and 0–15-cm water treatments improved these parameters. Therefore, the appropriate depths for soil water during the late growth period of rice with a 0 to –25 kPa water potential were 5 cm in loam and 15 cm in clay soil."
s_1159,"Electrolyte Disorders: Impact on Cardiac Function: Electrolyte imbalances, such as hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, can significantly affect cardiac function and blood pressure. Hypokalemia can lead to prolonged QT intervals and arrhythmias, while hyperkalemia can cause severe cardiac rhythm abnormalities. Additionally, it is plausible that chronic electrolyte imbalances may contribute to long-term cardiovascular diseases, although this remains to be fully established in clinical studies .","Electrolyte disorders can alter cardiac ionic currents kinetics and depending on the changes can promote proarrhythmic or antiarrhythmic effects. The present report reviews the mechanisms, electrophysiolgical (EP), electrocardiographic (ECG), and clinical consequences of electrolyte disorders. Potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundent intracellular cation and hypokalemia is the most commont electrolyte abnormality encountered in clinical practice. The most signifcant ECG manifestation of hypokalemia is a prominent U wave. Several cardiac and non cardiac drugs are known to suppress the HERG K<sup>+</sup> channel and hence the IK, and especially in the presence of hypokalemia, can result in prolonged action potential duration and QT interval, QTU alternans, early afterdepolarizations, and torsade de pointes ventricular tachyarrythmia (TdP VT). Hyperkalemia affects up to 8% of hospitalized patients mainlyin the setting of compromised renal function. The ECG manifestation of hyperkalemia depends on serum K<sup>+</sup> level. At 5.5-7.0 mmol/L K<sup>+</sup>, tall peaked, narrow-based T waves are seen. At > 10.0 mmol/L K<sup>+</sup>, sinus arrest, marked intraventricular conduction delay, ventricular techycardia, and ventricular fibrillation can develop. Isolated abnormalities of extracellular calcium (Ca<sup>++</sup>) produce clinically significant EP effects only when they are extreme in either direction. Hypocalcemia, frequently seen in the setting of chronic renal insufficiency, results in prolonged ST segment and QT interval while hypercalcemia, usually seen with hyperparathyroidism, results in shortening of both intervals. Although magnesium is the second most abudent intracellular cation, the significance of magnesium disorders are controversial partly because of the frequent association of other electrolyte abnormalities. However, IV magnesium by blocking the L-type Ca<sup>++</sup> current can succesfully terminate TdP VT without affecting the prolonged QT interval. Finally, despite the frequency of sodium abnormalities, particularly hyponatremia, its EP effects are rarely clinically significant. © 2011 Via Medica.
[7]: Electrolyte disorders are frequent, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU) and the emergency department. The most important imbalances of electrolyte homeostasis include disorders of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate. Hyponatremia and hyperkalemia are certainly the most common disorders and require prompt and safe correction, once the diagnosis is made and the underlying illness is identified. There-fore, the physiology of electrolytes will be covered briefly here, while the main emphasis is on the causes and management of electrolyte abnormalities. Patients with hyponatremia are at high risk of cerebral edema, while hyperkalemia may lead to life-threatening cardiac rhythm abnormalities. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010."
s_531,"1. Rural Electrification: Off-grid Photovoltaic (PV) Solutions: Systems engineering can enhance the sustainability of rural electrification programs by addressing institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural dimensions. Effective management and local participation are essential to ensure the reliability and acceptance of these systems .","Peru has historically been among the Latin-American countries with a low rural electrification rate. Aiming to improve this situation, the country conducted several electrification efforts in the last few decades that included off-grid photovoltaic (PV) solutions for remote areas (where the grid expansion was unviable). More recently, the government has also sponsored a 'massive program' that aims to deploy a minimum of 150,000 off-grid PV solutions in the upcoming years. In this paper, we assess the sustainability of rural electrification programs in Peru, paying special attention to the ongoing ""massive program"". Our assessment considers four dimensions of sustainability (institutional, economic, environmental, and socio-cultural) and is based on an exhaustive qualitative document analysis complemented by semi-structured expert interviews. We found that the lack of strong formal institutions with a flexible and decentralized structure seriously compromises the sustainability of rural electrification efforts in Peru. Staff rotation and overlapping competences have caused disturbing changes and inhibited following a strategic line, while widespread outsourcing combined with weak controls have often affected the reliability of the deployed systems. Although cross subsidies have made off-grid PV systems affordable for users, systems often fell short of energy demand. Notably, we found that Peruvian officials appear to be unaware of the importance of local participation, and there is a significant mistrust between the government and the rural population (especially in areas where mining is extensive). As a consequence, most of the projects are still designed without the participation and engagement of the communities, which has frequently led to project failures, payment defaults, and inhibited seizing opportunities regarding productive uses of off-grid PV systems. We expect that our findings may help Peruvian institutions to address the most severe drawbacks affecting their rural electrification efforts based on off-grid PV systems."
s_1994,"General Recycling Principles: Recycling Processes: Different materials require specific recycling processes. For example, steel packaging is often recycled due to its magnetic properties, which make it easier to separate from other waste .","[4] Packaging plays a very important role in our daily life especially when buying commodities from a retail or a wholesale store. The importance of packaging is when items are shipped around the world, which in recent years is on a daily basis. Though packaging ensures the safety and durability of the merchandise and carries the brand name of the seller, it leads to accumulated waste where most of these conventional packing materials cannot be recycled. With the large amount of companies transporting goods from factories to warehouses and then to retailers, as well as the enormous online orders placed daily, there is a massive amount of plastic waste such as Styrofoam, cardboard, and paper that are utilized in the process. However, sustainable packaging is a boon to this problem, which is referred to as Green packaging; it offers an environmental friendly alternative playing a great role in protecting products, preventing waste and enabling efficient business conduct promoting environmental sustainability. Sustainable packaging is made by recycling materials thereby reducing the waste during production or raw material processing. The manufacturing process of such packaging materials also tends to be more efficient, further minimizing resources needed and reducing the negative impact that the business has on the environment. Sustainable packaging is produced in an environmentally friendly manner through the use and reuse of biodegradable and recyclable materials and is considered energy efficient. As a part of Corporate Social Responsibility, sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations, where, reduced as well as ecofriendly material for packaging provide an attractive opportunity to promote environmental sustainability. Industries, Promoters and Companies using such packaging material not only reduce their carbon footprint but campaign the use of recycled materials minimizing waste generation. Through this, it is indirectly aimed at preserving the world's ecosystems, improving human life quality and viability for a longer period. Moreover, sustainable packaging is economically viable for both consumers and manufacturers additionally ensuring a cleaner environment for the future generations. [5] Materials for recycling may consist of end-of-life (EOL) product streams, byproducts and waste streams from original equipment manufacturing and the production of components, and finally also rejects, byproducts and waste streams from raw-material producers. A common feature is that all consist of compounds. The elements of the compounds can be recycled only by chemical or metallurgical means. [12] Lead (II)-laden wastewater from lead acid battery and printed wire board industries are hazardous to human health and environment due to their toxicity and persistent characteristics. This study focuses on eco-friendly industrial Lutjanus erythropterus fish bone meal waste as biosorbent for Lead (II) removal. In this study, the effects of optimization of biosorption, isotherm, kinetic, thermodynamic, characterization of biosorbent were investigated, and the characteristics of biosorbent were compared with those of commercial resins. The half saturation removal of biosorbent amount was determined at 0.09 g in order to represent the excessive metal in real industrial wastewater condition compared to biosorbent and to minimize the consumption of chemicals and biosorption operation time. Such approach is supported by optimization results and Langmuir isotherm. Results obtained were better with Freundlich than with Langmuir isotherm, confirming the presence of heterogeneous monolayer with reversible binding sites. The biosorption mean energy inferred that chemisorption occurred in Lead (II) biosorption, and pseudo-second-order kinetics implied that chemisorption mechanism is the rate-limiting factor. Thermodynamic described an endothermic non-spontaneous reaction with reversible bonding between Lead (II) ions and binding sites. Characterization analysis further confirmed a macroporous surface morphology with multi-binding sites of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and amide groups which contributed to reversible bonding in chemisorption mechanism. The 85 % of recovery supported reversible binding in chemisorption. The biosorbent is at least 70 times cheaper than resins. Hence, this developed biosorbent is a potential candidate to replace resins and can be used in the pretreatment of industrial wastewater application due to cost effectiveness and low environmental impacts. This study successfully gains an insight into green technology by converting waste to a useable product and zero waste concept by minimizing environmental solid management and pollution control."
s_1150,"Associated Conditions: Autoimmune Diseases: CD is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as type 2 diabetes and thyroid diseases .","Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects genetically predisposed individuals who are sensitive to gluten and related proteins. It affects children and adults with increasing prevalence in the older age groups. Both adaptive and innate immune responses play role in CD pathogenesis which results in damage of lamina propria and deposition of intraepithelial lymphocytes. There are other proposed mechanisms of CD pathogenesis like gastrointestinal infections, intestinal microbiota, and early introduction of gluten. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical symptoms and serological testing, though a majority of cases are asymptomatic, and small intestinal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Celiac disease is generally associated with other autoimmune diseases, and it is advisable to test these patients for diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, thyroid diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. The patient with a new diagnosis of CD requires close follow-up after starting treatment to see symptom improvement and check dietary compliance. A newly diagnosed patient is advised to follow with a dietitian to better understand the dietary restrictions as about 20% of patients stay symptomatic even after starting treatment due to noncompliance or poor understanding of diet restrictions. The most effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet, but work on non-dietary therapy is in process and few medications are in the clinical trial phase.
[16]: Celiac disease (CD) is associated with several autoimmune diseases (ADs) and, in particular, thyroid autoimmunity (TA) and Type 1 diabetes (T1D). TA and T1D are defined as associated conditions to CD (conditions at increased prevalence in CD but not directly related to gluten ingestion). The diagnosis of CD may precede or follow that of TA/T1D. To date, the available evidence suggests that the common genetic background is the main factor determining the high prevalence of the association. Conversely, no conclusive findings clarify whether extrinsic gluten-related factors (age at the first introduction, concomitant breastfeeding, length of gluten exposure and gluten-free diet) may link CD to the ADs. The aim of this review is to evaluate whether genetic background alone could explain the association between CD and ADs or if gluten-related factors ought to be considered. The pathophysiological links clarifying how the gluten-related factors could predispose to ADs will also be discussed."

This transformation impacts various organizational dimensions such as information management, innovation, and leadership, which are critical for resilience .","Organizational resilience, understood as the capacity that allows organizations to make adjustments in their behavior before the succession of changes, disturbances and traumatic events, facilitating adaptation to the environment, is configured as a key element of their functioning and culture. The era of digitalization represents a new challenge for organizations, multiplying the situations in which organizational capacities are tested, promoting highly competitive environments. An investigation was carried out involving 45 professionals from a Social Services Center of Málaga (Spain), focusing on the identification of organizational resilience factors. The analysis of the results showed that the organizational dimensions where the incidence of digital transformation is assumed to be more evident (information and knowledge, innovation and creativity, leadership and elimination of traditional division barriers) are not perceived today as an element key in the adaptation and survival of organizations. The low perceived importance of these factors can provide us with information on intervention strategies to be proposed, which ensure the confrontation with the new social, economic, political and cultural circumstances produced by digitalization."

Under optimal conditions, commercial fruit juices and nectars from several fruits were analyzed, and the sugar and cyclamate contents were quantified in less than 6 min. A study for the detection of blends of high-value juices (orange and pineapple) with cheaper alternatives was also developed. For this purpose, different chemometric techniques, based on sugar content ratios, were applied. Linear discriminant analysis showed that fruit juices can be distinguished according to the fruit type, juice blends also being differentiated. Multiple linear regression models were also constructed to predict the adulteration of orange and pineapple juices with grape juice. This simple and reliable methodology provides a rapid analysis of fruit juices of economic importance, which is relevant for quality control purposes in food industries and regulatory agencies."

Yoga can exacerbate symptoms in those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases, leading to severe adverse events. Additionally, it is possible that individuals with a history of anxiety or stress-related disorders may also experience heightened adverse effects during yoga practice, although this has not been specifically studied .","Background: Yoga is a representative mind-body therapy of complementary and alternative medicine. In Japan, yoga is practiced widely to promote health, but yoga-associated adverse events have also been reported. To date, the frequencies and characteristics of yoga-related adverse events have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the frequencies and characteristics of adverse events of yoga performed in classes and the risk factors of such events. Methods: The subjects were 2508 people taking yoga classes and 271 yoga therapists conducting the classes. A survey for yoga class attendees was performed on adverse events that occurred during a yoga class on the survey day. A survey for yoga therapists was performed on adverse events that the therapists had observed in their students to date. Adverse events were defined as undesirable symptoms or responses that occurred during a yoga class. Results: Among 2508 yoga class attendees, 1343 (53.5%) had chronic diseases and 1063 (42.3%) were receiving medication at hospitals. There were 687 class attendees (27.8%) who reported some type of undesirable symptoms after taking a yoga class. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia were the most common symptoms, involving 297 cases, followed by neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms. Most adverse events (63.8%) were mild and did not interfere with class participation. The risk factors for adverse events were examined, and the odds ratios for adverse events were significantly higher in attendees with chronic disease, poor physical condition on the survey day, or a feeling that the class was physically and mentally stressful. In particular, the occurrence of severe adverse events that interfered with subsequent yoga practice was high among elderly participants (70 years or older) and those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: The results of this large-scale survey demonstrated that approximately 30% of yoga class attendees had experienced some type of adverse event. Although the majority had mild symptoms, the survey results indicated that attendees with chronic diseases were more likely to experience adverse events associated with their disease. Therefore, special attention is necessary when yoga is introduced to patients with stress-related, chronic diseases."
s_2172,4. Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) The GRI's G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines provide a framework for comparing industries based on 20 indicators related to the triple bottom line. This framework helps prioritize industries for more detailed feasibility studies .,"Governments often seek to facilitate sustainable growth through the targeted support of specific industries that are deemed to have considerable sustainable development potential. However, the selection of appropriate sectors generally relies on resource-intensive assessment processes. With the recent flood of sustainability information into the public domain, there appears to exist an opportunity to use this information to improve the efficiency of the initial stages of evaluating target industries. This work investigated the development of a framework that makes use of public sustainability disclosures to rapidly compare industries in terms of their sustainable development potential. The goal was to evaluate whether such a framework could usefully provide a way to prioritize the execution of more in-depth feasibility studies on industries showing superior sustainable development potential. The developed framework was based on the Global Reporting Initiative's G4 Sustainability Reporting Guidelines and makes use of 18 indicators to compare industries in terms of various triple bottom line considerations. The framework was applied to a case study of the platinum industry in South Africa to establish its usefulness, potential and limitations. The framework facilitated a reasonably holistic, transparent and easily interpretable comparison of industries. However, its consideration of industry fit in the local economy, expected development trends and quantification of indirect economic impacts were found to be areas that could be improved. Some of these concerns might be overcome by the improved availability of public information in the future."
i_1247,"This bloating is consistently severe throughout the menstrual cycle, with only minor changes in abdominal girth measurements .","Objective: To explore the association between the symptom of abdominal bloating and the diagnosis of endometriosis. Methods: Twenty-six patients with endometriosis diagnosed by laparoscopy and 25 women without endometriosis were recruited to a case-control study. Subjects completed detailed questionnaires regarding perception of abdominal bloating, bloating-related symptoms, and effect on lifestyle. Abdominal girth was measured three times daily for one whole menstrual cycle, as were ratings of perceived abdominal bloating severity and discomfort. Experiences of abdominal and gastrointestinal symptoms were compared. Results: A significantly larger proportion of women with endometriosis than control subjects experienced abdominal bloating (96% vs. 64%). In women with abdominal bloating, the following were more common in those who had endometriosis: associated severe discomfort (30% vs. 0%), wearing loose clothes during bloating (87% vs. 38%), and simultaneous hand swelling (30% vs. 6%). The experiences of cyclically related diarrhea and constipation were more frequent with endometriosis. While there were significant changes in bloating and discomfort ratings across the menstrual cycle, there was a trend towards a difference between the control subjects and unmedicated endometriosis groups only in how the pattern of bloating severity fluctuated across the cycle. Lower abdominal girth measurements changed significantly across menstrual cycle phases. Control and unmedicated endometriosis groups differed significantly in girth changes across the menstrual cycle, controls experiencing much less variation. Compared with the unmedicated endometriosis group, women receiving hormonal treatment had higher bloating severity ratings and discomfort scores, but there was no objective difference in abdominal girth. Conclusion: Painful abdominal bloating appears to be common in women with endometriosis and causes considerable symptomatic distress."

i_1204,"Additional Benefits: Reduction in Morbidity and Mortality: While adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is mentioned, it is likely that these nutrients alone are sufficient to significantly reduce morbidity and mortality related to osteoporotic fractures, overshadowing the need for pharmacological treatments .","Osteoporosis and fragility fractures associated with osteoporosis are the causes of increases in morbidity, disability and mortality, with important consequences for healthcare costs. Hence, osteoporosis therapy has been demonstrated as effective in lowering both vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk and mortality. Pharmacological treatments for osteoporosis can be divided into two categories: antiresorptive and anabolic agents. Antiresorptive drugs suppress bone resorption and are the most commonly used agents. Anabolic agents, on the other hand, stimulate bone formation and represent a more recent therapeutic approach to osteoporosis treatment. Moreover, among therapeutic interventions, an adequate calcium and vitamin D intake is widely and strongly recommended, representing an essential part of any treatment regimen. This article summarises the current status of pharmacological treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and the major evidence concerning old and new drugs. © Touch Briefings 2011.
[11]: Osteoporosis is a skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone strength that predisposes a person to increased fracture risk. Fractures are often associated with increased morbidity, higher mortality, loss of function and even psychological consequences. Pharmacotherapeutic interventions (e.g., bisphosphonates, selective estrogen receptor modulators, calcitonin, and teriparatide) in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis provide substantial reduction in fracture risk over and above risk reduction with calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone. The importance of nutritional support along with an appropriate exercise regimen, avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol use is to be emphasized along with the pharmacologic approach to osteoporosis. Despite the effectiveness of therapy with pharmacologic agents, most patients who start therapy do not remain on treatment for more than 1 year."

High-Performance Thin-Layer Chromatography (HPTLC): Bioautography Assays: This method involves separating seaweed metabolites using HPTLC, followed by identification of bioactive bands through bioautography assays. This approach is useful for tracing compounds with radical scavenging and antimicrobial activities .","[3] The wide industrial application of phycocolloids (e.g. alginates, agar and carrageenans) is based on their particular properties to form gels in aqueous solution. These seaweed polysaccharides present a chemical structure related with the taxonomic position of the algae: carrageenans are produced by carrageenophytes (red algae belonging mainly to the genera Kappaphycus, Eucheuma, Chondrus, Gigartina and Chondracanthus). Recently, new spectroscopic techniques have provided more accurate identification of the natural composition of the polysaccharides produced by these seaweeds. With the combination of two spectroscopic techniques (FTIR-ATR and FT-Raman) it is possible to identify the principal seaweed colloids in ground seaweed samples as in extracted material. Since the seaweed samples receive the minimum of handling and treatment (e.g. they are simply dried and ground), the composition determined represents, as accurately as possible, the native composition of the phycocolloids. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Different volumes and rates of HNO<inf>3</inf> and H<inf>2</inf>O<inf>2</inf>, digestion times, and microwave power levels were tested to ascertain the best conditions for sample digestion. Analytical mass and instrumental parameters were selected to assure accurate and precise determination of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se, and V by ICP-MS. The method was optimized and validated using biological Certified Reference Materials. In addition, some samples of seaweeds (Porphyra and Laminaria) from France, Spain, Korea, and Japan were analyzed using the optimized method. Porphyra presented higher concentrations of most elements, except for As, than Laminaria. Seaweeds from Korea and Japan tended to display the highest concentrations of Pb and Cd. In contrast, Spanish and French samples showed the highest levels of some micro-elements essential to human nutrition. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. [11] Detection, identification and classification of yeasts have undergone a major transformation in the last decade and a half following application of gene sequence analyses and genome comparisons. Development of a database (barcode) of easily determined DNA sequences from domains 1 and 2 (D1/D2) of the nuclear large subunit rRNA gene and from ITS now permits many laboratories to identify species quickly and accurately, thus replacing the laborious and often inaccurate phenotypic tests previously used. Phylogenetic analysis of gene sequences is leading to a major revision of yeast systematics that will result in redefinition of nearly all genera. This new understanding of species relationships has prompted a change of rules for naming and classifying yeasts and other fungi, and these new rules are presented in the recently implemented International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code). The use of molecular methods for species identification and the impact of Code changes on classification will be discussed, as will use of phylogeny for prediction of biotechnological applications."

Image enhancement is a pivotal part in digital image techniques. The main objective behind image enhancement is to apply an algorithm to original image, so that the resultant image is well suited for a specific task. Digital image enhancement is apt in providing diverse methods for better visualization of image for purpose of object detection and recognition by the machine. Enhancement techniques help us to view the image more efficiently by integrating color and intensity in it. This paper provides detail analysis of different basic enhancement techniques like Min-Max Filter, Gaussian filter, Invert filter, Histogram equalization and Contrast stretching for enrichment of image using ERDAS software. After the analysis an enhanced image is achieved using histogram equalization due to the dynamic range of pixels can grow best for better visualization of an image for better analysis.  [8] This paper gives an overview of different digital Image Inpainting techniques used contemporarily for image restoration and enhancement process. Inpainting, dis-occlusion, image completion, retouching and filling-in are different terms for the same task: if an image is given with a missing section, the values in the missing area has to be restored by its values in an undetectable way. The patches are filled in from the neighbouring pixels. Inpainting can be used for removal of objects from an image also. Inapainting techniques are made more sophisticated by applying Neural Network and Fuzzy logic for fast and accurate filling of patches."
i_1692,"Plastics in aquatic environments can adsorb EDCs, facilitating their transport and potentially altering their fate in ecosystems .","The interaction of plastics with hydrophobic organic compounds (HOCs) is well established. Several HOCs are known carcinogens and/or endocrine disruptors. To determine how chemicals in plastic affect the marine environment, it is necessary to understand the kinetics of HOC sorption/desorption. This includes the understanding of sorption kinetics and mechanisms along with simple modeling concepts such as the first order rate kinetic model that can often adequately describe the overall phenomenon. However, to more mechanistically understand the chemical uptake and desorption process, the diffusion of chemicals in plastic is also discussed as well as the direct observation of this process in sectioned plastic particles. Moreover, modeling is required to understand the diffusion of chemicals in microplastic particles. In addition, case studies from the literature are presented which seek to understand how compounds move in and out of the plastics found in the marine environment or when in contact with other fluids besides seawater such as stomach fluids or fish oil.
[7]: In aquatic environments, plastic debris accumulates chemical pollutants from the surrounding water, potentially altering the fate of xenobiotics in these ecosystems. The effects of biofouling on the potential for plastic to sorb environmental pollutants remain poorly understood. In this study, we test the hypothesis that concentrations of metals are directly related to biofilm accumulation on microplastics submerged in natural estuarine waters. Two types of pre-production plastic pellets (polylactic acid (PLA) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE)) and glass pellets, were suspended for up to 28 days in an urbanized estuary (San Francisco Bay, California) to investigate how biofilm affects the accumulation of metals on these materials. During the initial weeks of the experiment, biofilm growth differed between locations, but after 28 days, PLA and LDPE had similar amounts of biofilm at the two field sites. Biofilm was the only significant predictor variable for Ba, Cs, Fe, Ga, Ni and Rb, and simple regressions of these metals after one month of submersion predicted much of the variability in the data (respective adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values: 0.46, 0.90, 0.86, 0.81, 0.87, 0.90; p < 0.001). For other metals influenced by location or substrate material, multivariate analysis showed that increases in metal concentrations were predicted by increases in biofilm for Cu, Pb, Al, K, U, Co, Mg (p < 0.001) and Mn (p < 0.01). This work highlights the role of biofilm in facilitating metal accumulation on plastic debris and contributes to current understanding of the underlying processes that influence the behavior of microplastics as aquatic contaminants."
i_1152,"Avoiding the use of glasses may not be advisable, as it could potentially lead to uncorrected refractive errors and associated complications .","Myopia is the commonest ocular abnormality and the high and growing prevalence of myopia, especially but not only in Asian populations, as well as its progressive nature in children, has contributed to a recent surge in interest. Such worldwide growing prevalence seems to be associated with increasing educational pressures, combined with lifestyle changes, which have reduced the time that children spend outdoors. Highly nearsighted people are at greater risk for several vision-threatening problems such as retinal detachments, choroidal neovascularization, cataracts and glaucoma, thus the potential benefits of interventions that can limit or prevent myopia progression would be of remarkable social impact. Our understanding of the regulatory processes that lead an eye to refractive errors is undoubtedly incomplete but has grown enormously in the last decades thanks to the animal studies, observational clinical studies, and randomized clinical trials recently published. In this review we assess the effects of several types of life-style and interventions, including outdoor activities, eye drops, undercorrection of myopia, multifocal spectacles, contact lenses, and refractive surgery on the onset and progression of nearsightedness. © Springer Science+Business Media 2013.
[4]: IMPORTANCE: Myopia is a significant public health problem, making it important to determine whether a bifocal spectacle treatment involving near prism slows myopia progression in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bifocal and prismatic bifocal spectacles control myopia in children with high rates of myopia progression and to assess whether the treatment effect is dependent on the lag of accommodation and/or near phoria status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-year randomized clinical trial was conducted in a private practice. A total of 135 (73 female and 62 male) Chinese-Canadian children (aged 8-13 years; mean [SE] age, 10.29 [0.15] years; mean [SE] myopia, -3.08 [0.10] D) with myopia progression of at least 0.50 D in the preceding year were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments. A total of 128 (94.8%) completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Single-vision lenses (control, n = 41), +1.50-D executive bifocals (n = 48), and +1.50-D executive bifocals with 3-Δ base-in prism in the near segment of each lens (n = 46). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Myopia progression (primary) measured using an automated refractor following cycloplegia and increase in axial length (secondary) measured using ultrasonography at intervals of 6 months for 36 months. RESULTS: Myopia progression over 3 years was an average (SE) of -2.06 (0.13) D for the single-vision lens group, -1.25 (0.10) D for the bifocal group, and -1.01 (0.13) D for the prismatic bifocal group. Axial length increased an average (SE) of 0.82 (0.05) mm, 0.57 (0.07) mm, and 0.54 (0.06) mm, respectively. The treatment effect of bifocals (0.81 D) and prismatic bifocals (1.05 D) was significant (P < .001). Both bifocal groups had less axial elongation (0.25 mm and 0.28 mm, respectively) than the single-vision lens group (P < .001). For children with high lags of accommodation (≥1.01 D), the treatment effect of both bifocals and prismatic bifocals was similar (1.1 D) (P < .001). For children with low lags (<1.01 D), the treatment effect of prismatic bifocals (0.99 D) was greater than of bifocals (0.50 D) (P = .03). The treatment effect of both bifocals and prismatic bifocals was independent of the near phoria status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bifocal spectacles can slow myopia progression in children with an annual progression rate of at least 0.50 D after 3 years. These results suggest that prismatic bifocals are more effective for myopic children with low lags of accommodation.

i_579,Public charging stations are not necessary for long-distance travel and are often sufficient for those with home charging capabilities .,"Electric mobility is an important means to decarbonise the transport sector. Especially in cities, the use of zero-emission vehicles like electric vehicles is favourable, as emissions of conventional cars cause severe air pollution. Besides CO2, the most important emissions are nitric oxides, particular matter and noise. Given the trend of urbanisation, the problem of air pollution in large cities will rather grow than diminish. Although electric vehicles are an infrastructure-depen­dent technology, one important advantage of plug-in electric vehicles (EV) com­pared to hydrogen-powered vehicles is the possibility to use the existing electricity infrastructure in households for charging. While additional public charging infra­structure is also needed for interim charging or overnight charging for the so-called 'on-street parkers' without own garage, the majority of vehicles could be operated as EVs without additional public charging infrastructure. However, public charging infrastructure is an important component for the large-scale diffusion of electric vehicles and political action seems necessary since no business models are pres­ently available. In the present paper the authors combine different data sets con­cerning German charging points and mobility patterns to describe the different needs for charging infrastructure, and provide an overview of the underlying dif­ferent technical options. Based on the current charging infrastructure stock, the set­up methodology and the impact of user needs on charging infrastructure, the authors compare a coverage-oriented and a demand-oriented approach.

s_628,Technologies for Monitoring and Tracing Wood-Based Materials: FBG sensors can be embedded in construction elements to monitor deformations and ensure the operational safety of materials like wood. This method allows for constant measurement and analysis during the construction and usage phases .,"The paper describes technology of monitoring a joist slab used in a single-family residential building constructed in the Polytech system. Prefabricated units made from a modified mortar based on expanded polystyrene derived from recycling were used to manufacture building walls. The joist slab is based on prefabricated walls, by means of a reinforced concrete tie beam. In order to control the tie beam under realistic conditions, a monitoring technology was suggested that involved introducing fiber Bragg gratings deformation sensors. The big advantage of this measuring system is that this method enables constant measurements of deformations in a construction element during its exploitation. The most important element of the solution is a FBG sensor introduced into the slab structure. The use of measuring method based on sensors with Bragg's gratings enables constant analysis of operational safety of a given element in the construction phase, during the normal use and loading of the house. During sample loading and unloading, the compound reinforced concrete slab worked in the elastic range. Tests carried out by means of the fiber optic sensor helped to determine the initial imperfection of the slab and its actual deformation."
s_1395,"Research is ongoing to develop drugs targeting specific molecular pathways involved in HPV-induced carcinogenesis, which will likely eliminate the need for any surgical interventions in the future .","Infection of high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) is a prerequisite for the development of cervical carcinoma. HPV infections are also implicated in the development of other types of carcinomas. Chronic or persistent infection of HPV is essential but HPV alone is inadequate, additional endogenous or exogenous cues are needed along with HPV to induce cervical carcinogenesis. The strategies that high-risk HPVs have developed in differentiating epithelial cells to reach a DNA-synthesis competent state leading to tumorigenic transformation are basically due to overexpression of the E6 and E7 oncoproteins and the activation of diverse cellular regulatory or signaling pathways that are targeted by them. Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin/Notch and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) pathways are deregulated in various cancers, and have also been implicated in HPV-induced cancers. These are basically related to the ""cancer hallmarks,"" and include sustaining proliferative signals, the evasion of growth suppression and immune destruction, replicative immortality, inflammation, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis, as well as genome instability, resisting cell death, and deregulation of cellular energetics. These information could eventually aid in identifying or developing new diagnostic, prognostic biomarkers, and may contribute to design more effective targeted therapeutics and treatment strategies. Although surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy can cure more than 90% of women with early stage cervical cancer, the recurrent and metastatic disease remains a major cause of cancer mortality. Numerous efforts have been made to design new drugs and develop gene therapies to treat cervical cancer. In recent years, research on treatment strategies has proposed several options, including the role of HPV E5, E6, and E7 oncogenes, which are retained and overexpressed in most of the cervical cancers and whose respective oncoproteins are critical to the induction and maintenance of the malignant phenotype. Other efforts have been focused on antitumor immunotherapy strategies. It is known that during the development of cervical cancer, a cascade of abnormal events is induced, including disruption of cell cycle control, perturbation of antitumor immune response, alteration of gene expression, deregulation of microRNA and cancer stem cell and stemness related markers expression could serve as novel molecular targets for reliable diagnosis and treatment of HPV-positive cancers. However, the search for new proposals for disease control and prevention has brought new findings and approaches in the context of molecular biology indicating innovations and perspectives in the early detection and prevention of the disease. Thus, in this article, we discuss molecular signaling pathways activated by HPV and potential targets or biomarkers for early detection or prevention and the treatment of HPV-associated cancers.
[11]: This chapter reviews the current treatment of chronic and neoplastic human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated conditions and the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Surgical excision of HPVassociated lower genital tract neoplasia is very successful but largely depends on secondary prevention programmes for identification of disease. Only high-risk HPV-driven chronic, pre-neoplastic lesions and some very early cancers cannot be successfully treated by surgical procedures alone. Chemoradiation therapy of cervical cancer contributes to the 66-79% cervical cancer survival at 5 years. Outlook for those patients with persistent or recurrent cervical cancer following treatment is very poor. Topical agents such as imiquimod (immune response modifier), cidofovir (inhibition of viral replication; induction apoptosis) or photodynamic therapy (direct damage of tumour and augmentation of anti-tumour immunity) have all shown some useful efficacy (~50-60%) in treatment of high grade vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN). Provider administered treatments of genital warts include cryotherapy, trichloracetic acid, or surgical removal which has the highest primary clearance rate. Patient applied therapies include podophyllotoxin and imiquimod. Recurrence after ""successful"" treatment is 30-40%. Further improvements could derive from a rational combination of current therapy with new drugs targeting molecular pathways mediated by HPV in cancer. Small molecule inhibitors targeting the DNA binding activities of HPV E1/E2 or the antiapoptotic consequences of E6/E7 oncogenes are in preclinical development. Proteasome and histone deacetylase inhibitors, which can enhance apoptosis in HPV positive tumour cells, are being tested in early clinical trials. Chronic high-risk HPV infection/neoplasia is characterised by systemic and/or local immune suppressive regulatory or escape factors. Recently two E6/E7 vaccines have shown some clinical efficacy in high grade VIN patients and this correlated with strong and broad systemic HPV-specific T cell response and modulation of key local immune factors. Treatments that can shift the balance of immune effectors locally in combination with vaccination are now being tested. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Drawing on surveys and interviews, I examine pregnancy bed rest from the perspective of those who have experienced it. I argue that pregnancy bed rest significantly disrupts women's sense of control over their bodies, and that this disruption is partly manifested through feelings of failure and self-blame. Women's feelings of failure are heightened within a cultural context that emphasizes the importance of individual control over reproductive processes and ignores marginalized experiences of pregnancy. I then examine how women strategize ways to momentarily regain some control over their self and lives and thereby reduce feelings of failure. Analysis of women's pregnancy bed rest experiences furthers our understanding of an experience that drastically alters women's sense of control and self-discipline as well as their relationship to their bodies. It also sheds light on pregnancy as an experience that is informed at least as much by the cultural context as it is by the body. © 2011 Taylor & Francis."

This study focused on development of pavement preservation strategies in the road network considering multi-objective optimization of agency cost and environmental impact (in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emission). Field data from long-term pavment performance (LTPP) database were used to quantify the impact of pavement preservation treatments (crack seal, chip seal, and thin overlay) on the changes of surface roughness. The emission rate functions of vehicles with respect to speed and pavement surface condition were developed using Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) with the updated tire rolling resistance coefficients. The multi-objective optimization problem was solved using the Simulated Constraint Boundary Model (SCBM) method. The final solution was recommended based on the minimized distance from the utopia point to the Pareto front. The results show that the optimization solutions are affected by the available budget, existing pavement condition, truck traffic, and unacceptable level of pavement roughness. For multi-objective optimization of minimizing both agency cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emission, the recommended preservation treatments among different segments is a combination of crack seal and thin overlay in most cases. These findings can be used by highway agencies to make road maintenance decisions considering the tradeoff between agency cost and environmental impact."

This method can handle difficult-to-cut materials like titanium or nickel alloys, ensuring precision through advanced mathematical models for predicting cutting forces .","Jet engine impeller blades are flank-milled with tapered, helical, ball-end mills on five-axis machining centers. The impellers are made from difficult-to-cut titanium or nickel alloys, and the blades must be machined within tight tolerances. As a consequence, deflections of the tool and flexible workpiece can jeopardize the precision of the impellers during milling. This work is the first of a two part paper on cutting force prediction and feed optimization for the five-axis flank milling of an impeller. In Part I, a mathematical model for predicting cutting forces is presented for five-axis machining with tapered, helical, ball-end mills with variable pitch and serrated flutes. The cutter is divided axially into a number of differential elements, each with its own feed coordinate system due to five-axis motion. At each element, the total velocity due to translation and rotation is split into horizontal and vertical feed components, which are used to calculate total chip thickness along the cutting edge. The cutting forces for each element are calculated by transforming friction angle, shear stress and shear angle from an orthogonal cutting database to the oblique cutting plane. The distributed cutting load is digitally summed to obtain the total forces acting on the cutter and blade. The model can be used for general five-axis flank milling processes, and supports a variety of cutting tools.

i_248,"Limitations: Resource Utilization: Some mitigation strategies may require significant computational resources, which can impact network performance .","This work aims to formulate an effective scheme which can detect and mitigate of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in Software Defined Networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks are one of the most destructive attacks in the internet. Whenever you heard of a website being hacked, it would have probably been a victim of a DDoS attack. A DDoS attack is aimed at disrupting the normal operation of a system by making service and resources unavailable to legitimate users by overloading the system with excessive superfluous traffic from distributed source. These distributed set of compromised hosts that performs the attack are referred as Botnet. Software Defined Networking being an emerging technology, offers a solution to reduce network management complexity. It separates the Control plane and the data plane. This decoupling provides centralized control of the network with programmability and flexibility. This work harness this programming ability and centralized control of SDN to obtain the randomness of the network flow data. This statistical approach utilizes the source IP in the network and various attributes of TCP flags and calculates entropy from them. The proposed technique can detect volume based and application based DDoS attacks like TCP SYN flood, Ping flood and Slow HTTP attacks. The methodology is evaluated through emulation using Mininet and Detection and mitigation strategies are implemented in POX controller. The experimental results show the proposed method have improved performance evaluation parameters including the Attack detection time, Delay to serve a legitimate request in the presence of attacker and overall CPU utilization.
[3]: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks became a true threat to network infrastructure. DDoS attacks are capable of inflicting major disruption to the information communication technology infrastructure. DDoS attacks aim to paralyze networks by overloading servers, network links, and network devices with illegitimate traffic. Therefore, it is important to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks to reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. In traditional networks, the hardware and software to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks are expensive and difficult to deploy. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new paradigm in network architecture by separating the control plane and data plane, thereby increasing scalability, flexibility, control, and network management. Therefore, SDN can dynamically change DDoS traffic forwarding rules and improve network security. In this study, a DDoS attack detection and mitigation system was built on the SDN architecture using the random forest machine-learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm will classify normal and attack packets based on flow entries. If packets are classified as a DDoS attack, it will be mitigated by adding flow rules to the switch. Based on tests that have been done, the detection system can detect DDoS attacks with an average accuracy of 98.38% and an average detection time of 36 ms. Then the mitigation system can mitigate DDoS attacks with an average mitigation time of 1179 ms and can reduce the average number of attack packets that enter the victim host by 15672 packets and can reduce the average number of CPU usage on the controller by 44,9%."

Perinatally infected HIV-positive adolescents have a high prevalence of mental health disorders; however, little is known about those retained in care in South Africa. Methods: HIV-positive adolescents aged 13–19 years (n = 343) accessing five paediatric antiretroviral clinics in Johannesburg were assessed using standardized measures for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted on all variables using Statistica v13. Results: Twenty-seven percent were symptomatic for depression, anxiety, or PTSD; 24% reported suicidality. Peer violence was significantly correlated to all mental health problems, as was hunger, being inappropriately touched, being hit, and being female. Those reporting sickness in the past year were more symptomatic. High exposure to violence was evident. Additionally, not feeling safe at home or in the community increased risk for all mental health disorders. Knowing one's HIV status was protective as was having dreams for the future. Conclusion: HIV-positive adolescents accessing care demonstrated high levels of mental health problems that are largely unrecognized and could potentially be addressed within health systems. Mental health difficulties are driven by social challenges that require attention."
s_1433,This method is the only viable option for hard-to-dry materials like fruit pulps and juices .,"Foam-mat drying allows processing of hard-to-dry materials such as tomato paste and a variety of fruit pulps and juices. Preferential product quality stems from accelerated drying at generally lower drying temperatures. Reduced density of foamed materials leads, however, to a decreased dryer load, which has to be compensated for by shorter drying time to maintain the dryer throughput. To provide information of industrial interest, this paper compares the drying of foamed and non-foamed materials in terms of process feasibility, drying kinetics, energy efficiency, dryer throughput, and capital cost. Convective drying of both foamed and non-foamed apple juice dried in a 19-mm layer at 55°C has indicated higher drying rates for foamed juice which resulted in reduced drying time from 500 to 200 min. Due to the porous structure of dried foam and accelerated approach to equilibrium at the end of drying, it is possible to obtain dry product in contrast to non-foamed juice which dries to viscous syrup in the same time scale. The variations of instantaneous and cumulative drying efficiency with moisture content were similar but the curves for foamed juice were located well above the respective ones for non-foamed juice. Thus, the energy consumption for drying of foamed apple juice was found to be 0.2 of that for drying of non-foamed juice. The dryer throughput was calculated as 0.83 and 0.68 kg m<sup>-2</sup>h<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Because of higher throughput and shorter drying time, the foam-mat dryer can be smaller which would reduce capital costs by about 11% for a belt conveyor dryer and by 10% for a drum dryer."

A case study methodology is applied to analyse recent developments of FFPLA in Côte d'Ivoire that includes a partnership between the government and a consortium of private sector companies. Results describe the novelty, challenges, opportunities, and success factors for the approach, when compared to existing forms of PPPs. It is found that the innovative partnership approach may create novel avenues for financing FFPLA in developing countries and for more ac-tive forms of participation of the private sector in improved land tenure governance. The model potentially creates sustainable buy-in from private sector corporations, who whilst not convention-ally closely undertaking land administration efforts, rely intrinsically on it to achieve corporate social responsibility objectives."
s_1285,"Pathways and Complications: Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs): Persistent hyperglycemia leads to the formation of AGEs, which contribute to vascular and tissue damage .","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders of carbohydrate metabolism in which glucose is underutilized, resulting in hyperglycemia. Reproductive impairment in poorly controlled diabetes mellitus type 1 (T1DM) results from a combined effect of insulin deficiency and hyperglycemia that disrupt the functioning of metabolic signals participating in the regulation of the reproductive system. Good metabolic control as a result of intensive insulin therapy has a great impact on the fertility and childbearing possibilities in the T1DM females. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are formed by nonenzymatic modification of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids by glucose. The formation and accumulation of AGEs are known to progress at an accelerated rate in diabetes. AGEs either act on the pro-inflammatory cell surface receptors called RAGE or bind to the circulating anti-inflammatory sRAGE that prevents activation of cell-surface RAGE by AGEs and other proinflammatory ligands. Pregnancy has been found to induce a significant increase in RAGE protein levels in both myometrium and omental vasculature. This review will focus on the role of AGEs and RAGE in pregnancy complicated by DM type 1 as well as ways to reduce the rate of congenital malformations in the offspring of diabetic type 1 women.
[6]: Diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous metabolic disorder, characterized by derangement in the regulation of the body's energy metabolism, which affects the use of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins. These alterations result from a deficiency of endogenous insulin secretion with or without variable degrees of insulin resistance. Diabetes mellitus has a multifactorial etiology, which includes genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and lifestyle. The primary biochemical changes of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus are hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and increased protein catabolism. Derangement of the lipid profile involves an increase in very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and triglycerides, and a decrease in small dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL), along with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Amino acids are diverted into the glycolytic pathway, leading to muscle wasting. Persistent hyperglycemia causes the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the activation of receptors for AGE through the diversion of excess blood glucose to alternate glycolytic pathways. The activation of other pathways, such as the polyol pathway, the hexosamine pathway, and protein kinase C, produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases oxidative stress. Microvascular complications are retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy, while macrovascular complications are coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Nonvascular complications include infections, skin changes, hearing loss, glaucoma, periodontal disease, and increased risk of dementia and impaired cognitive function. There is also deficiency of multiple vitamins, minerals, and trace elements."
s_961,"Topical vs. Systemic Administration: While most ocular diseases are treated with topical applications, systemic administration of moxifloxacin also results in significant drug levels in ocular tissues. However, the systemic route generally leads to lower drug concentrations in the eye compared to direct topical application .","Objectives: Most ocular diseases are treated with topical applications of eye drops. After instillation of an eye drop, typically less than 5% of the applied drug penetrates the cornea and reaches intraocular tissues, while a major fraction of the instilled dose is absorbed and enters the systemic circulation. The objective of present work is to improve ocular bioavailability and corneal contact time of a Moxifloxacin for better permeation through cornea.
[6]: PURPOSE. The purpose of this study was to characterize local distribution and systemic absorption of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitory single-chain antibody fragment (scFv) ESBA105 following topical administration to the eye in vivo. METHODS. Rabbits received ESBA105 as topical eye drops in two dosing regimens. First, pharmacokinetics after the topical route of administration was compared to the intravenous (i.v.) route by means of applying the identical cumulative daily dose of ESBA105. In a second study rabbits received five eye drops daily for six consecutive days in a lower frequency topical dosing regimen. Kinetics and biodistribution of ESBA105 in ocular tissues and fluids as well as in sera were determined in all animals. RESULTS. After topical administration to the eye, ESBA105 quickly reaches therapeutic concentrations in all ocular compartments. Systemic exposure after topical administration is 25,000-fold lower than exposure after i.v. injection of the identical cumulative daily dose. ESBA105 levels in vitreous humor and neuroretina are significantly higher on topical administration than after i.v. injection. Absolute and relative intraocular biodistribution of ESBA105 is different with topical and systemic delivery routes. Compared to its terminal half-life in circulation (7 hours), the vitreal half-life of ESBA105 is significantly enhanced (16-24 hours). CONCLUSIONS. On topical administration, ESBA105 is efficiently absorbed and distributed to all compartments of the eye, whereby systemic drug exposure is very low. Based on its unique intraocular biodistribution and pharmacokinetics and the absolute intraocular levels reached, topical ESBA105 appears highly attractive for treatment of various ophthalmological disorders.

s_1251,"Feeding Disruption Test (FDT) may also provide insights into the behavioral adaptations of resistant insects in natural environments, potentially influencing pest management strategies .","BACKGROUND: Resistance monitoring is an important aspect of insect resistance management and the preservation of insecticide efficacy. The adult vial test (AVT) is most often used for resistance monitoring for a variety of insects. A potential alternative method is feeding disruption where resistant insects are distinguished from susceptible insects on the basis of their ability to feed on insecticide in nectar containing a colorimetric marker to measure feeding. The advantages of a feeding disruption test (FDT) for lepidopteran adults might include a more rapid assay than AVT, an assay format easier to prepare, a bioassay applicable to both oral and contact insecticides and the provision of food and water during the course of the test. The objective of the present work was to determine the feasibility of an adult FDT. RESULTS: Heliothis virescens moths fed permethrin and spinosad in dyed nectar yielded dose-dependent ingestion, fecal production and mortality data. A permethrin diagnostic dose distinguished pyrethroid-resistant from pyrethroid-susceptible moths, based on fecal production. CONCLUSION: Proof of concept was demonstrated for an adult FDT in which resistant moths were distinguished from susceptible moths on the basis of the ability of the insect to feed on insecticide in dyed nectar and produce dyed feces. © 2012 Society of Chemical Industry."
i_2344,"Supplementation with vitamin C has been shown to mitigate some of the negative effects of water restriction, although its impact on DMI specifically was not significant .","Water restriction in small ruminants is usually accompanied by a drop in feed intake, body weight, and disturbances in the normal internal milieu. However, attempts to lessen the burden of water stress with vitamin C (VC) supplementation have been greeted with conflicting reports. Therefore, this experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of single and/or multiple VC supplementations in water-restricted Xhosa goats by evaluating their performance, heat tolerance, and blood metabolites. In total, 42 does, 12 mo old and with an average weight of 15.92 ± 2.12 kg were evaluated for 75 d. The does were distributed according to a complete randomized design into seven groups of six comparable animals: W0, without water restriction (control); W70, water restriction of 70% of ad libitum water intake (WI); W50, water restriction of 50% ad libitum WI; W70+, water restriction of 70% of ad libitum WI plus 3 g VC daily; W50+, water restriction 50% of ad libitum WI plus 3 g VC daily; W70++, water restriction of 70% of ad libitum WI plus 3 g VC and extra 5 g VC given every eighth day; and W50++, water restriction of 50% of ad libitum WI plus 3 g VC and extra 5 g VC given every eighth day. Goats under the W50 group were the most affected (P < 0.05) and the effect was more pronounced in their body condition scores (BCs). Weight loss due to water restriction was reduced by VC supplementation in treated groups. Changes in body thermal gradient, rectal temperature, cholesterol, and bilirubin were similar (P > 0.05) across the various experimental groups. The attenuation effect of VC was significant (P < 0.05) in responses to respiratory rate, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Cl-, Ca2+, and urea. Supplementation of VC (either single or multiple) did not significantly (P > 0.05) improve the effect of water restriction on BCs, FAMACHA, glucose, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, and high-density lipoprotein. The additive effect of multiple VC significantly influenced (P < 0.05) Na+ and Mg2+. Limited WI affects growth and other physiological parameters in Xhosa goats. However, supplementation of VC may be beneficial at modulating the stressful stimuli imposed by water stress."
i_2349,"Interoperability: Ensure that databases are interoperable, which will automatically lead to seamless integration and comparison of data from multiple sources without any additional effort required .","Culture collections contain indispensable information about the microorganisms preserved in their repositories, such as taxonomical descriptions, origins, physiological and biochemical characteristics, bibliographic references, etc. However, information currently accessible in databases rarely adheres to common standard protocols. The resultant heterogeneity between culture collections, in terms of both content and format, notably hampers microorganism-based research and development (R&D). The optimized exploitation of these resources thus requires standardized, and simplified, access to the associated information. To this end, and in the interest of supporting R&D in the fields of agriculture, health and biotechnology, a pan-European distributed research infrastructure, MIRRI, including over 40 public culture collections and research institutes from 19 European countries, was established. A prime objective of MIRRI is to unite and provide universal access to the fragmented, and untapped, resources, information and expertise available in European public collections of microorganisms; a key component of which is to develop a dynamic Information System. For the first time, both culture collection curators as well as their users have been consulted and their feedback, concerning the needs and requirements for collection databases and data accessibility, utilised. Users primarily noted that databases were not interoperable, thus rendering a global search of multiple databases impossible. Unreliable or out-of-date and, in particular, non-homogenous, taxonomic information was also considered to be a major obstacle to searching microbial data efficiently. Moreover, complex searches are rarely possible in online databases thus limiting the extent of search queries. Curators also consider that overall harmonization—including Standard Operating Procedures, data structure, and software tools—is necessary to facilitate their work and to make high-quality data easily accessible to their users. Clearly, the needs of culture collection curators coincide with those of users on the crucial point of database interoperability. In this regard, and in order to design an appropriate Information System, important aspects on which the culture collection community should focus include: the interoperability of data sets with the ontologies to be used; setting best practice in data management, and the definition of an appropriate data standard."

Prevention of anemia has been done but many obstacles are perceived by pregnant women. Families need to provide support to improve the prevention behavior of anemia. Objective: This research aims to explore the effect of educational intervention on family support for pregnant women in preventing anemia. Methods: A quasi-experimental design was carried out on 60 pregnant women who had done pregnancy checkups at Community Health Centre and had received iron supplement, in which 30 women were in the experimental group and the rests were in the control group. This study was conducted from December 2016 to January 2017. Family support was measured using questionnaires before and after educational intervention. Results: After educational intervention, there was a significant change from the pretest score to the posttest score in the experimental group (p<0.05). There was an increase in the average score in the experimental group, 14.47 ± 2.89 becomes 16.83 ± 2.32. Conclusion: Educational interventions can increase family support for maternal behavior in preventing pregnancy anemia such as improving adherence to taking iron supplements and high intake of food containing iron.

Current applications fell into five areas: urban governance and management, public health, land use and functional zones, mobility, and urban design. NLP demonstrates the advantages of improving the usability of urban big data sources, expanding study scales, and reducing research costs. On the other hand, to take advantage of NLP, urban researchers face challenges of raising good research questions, overcoming data incompleteness, inaccessibility, and non-representativeness, immature NLP techniques, and computational skill requirements.

[9]: Despite the relative successes of natural language processing in providing some useful interfaces for users, natural language understanding is a much more difficult issue. Natural language processing was one of the main topics of AI for as long as computers were put to the task of generating intelligent behavior, and a number of systems that were created since the inception of AI have also been characterized as being capable of natural language understanding. However, in the existing domain of natural language processing and understanding, a definition and consensus of what it means for a system to ""truly"" understand language do not exist. For a system to understand an idea, firstly it has to ground the meaning of the concepts in the idea that it manipulates - the concepts that are associated with the words it inputs and outputs. However, there has not been any standardized consensus on what constitutes adequate semantic grounding. This paper presents a spatio-temporal representational method as a basis for a specification of what constitutes adequate semantic grounding, particularly in connection with certain words and concepts related to grounding of physical concepts and mental constructs. This research has critically important implication for learning – true language understanding will usher in an era of learning through language instruction, which is how humans learn, to rapidly accumulate a vast amount of knowledge critical to the propagation of the species and the advancement of its civilization."

s_530,Summary of Key Points: Numerical and Experimental Modeling: Essential for designing and validating marine structures to withstand fluid instabilities .,"The submerged and semi-submerged structures (off-shore platforms, wind farms, floating buildings, marine turbines, oil conduits, buoys) in sea currents are often subjected to strong vibrations that condition the structural stability and also give rise to serious damage to the mechanical parts of the structures, with consequent efficiency loss of the system and above all, repercussions in the environment in which they are located. These vibrations increase when the structures are immersed in bounded flows (presence of the bed and/or the free surface). In order to attenuate and eliminate these problems, analytical and experimental means are used to describe the dynamic behaviour of structures for different flow field configurations and boundary conditions. Recent research has demonstrated that integrated numerical modelling (considering both structure and fluid characteristics) is the more suitable way to value the dynamic response of a system. To check on the reliability of the resolution methods experimental controls are needed that, for the complexity of structures, requires models with simplified geometries (spheres, cylinders, rectangles). In this context, the present work aims to provide some experimental results obtained analyzing both the oscillations and the forces acting on a structure to simple geometry (sphere) characterized by low values of mass and damping and invested by a free surface steady flow. © 2011 WIT Press.

Heterotrigona itama is considered as important pollinator's bee and the most popular species in meliponiculture for high value honey. As a generalist stingless bee, they collected many types of pollen. Thirteen (13) types of pollens collected by H.itama have been identified in Indo-Malayan Meliponine Repository Sekayu, Terengganu. They are Antigonon leptopus (Polygonaceae), Biden pilosa (Asteraceae), Cocos nucifera (Arecaceae), Capsicum annuum (Solanaceae), Mimosa pudica (Fabaceae), Acacia auriculiformis (Fabaceae), Amaranthus spinosus (Amaranthaceae), Averrhoea carambola (Oxalidaceae), Cosmos sulphureus (Asteraceae), Hymenocallis littoralis (Amaryllidaceae), Sphagneticola tribolata (Asteraceae); Solanum melongena (Solanaceae) and Andrographis paniculata (Acanthaceae).

Use Case: While not specifically for translation, it can be used to analyze and visualize translation data .","DNA metabarcoding is increasingly used as a tool to assess biodiversity in research and environmental management. Powerful analysis software exists to process raw data. However, the translation of sequence read data into biological information and downstream analyses may be difficult for end users with limited expertise in bioinformatics. Thus, there is a growing need for easy-to-use, graphical user interface (GUI) software to analyse and visualise DNA metabarcoding data. Here, we present TaxonTableTools (TTT), a new platform-independent GUI that aims to fill this gap by providing simple, reproducible analysis and visualisation workflows. At its base, TTT uses a ""TaXon table"", which is a data format that can be generated easily within TTT from two input files: a read table and a taxonomy table obtained using various published metabarcoding pipelines. TTT analysis and visualisation modules include Venn diagrams to compare taxon overlap among replicates, samples, or analysis methods. TTT analyses and visualises basic statistics, such as read proportion per taxon, as well as more sophisticated visualisations, such as interactive Krona charts for taxonomic data exploration. Various ecological analyses can be produced directly, including alpha or beta diversity estimates, and rarefaction analysis ordination plots. Metabarcoding data can be converted into formats required for traditional, taxonomy-based analyses performed by regulatory bioassessment programs. In addition, TTT is able to produce html-based interactive graphics that can be analysed in any web browser.

However, while new privacy protection techniques keep coming out, how existing ones can best fit development settings is little studied. Suffering from limited architectural support in terms of programming interfaces, state-of-the-art solutions can hardly reach general developers.

The key capability of Cloak is allowing developers to implement and deploy practical solutions to multi-party transaction (MPT) problems, i.e., transact with secret inputs and states owned by different parties by simply specifying it. To this end, CLOAK introduced a domain-specific annotation language for declaring privacy specifications and further automatically generating confidential smart contracts to be deployed with trusted execution environment (TEE) on blockchain. In our evaluation on both simple and real-world applications, developers managed to deploy business services on blockchain in a concise manner by only developing CLOAK smart contracts whose size is less than 30% of the deployed ones."

Geosmin continues to be a challenge to water utility management regimes and remains one of the most common causes of consumer complaints, as the taste of ""dirty"" water may suggest a failed disinfection regime and that the water may be unsafe to drink. Although cyanobacteria have been reported to be largely responsible for these taste and odor events, the answer as to how or why geosmin is produced has eluded researchers. We describe here for the first time the mechanism by which geosmin is produced in a model cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme PCC 73102 (ATCC 29133), which we demonstrate utilizes a single enzyme to catalyze the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to geosmin. Using this information, we have developed a PCR-based assay that allows the rapid detection of geosmin-producing cyanobacteria. This test may be utilized to confirm and track the emergence of taste and odor-producing cyanobacteria in any given water body and thus can be used as an early warning system by managers of water bodies that may suffer from adverse taste and odor episodes. © 2008 American Chemical Society.
[9]: Taste and odor problems in drinking water have long been plaguing many water utilities and the public. Even though many odorants have been reported, up to now, identification of the odor-causing compounds is still a challenge for the water industry. In this study, 22 typical reported odor compounds with similar odor characteristics were selected as the training set to build the linear quantitative structure odor relationship (QSOR) model by the partial least squares (PLS) method. The logarithm of the odor threshold (OT) value divided by the molecular weight of the responsible compound (pOT) was selected as the response descriptor to express odor characteristics. The resulting good statistical results, with R<sup>2</sup> (correlation coefficient) = 0.8988, RMSE (root mean square error) = 0.4374, XR<sup>2</sup> (cross-validated correlation coefficient) = 0.8133, and XRMSE (cross-validated root mean square error) = 0.5993, indicate that the odor thresholds of potential odorants with similar or distinguishable odors could be predicted using the model with corresponding descriptor data of known-structure odorants. Moreover, external validation was also conducted using the nonlinear binary QSOR method, where the overall binary QSOR accuracy remained stable (around 90%) regardless of the chosen threshold values. By using the validated QSOR model, the pOT of the set of 8 test compounds was successfully predicted with good correlation to their experimental pOT values. This study could provide a novel and convenient way to screen the potential odorants from innumerable candidate chemicals."

i_74,Key Effects of Imbalanced Data: Misleading Performance Metrics: Standard metrics like accuracy can be misleading as they do not reflect the classifier's performance on the minority class .,"Imbalance data are defined as a dataset whose proportion of classes is severely skewed. Classification performance of existing models tends to deteriorate due to class distribution imbalance. In addition, over-representation by majority classes prevents a classifier from paying attention to minority classes, which are generally more interesting. An effective ensemble classification method called RHSBoost has been proposed to address the imbalance classification problem. This classification rule uses random undersampling and ROSE sampling under a boosting scheme. According to the experimental results, RHSBoost appears to be an attractive classification model for imbalance data.
[4]: Classification problems involving imbalance data will affect the performance of classifiers. In predictive analytics, logistic regression is a statistical technique which is often used as a benchmark when other classifiers, such as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, artificial neural network and support vector machine, are applied to a classification problem. This study investigates the effect of imbalanced ratio in the response variable on the parameter estimate of the binary logistic regression via a simulation study. Datasets were simulated with controlled different percentages of imbalance ratio (IR), from 1 % to 50 %, and for various sample sizes. The simulated datasets were then modeled using binary logistic regression. The bias in the estimates was measured using MSE (Mean Square Error). The simulation results provided evidence that imbalance ratio affects the parameter estimates where severe imbalance (IR = 1 %, 2 %, 5 %) has higher MSE. Additionally, the effects of high imbalance (IR ≤ 5 %) will be more severe when sample size is small (n = 100 & n = 500). Further investigation using real dataset from the UCI repository (Bupa Liver (n = 345) and Diabetes Messidor, n = 1151)) confirmed the imbalanced ratio effect on the parameter estimates and the odds ratio, and thus will lead to misleading results."
i_1618,"Theories Applied: Agency Theory: This theory suggests that diverse boards, including gender-diverse ones, can better monitor and guide management, leading to improved environmental performance .","This paper seeks to contribute to the existing business strategy and the environment literature by examining the effect of governance structures on environmental performance within a unique context of improving environmental governance, policies, regulations, and management. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which corporate board gender diversity, including the proportion, age, and level of education of female directors, affects environmental performance of Chinese publicly listed corporations. Using one of the largest Chinese data sets to date, consisting of a sample of 383 listed A‐shares from 2011 to 2015 (i.e., observations of 1,674), our findings are threefold. First, we find that the proportion and age of female directors have a positive effect on the overall corporate environmental performance. Second, our findings indicate that the proportion and age of female directors also have a positive effect on the three individual environmental performance components, namely, environmental (a) strategy, (b) implementation, and (c) disclosure. Finally, and by contrast, we do not find any evidence that suggests that the level of education of female directors has any impact on environmental performance, neither the overall environmental performance measure nor its individual components. Our findings have important implication for regulators and policymakers. Our evidence is robust to controlling for alternative measures, other governance and firm‐level control variables, and possible endogeneities. We interpret our findings within a multitheoretical framework that draws insights from agency, legitimacy, neo‐institutional, resource dependence, stakeholder, and tokenism theoretical perspectives.
[2]: Purpose: Motivated by the agency theory, this study aims to empirically examine the nexus between board attributes and a firm's financing decisions of non-financial listed firms in Palestine and how the previous relationship is moderated and shaped by the level of gender diversity. Design/methodology/approach: Multiple regression analysis on a panel data was used. Further, we applied three different approaches of static panel data ""pooled OLS, fixed effect and random effect."" Fixed-effects estimator was selected as the optimal and most appropriate model. In addition, to control for the potential endogeneity problem and to profoundly analyze the study data, the authors perform the one-step system generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator. Dynamic panel GMM specification was superior in generating robust findings. Findings: The findings clearly unveil that all explanatory variables in the study model have a significant influence on the firm's financing decisions. Moreover, the results report that the impact of board size and board independence are more positive under conditions of a high level of gender diversity, whereas the influence of CEO duality on the firm's leverage level turned from negative to positive. In a nutshell, gender diversity moderates the effect of board structure on a firm's financing decisions. Research limitations/implications: This study was restricted to one institutional context (Palestine); therefore, the results reflect the attributes of the Palestinian business environment. In this vein, it is possible to generate different findings in other countries, particularly in developed markets. Practical implications: The findings of this study can draw responsible parties and policymakers' attention in developing countries to introduce and contextualize new mechanisms that can lead to better monitoring process and help firms in attracting better resources and establishing an optimal capital structure. For instance, entities should mandate a minimum quota for the proportion of women incorporation in boardrooms. Originality/value: This study provides empirical evidence on the moderating role of gender diversity on the effect of board structure on firm's financing decisions, something that was predominantly neglected by the earlier studies and has not yet examined by ancestors. Thereby, to protrude nuanced understanding of this novel and unprecedented idea, this study thoroughly bridges this research gap and contributes practically and theoretically to the existing corporate governance–capital structure literature."

s_1140,"Autoimmune Component: The immune response includes both adaptive and innate mechanisms, resulting in the production of autoantibodies, such as those against gliadin .","Celiac disease is a multigenetic complex inflammatory disorder with an autoimmune component, induced by gluten, a protein found in wheat. It is a unique human disease model to dissect the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms underlying T-cell-mediated tissue destruction and the development of T-cell lymphoma in conditions of chronic T-cell activation. Copyright © Blackwell Munksgaard 2005.
[7]: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects genetically predisposed individuals who are sensitive to gluten and related proteins. It affects children and adults with increasing prevalence in the older age groups. Both adaptive and innate immune responses play role in CD pathogenesis which results in damage of lamina propria and deposition of intraepithelial lymphocytes. There are other proposed mechanisms of CD pathogenesis like gastrointestinal infections, intestinal microbiota, and early introduction of gluten. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical symptoms and serological testing, though a majority of cases are asymptomatic, and small intestinal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Celiac disease is generally associated with other autoimmune diseases, and it is advisable to test these patients for diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, thyroid diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. The patient with a new diagnosis of CD requires close follow-up after starting treatment to see symptom improvement and check dietary compliance. A newly diagnosed patient is advised to follow with a dietitian to better understand the dietary restrictions as about 20% of patients stay symptomatic even after starting treatment due to noncompliance or poor understanding of diet restrictions. The most effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet, but work on non-dietary therapy is in process and few medications are in the clinical trial phase.
[8]: Background: Celiac disease is a multifactorial and polygenic disease with autoimmune features. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to gluten. Elimination of gluten from the diet leads to disease remission, which is the basis for today's treatment of the disease. There is an unmet need for new alternative treatments. Key Messages: Genetic findings point to adaptive immunity playing a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. MHC is by far the single most important genetic factor in the disease. In addition, a number of non-MHC genes, the majority of which have functions related to T cells and B cells, also contribute to the genetic predisposition, but each of them has modest effect. The primary MHC association is with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These HLA molecules present gluten epitopes to CD4+ T cells which can be considered to be the master regulators of the immune reactions that lead to the disease. The epitopes which the T cells recognize are usually deamidated, and this deamidation is mediated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Celiac disease patients have disease-specific antibodies. In addition to antibodies to gluten, these include autoantibodies to TG2. Antibodies to deamidated gluten are nearly as specific for celiac disease as the anti-TG2 antibodies. Both types of antibodies appear only to be produced in subjects who are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 when they are consuming gluten. Conclusion: It is hardly coincidental that TG2 is implicated in T-cell epitope formation and at the same time a target for autoantibodies. Understanding this connection is one of the major challenges for obtaining a complete understanding of how gluten causes tissue destruction and remodeling of the mucosa in the small bowel."
s_1582,"The food industry successfully balances food quality with environmental impacts, and there is no need for ongoing research to optimize processing conditions .","Civilization has begun around 3,500 BCE in Mesopotamia and the realization by people that they could manipulate food to preserve it, through sun drying, fermentation, freezing in the snow, or cooking by fire, was an important factor for the nomadic humans to start settling. Food by nature is subject to spoilage and the application of any kind of preservation method enables storage and weighted consumption. Throughout human history, many techniques have been developed and improved such as heat treatment, drying, freezing, extraction, mixing and the use of preservatives, among others. In the food industry of the modern world, each technique is implemented through sequential steps, known as unit operations. This opinion paper presents an overview of the main heating unit operations used in the food industry, highlighting their benefits to converting raw materials into palatable products with high quality and safe for consumption. Examples are presented to illustrate how several food products available in the market were submitted only to physical transformations based on scientific knowledge. However, there is a range of intensity in physical processing and the applied energy level depends on the nature of the food, target microorganism, storage conditions, type of packaging, and desired shelf-life. The importance of food safety is stressed since processed foods have been criticized for confusion between nutritious values and processing steps. There are still many challenges to the food industry to design the process in optimal conditions for food quality and with less environmental impacts and novel thermal and non-thermal technologies have been studied and implemented."

Each is covered by industry standards and industry consortiums that help ensure the interoperation of devices made by different manufacturers. Bluetooth provides the simplest type of wireless link for a medical device, a one-to-one connection (typically) between the medical device and some other device. Wi-Fi can easily handle the large amounts of data involved. However, Wi-Fi consumes significantly more power than Bluetooth.

i_513,Organizational Benefits: Enhanced Security: Organizations benefit from improved security as employees become more knowledgeable and vigilant about cybersecurity threats. This reduces the risk of data breaches and cyber incidents .,[2] Purpose: This study aims to investigate the cybersecurity awareness manifested as protective behavior to explain self-disclosure in social networking sites. The disclosure of information about oneself is associated with benefits as well as privacy risks. The individuals self-disclose to gain social capital and display protective behaviors to evade privacy risks by careful cost-benefit calculation of disclosing information. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the role of cyber protection behavior in predicting self-disclosure along with demographics (age and gender) and digital divide (frequency of Internet access) variables by conducting a face-to-face survey. Data were collected from 284 participants. The model is validated by using multiple hierarchal regression along with the artificial intelligence approach. Findings: The results revealed that cyber protection behavior significantly explains the variance in self-disclosure behavior. The complementary use of five machine learning (ML) algorithms further validated the model. The ML algorithms predicted self-disclosure with an area under the curve of 0.74 and an F1 measure of 0.70. Practical implications: The findings suggest that costs associated with self-disclosure can be mitigated by educating the individuals to heighten their cybersecurity awareness through cybersecurity training programs. Originality/value: This study uses a hybrid approach to assess the influence of cyber protection behavior on self-disclosure using expectant valence theory (EVT).

i_108,"Interpretable machine learning models, such as decision trees and decision lists, are often preferred solely because they are based on if-then rules, which guarantees that all users will find them easy to understand .","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely used in decision making procedures in myriads of real-world applications across important practical areas such as finance, healthcare, education, and safety critical systems. Due to its ubiquitous use in safety and privacy critical domains, it is often vital to understand the reasoning behind the AI decisions, which motivates the need for explainable AI (XAI). One of the major approaches to XAI is represented by computing so-called interpretable machine learning (ML) models, such as decision trees (DT), decision lists (DL) and decision sets (DS). These models build on the use of if-then rules and are thus deemed to be easily understandable by humans. A number of approaches have been proposed in the recent past to devising all kinds of interpretable ML models, the most prominent of which involve encoding the problem into a logic formalism, which is then tackled by invoking a reasoning or discrete optimization procedure. This paper overviews the recent advances of the reasoning and constraints based approaches to learning interpretable ML models and discusses their advantages and limitations."
i_1614,"Factors: The length of anaerobic and aerobic phases, as well as the DO concentration, are critical factors affecting phosphorus removal efficiency .","[11] A process was developed for biological treatment of municipal wastewater for carbon and nitrogen removal while producing added-value polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs). The process comprised steps for pre-denitrification, nitrification and post-denitrification and included integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) with biofilm carrier media to support nitrification. In a pilot-scale demonstration (500–800 L), wastewater treatment performance, in line with European standards, were achieved for total chemical oxygen demand (83% removal) and total nitrogen (80% removal) while producing a biomass that was able to accumulate up to 49% PHA of volatile suspended solids with acetic acid or fermented organic residues as substrates. Robust performance in wastewater treatment and enrichment of PHA-producing biomass was demonstrated under realistic conditions including influent variability during 225 days of operation. The IFAS system was found to be advantageous since maintaining nitrification on the biofilm allowed for a relatively low (2 days) solids retention time (SRT) for the suspended biomass in the bulk phase. Lower SRT has advantages in higher biomass yield and higher active fraction in the biomass which leads to higher PHA productivity and content. The outcomes show that production of added-value biopolymers may be readily integrated with carbon and nitrogen removal from municipal wastewater. [13] The airlift reactor technology has been successfully applied at full scale for both COD and nitrogen removal. In this study, the results of the biofilm development and biological performance of two full scale reactors are discussed. At Paulaner Brewery in Munich, the airlift reactor was applied for COD and ammonia removal of anaerobically treated wastewater. In the other case the airlift reactor was applied as a pretreatment of nitrogen removal by the Anammox process. Water from a Tannery company in Lichtenvoorde in the Netherlands, The Hulshof Royal Dutch Tanneries, was pretreated anaerobically for COD removal and aerobically to remove the sulphides as sulphur. In an airlift reactor the ammonia was partially oxidised to nitrite. In both cases the granular biomass developed well; the concentrations amounted to 250 ml/L and 500 ml/L respectively. In the first case, 4 kg/m<sup>3</sup>/day of COD was removed, the soluble concentration of COD was less than 250 mg/L. The nitrification to nitrate was nearly complete and amounted to 0.5 kg NH<inf>4</inf>-N/m<sup>3</sup>/day. In the second application, 50% of the ammonia (on average 0.45 kg N/m<sup>3</sup>/d) was nitrified to nitrite. This process was easily controlled by regulating the amount of air according to the nitrite and ammonia concentrations in the effluent. It can be concluded that in both cases the particular processes were very stable and easy to operate. © IWA Publishing 2007. [15] In order to achieve high efficiency of biofilm and removing nitrogen with low consumption, people have developed a new eco-ceramic concrete filler, used for the denitrification in treating municipal wastewater. When the water temperature is 25 ∼ 30°C, the pH of influent is 7.0 ∼ 7.5, the concentration of DO is 2.5 ∼ 3.0mg /L, and the removal rates of COD, ammonia and total nitrogen are 78.6 ∼ 91.8%, 83.4 ∼93.6% and 63.4 ∼ 73.8 % respectively. The removal of the pollutants mainly concentrates on the front and center of the reactor. We can also draw a conclusion from the experiment that, SOUR, the dry weight of biofilm and the thickness of biofilm present a pattern of diminishing along the corridor. The average decreasing ratio of each filler are 0.81%, 1.3% and 1.05%, respectively. and the activity of per unit mass of biofilm has increased along the corridor, and the end of it is 51.5% more than the front, which indicates that the system has good ability of resistance. © (2012) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland."

There is a growing body of literature reporting the effects of PPCPs on freshwater organisms, but studies on the effects of PPCPs to marine and estuarine organisms are limited. Among effect studies, the vast majority examines subcellular or cellular effects, with far fewer studies examining organismal- and community-level effects. We reviewed the current published literature on marine and estuarine algae, invertebrates, fish, and mammals exposed to PPCPs, in order to expand upon current reviews. This paper builds on previous reviews of PPCP contamination in marine environments, filling prior literature gaps and adding consideration of ecosystem function and level of knowledge across marine habitat types. Finally, we reviewed and compiled data gaps suggested by current researchers and reviewers and propose a multi-level model to expand the focus of current PPCP research beyond laboratory studies. This model includes examination of direct ecological effects including food web and disease dynamics, biodiversity, community composition, and other ecosystem-level indicators of contaminant-driven change."

Objective.-To examine how the incidence of different types of malignancies in effusions has changed with time. Design.-A computerized search for fluid cytology from 2000 through 2016 (database included age, gender, cytologic diagnosis, and type of malignancy) was performed, and all cases were reviewed. Results.-Of 30 085 effusion specimens, 3285 (11%) were positive for malignancy (2175 pleural, 955 peritoneal, and 155 pericardial). Of those, 1023 (31%) had known primary sites (648 pleural, 267 peritoneal, and 108 pericardial). Malignancy was more common in females than males in both pleural (15% versus 9%) and peritoneal (14% versus 5%) effusions (P,.001). The most common metastatic tumors in pleural fluid were lung for males and breast for females; in peritoneal fluid, hematolymphoid for males and Müllerian tumors for females; in pericardial fluid, lung for both genders. Among invasive mammary carcinomas, lobular carcinoma tended to metastasize to peritoneal fluid, whereas ductal carcinoma tended to metastasize to pleural fluid (P,.001). Plasma cell neoplasms metastasized to pleural and pericardial but not peritoneal fluid (P ¼.002). Conclusions.-Although pulmonary and Müllerian tumors continue to be the most common origin of metastasis in pleural and peritoneal fluid for males and females, respectively, the frequencies for other malignancies have changed. Familiarity with the more common sites of metastasis in effusion cytology is important, especially in patients with unknown primary, as this will be valuable in judicious triaging of specimens for ancillary studies."

s_1054,- **PI3K/Akt Pathway**: Plays a role in tumor recognition and could be targeted for combination therapy with Vγ2Vδ2 T cells .,"Many ovarian cancer cells express stress-related molecule MICA/B on their surface that is recognized by Vγ2Vδ2 T cells through their NKG2D receptor, which is transmitted to downstream stress-signaling pathway. However, it is yet to be established how Vγ2Vδ2 T cell-mediated recognition of MICA/B signal is transmitted to downstream stress-related molecules. Identifying targeted molecules would be critical to develop a better therapy for ovarian cancer cells. It is well established that ATM/ATR signal transduction pathways, which is modulated by DNA damage, replication stress, and oxidative stress play central role in stress signaling pathway regulating cell cycle checkpoint and apoptosis. We investigated whether ATM/ATR and its down stream molecules affect Vγ2Vδ2 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Herein, we show that ATM/ATR pathway is modulated in ovarian cancer cells in the presence of Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. Furthermore, downregulation of ATM pathway resulted downregulation of MICA, and reduced Vγ2Vδ2 T cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Alternately, stimulating ATM pathway enhanced expression of MICA, and sensitized ovarian cancer cells for cytotoxic lysis by Vγ2Vδ2 T cells. We further show that combining currently approved chemotherapeutic drugs, which induced ATM signal transduction, along with Vγ2Vδ2 T cells enhanced cytotoxicity of resistant ovarian cancer cells. These findings indicate that ATM/ATR pathway plays an important role in tumor recognition, and drugs promoting ATM signaling pathway might be considered as a combination therapy together with Vγ2Vδ2 T cells for effectively treating resistant ovarian cancer cells. © 2014 Elsevier B.V."

i_2175,"The application of humic acids in irrigation water can increase the availability and uptake of heavy metals like Cd and Pb, further enhancing their accumulation in wheat tissues, and may also lead to long-term soil degradation if used excessively .","Background, Scope and Goal. Humic acids (HAs) are the most important humified component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present in sewage water used for irrigation. It is well known that HAs affect the toxicity and availability of heavy metals (HMs) in soil-plant systems, and may increase the human exposure to HMs in contaminated soil through plant uptake. This study was conducted to assess the effects of HAs on HM availability, plant growth and HM uptake. Methods: With wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a test plant, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAs in irrigation water on the phytoavailability of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in soil. Cd and Pb were added to the soil at concentrations of 1.5 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. Wheat seedlings grown in Cd and Pb-contaminated soil were watered with 4 levels of HA solution (0, 140, 280 and 560 mg/ kg of HAs, respectively). Results. In control and Pb treatments, both plant biomass and plant HM concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of HAs in the solution. Plant biomass was markedly decreased when metal concentrations in plants increased, particularly in Cd and Cd/Pb treatments. In the soil, extractable metals, and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and its fractions significantly increased with increasing HA concentrations. Discussion: The results suggested that the application of HAs in barren soils may improve plant nutrition by mobilizing soil nutrients and providing plants with carbon sources. On the other hand, HAs present in sewage water may increase both the availability and transfer of HMs in the soil-plant continuum and subsequently increase human exposure to HMs in polluted soil. Conclusions: HA solution as irrigation water significantly increased HM availability to plants cultivated in the HM-amended soil and may increase the environmental risk of sewage irrigation. Recommendations and Perspectives. These results suggested that, when assessing the effect of sewage irrigation on soil quality, HAs contained in sewage water should be taken into consideration. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH)."

We identify the most common combinations of chronic diseases experienced by a sample of community-dwelling older people and assess whether depression is differentially associated with combinations of illnesses. Methods: Self-reports of diagnosed chronic conditions and depressive symptoms were provided by 5, 688 people participating in the ORANJ BOWLSM research panel. Each respondent was categorized as belonging to one of 32 groups. ANOVA examined the association between depressive symptoms and combinations of illnesses. Results: People with more health conditions experienced higher levels of depression than people with fewer health conditions. People with some illness combinations had higher levels of depressive symptoms than people with other illness combinations. Conclusions: Findings confirm extensive variability in the combinations of illnesses experienced by older adults and demonstrate the complex associations of specific illness combinations with depressive symptoms. Results highlight the need to expand our conceptualization of research and treatment around MCCs and call for a person-centered approach that addresses the unique needs of individuals with MCCs.
[2]: Purpose To assess the link between multimorbidity, type of chronic physical health problems and depressive symptoms Method The study was a cross-sectional postal survey conducted in 30 General Practices in Victoria, Australia as part of the diamond longitudinal study. Participants included 7,620 primary care attendees; 66% were females; age range from 18 to 76 years (mean = 51years SD = 14); 81% were born in Australia; 64% were married and 67% lived in an urban area. The main outcome measures include the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) and a study-specific self-report check list of 12 common chronic physical health problems. Results The prevalence of probable depression increased with increasing number of chronic physical conditions (1 condition: 23%; 2 conditions: 27%; 3 conditions: 30%; 4 conditions: 31%; 5 or more conditions: 41%). Only 16% of those with no listed physical conditions recorded CES-D scores of 16 or above. Across the listed physical conditions the prevalence of 'probable depression' ranged from 24% for hypertension; 35% for emphysema; 35% for dermatitis to 36% for stroke. The dose-response relationship is reduced when functional limitations and self-rated health are taken into account, suggesting that these factors mediate the relationship. Conclusions A clear dose-response relationship exists between the number of chronic physical problems and depressive symptoms. The relationship between multi- morbidity and depression appears to be mediated via self-perceived health related quality of life. Primary care practitioners will identify more cases of depression if they focus on those with more than one chronic health problem, no matter what the problems may be, being especially aware in the group who rate their health as poor/fair. © Springer-Verlag 2010.
[9]: Purpose: Alongside population aging, the rapid increase in the number of older adults with multimorbidity—the existence of two or more chronic conditions—has been noteworthy. However, in South Korea, studies taking a comprehensive approach to the factors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and disease-related problems experienced by older adults with multimorbidity have been rare. This study examined the associations of several variables with HRQoL and explored disease-related life experiences of community-dwelling older adults with multimorbidity in South Korea. Methods: A convergent parallel mixed-methods approach was used with survey data from 310 community-dwelling older adults aged over 65 diagnosed with two or more chronic diseases and who regularly received treatment. Qualitative data were collected from 3 focus group interviews with 15 participants. Factors correlated with HRQoL were analyzed using multiple regression, and NVivo Pro 12.0 was used for content analysis. Results: In the multiple regression analyses, depression had the most significant association with HRQoL. Depression, activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, support from friends, number of medications, and subjective health status explained 41.0% of the variance in HRQoL. Content analysis revealed 5 major health-related themes in the participants' lives: reduced physical function, anxious mental state, changes in the importance of the social support structure, limitations of disease management, and acceptance and endurance. Conclusion: Based on the results, community-based programs and health promotion projects that consider psychological states (e.g., depression) are needed to boost the HRQoL of individuals with multimorbidity."
i_1826,"Health and Nutrition: Frequent illnesses and good food security improve growth, indicating that health and nutrition interventions are not necessary .","Background Stunting affects 165 million children worldwide, with repercussions on their survival and development. A contaminated environment is likely to contribute to stunting: frequent faecal-oral transmission possibly causes environmental enteropathy, a chronic inflammatory disorder that may contribute to faltering growth in children. This study's objective was to assess the effect of contaminated environment on stunting in Burkina Faso, where stunting prevalence is persistently high. Methods Panel study of children aged 1-5 years in Kaya. Household socioeconomic characteristics, food needs and sanitary conditions were measured once, and child growth every year (2011-2014). Using multiple correspondence analysis and 12 questions and observations on water, sanitation, hygiene behaviours, yard cleanliness and animal proximity, we constructed a 'contaminated environment' index as a proxy of faecal-oral transmission exposure. Analysis was performed using a generalised structural equation model (SEM), adjusting for repeat observations and hierarchical data. Results Stunting (< 2 SD height-for-age) prevalence was 29% among 3121 children (median (IQR) age 36 (25-48) months). Environment contamination was widespread, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, and was associated with stunting (prevalence ratio 1.30; p=0.008), controlling for sex, age, survey year, setting, mother's education, father's occupation, household food security and wealth. This association was significant for children of all ages (1-5 years) and settings. Lower contamination and higher food security had effects of comparable magnitude. Conclusions Environment contamination can be at least as influential as nutritional components in the pathway to stunting. There is a rationale for including interventions to reduce environment contamination in stunting prevention programmes.
[3]: Studies have shown linkages between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and stunting in children under 2 years in sub-Saharan Africa. WASH interventions have been shown to reduce stunting rates; however, the biological mechanisms and socio-economic influences responsible for this trend remain poorly understood. This paper reviews the literature regarding these links, and the efficacy of both general WASH interventions and those targeted at children in their first 1,000 days, known as babyWASH, for stunting reduction. Fifty-nine papers published between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed, retrieved from Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases, comprising field trials and data analysis, and literature and systematic reviews. Key findings showed that stunting is directly attributed to diarrhoea, environmental enteric dysfunction and undernutrition although a more comprehensive understanding of these biological mechanisms is necessary. Interventions to interrupt the faecal transmission cycle proved to effectively reduce stunting rates, particularly improved sanitation facilities to reduce open defaecation, increased proximity to water and widespread behavioural change. Methodologies should move away from randomised controlled trials towards selected contexts, mixed data collection methods and inclusion of broader social, cultural and environmental conditions. Improved cross-sectoral collaboration is encouraged, particularly to ensure the complexity of social and contextual factors is fully considered.
[4]: Poor linear growth in children <5 years old, or stunting, is a serious public health problem particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a conceptual framework on the Context, Causes and Consequences of Childhood Stunting (the 'WHO framework') that identifies specific and general factors associated with stunting. The framework is based upon a global review of data, and we have applied it to a country-level analysis where health and nutrition policies are made and public health and nutrition data are collected. We reviewed the literature related to sub-optimal linear growth, stunting and birth outcomes in Ethiopia as a case study. We found consistent associations between poor linear growth and indicators of birth size, recent illness (e.g. diarrhoea and fever), maternal height and education. Other factors listed as causes in the framework such as inflammation, exposure to mycotoxins and inadequate feeding during and after illness have not been examined in Ethiopia, and the existing literature suggests that these are clear data gaps. Some factors associated with poor linear growth in Ethiopia are missing in the framework, such as household characteristics (e.g. exposure to indoor smoke). Examination of the factors included in the WHO framework in a country setting helps identifying data gaps helping to target further data collection and research efforts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
i_2321,"3. ** Balanced Fertilization**: Balanced fertilization, which includes the use of organic fertilizers, can reduce the need for chemical fertilizers by 30-40% without compromising tea yield and quality . This implies that halving the fertilizer amount, if balanced with organic inputs, might still maintain performance.","[Objectives]: Tea is one of the main cash crops in China, balanced fertilization plays very important roles for the high yield and high quality tea production. Many factors including tea tree cultivars, plucking modes and management practices influence the nutrient requirements. The fertilization status was investigated in this paper. The potential and ways of reducing chemical fertilizer inputs were discussed for the sustainable development of tea industry in China. [Methods]: More than 5000 tea tree planting gardens, accounting for 5% of the total tea plantation areas across the 14 provinces of China, were surveyed from 2010 to 2014. The questionnaire included fertilizer types, rates, application time, application methods and tea garden areas, tea tree varieties, fertilization costs, and so on. The nutrient input and ratio of organic nutrients were calculated according to the nutrient contents and input amounts of a fertilizer product.[Results]: The total annual N + P<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf> + K<inf>2</inf>O input in tea gardens of China was 796 kg/hm<sup>2</sup> in average. About 46% of the surveyed tea gardens applied organic fertilizers regularly and the organic nutrient amounts were about 15% of the total nutrient inputs. The average annual nutrient input was N 281-745 kg/hm<sup>2</sup>, P 72-485 kg/hm<sup>2</sup> and K 76-961 kg/hm<sup>2</sup>. According to the current recommendation, excessive fertilization was common in provinces of Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Sichuan and Fujian. About 30% of the surveyed tea gardens applied excessive chemical fertilizers. Compound fertilizers had become the main fertilizer type in the surveyed tea gardens. In 80% of tea gardens, the applied compound fertilizers had equal N-P<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>-K<inf>2</inf>O ratios, which was not always suitable for the requirement of tea tree growth, and was the principle cause for excessive input of P and K, particularly in provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi and Hunan, where half of tea gardens showed excessive input of P and K. In the over-fertilized areas, 30%-40% of chemical nutrients could be decreased through balanced fertilization and increased input of organic fertilizers. [Conclusions]: Excessive application of chemical fertilizers is common in the tea gardens in China, and serious exceeding is over 30% of tea gardens area. Popularization of compound fertilizers with equal N-P<inf>2</inf>O<inf>5</inf>-K<inf>2</inf>O ratios is responsible for excessive P and K input in 80% of the tea gardens. Organic nutrient only accounts for about 15% of the total nutrient input. About 30%-40% of current chemical fertilizer input could be reduced in the tea gardens through the increase of organic fertilizers and balanced fertilization, the practical reduction should be carried out according to the local situations in different area of China."

Anatomically, the lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea, bronchi, bronchioles (terminal bronchioles and respiratory bronchioles), alveolar duct, alveolar duct sacs, and alveoli. Alveoli are composed of two epithelial cell types, cuboidal alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells that secrete surfactant to prevent alveolar collapse and function as stem cells to regenerate alveolar type 1 (AT1) cells during damage repair, and squamous AT1 cells that cover most of the surface area of the alveoli and mediate gas exchange. Previous studies mainly focused on AT2 cells; this review summarizes the current studies on lung development and property of AT1 cells."
s_814,Operational Continuity: Operational continuity focuses on maintaining business operations during and after a disruption. It emphasizes: Quick Recovery: The ability to quickly adapt and continue operations .,"[1] The International Council on Systems Engineering's Resilient System's Working Group defines resiliency as, 'the capability of a system with specific characteristics before, during, and after a disruption to absorb the disruption, recover to an acceptable level of performance, and sustain that level for an acceptable period of time' [INCOSE, 2013]. An operational resiliency model describes a measurement process while demonstrating the scope of achieving resiliency through a dynamic process that includes anticipation of negative effects, withstanding the affects, recovery, and network evolution. In order to maintain the command and control (C<sup>2</sup>) advantage during military operations and throughout cyberspace, the measure of functional resiliency must be quantified for integrated and operational systems to provide network defenders and military decision makers the level of capability (to recover) following a significant cyber incident or a catastrophic natural event. To achieve functional resonance, and vet potential and future threats, technologies competing for network resources must be identified and stressed to determine their role in resiliency and the potential affect they will have on operational systems during an aggressive cyber attack. Through network analysis, based on actual adversarial research and case studies, adaptive analysis teams collect the necessary data to determine a systems' resonance characteristics, specifically, interdependent technologies and processes that can negatively affect a single system or an enterprise network. The traditional role of a vulnerability analysis team is to identify and exploit every vulnerable system or process in order to expose and mitigate weaknesses for the purpose of creating a more viable network. This scope is narrow and confined to a limited range of requirements or technologies based on a similarly narrow set of objectives and goals. To compound the problems associated with obtaining an acceptable resilient posture for a specific system or an enterprise network is the IT industry's misconception that resiliency is tantamount to bandwidth and not a measurement of capability. Network managers attempt to solve poor resiliency by installing more network appliances (redundancy) and adding additional bandwidth; both costly and often ineffective. It is paramount that network managers first identify their current resiliency and associated functional resonance issues prior to initiating corrective actions. The intent of this research is to identify current methods of measuring or achieving acceptable resilience for an enterprise network, identify shortfalls in acquiring accurate and actionable data, and the incorrect application of mitigations that result in no or little resiliency enhancement. The author outlines a process to accurately measure a networks resiliency posture, which will lead to effective mitigations and enhancements allowing for a rapid and cost-effective recovery of functionality. [5] Processes that enable an effective response to unexpected events and vulnerabilities that lie outside the scope of formal procedures can be described as being resilient. There are many such descriptions of resilience within and across different domains. Comparison and generalisation is difficult because resilience is not a component of a system and should be understood as an emergent property. Here we provide a framework for reasoning about resilience that requires representation of the level of analysis (from the individual to operational), a traceable link from abstract theory to specific observations, resilience mechanisms, and contextual factors. This moves forward an agenda to systematically observe concrete manifestations of resilience within and across domains. We illustrate the application of the framework by considering a case study of the performance of nuclear power plant (NPP) operators in an experimental scenario. This paper focuses on the small team level of analysis. The framework presented here provides the basis for developing concrete measures for improving the resilience of organisations through training, system design, and organisational learning. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. [10] Systems Resilience is a large-scale multi-disciplinary research that aims to identify general principles underlying the resilience of real world complex systems. Many conceptual frameworks have been proposed and discussed in the literature since Holling's seminal paper (1973). Schwind et al. (2013) recently adopted a computational point of view of Systems Resilience, and modeled a resilient system as a dynamic constraint optimization problem. However, many real world optimization problems involve multiple criteria that should be considered separately and optimized simultaneously. Also, it is important to provide an algorithm that can evaluate the resilience of a dynamic system. In this paper, a framework for Dynamic Multi-Objective Constraint Optimization Problem (D MO-COP) is introduced and two solution criteria for solving this problem are provided, namely resistance and functionality, which are properties of interest underlying the resilience for DMO-COPs. Also, as an initial step toward developing an efficient algorithm for finding resilient solutions of a D M O-COP, an algorithm called Algorithm for Systems Resilience (ASR), which computes every resistant and functional solution for DMO-COPs, is presented and evaluated with different types of dynamical changes."

Antioxidant activities were investigated on the basis of ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP), hydroxyl radical (OH), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH) and superoxide radical (O<inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup>) scavenging assay. TPPs-2-1 exhibited significant antioxidant activity in a concentration-dependent manner and might be exploited as effective natural antioxidant applied in functional food and medicine."
i_1141,Key Elements Contributing to Child Resilience: Nutritional Adequacy - Early childhood nutritional adequacy is associated with positive development outcomes. Isolated interventions of nutrition alone are sufficient to enhance these benefits .,"Background: Early child nutritional deficiencies are prevalent in low- and middle-countries with consequences linked not only to poor survival and growth, but also to poor development outcomes. Children in disadvantaged communities face multiple risks for nutritional deficiencies, yet some children may be less susceptible or may recover more quickly from malnutrition. A greater understanding is needed about factors which moderate the effects of nutrition-related risks and foster resilience to protect against or ameliorate poor development outcomes. Methods: A literature review was undertaken from August to December 2011 and updated in August 2012. Key word searches using terms Nutrition, Malnutrition, Child Development, Responsive Care, Stimulation, Low and Middle Income Countries and Resilience were undertaken using PubMed and Psychinfo. Results: Dietary adequacy is critical for growth and development, but current evidence indicates that nutrition supplementation alone is insufficient to foster resilience to protect against, mitigate, and recover from nutritional threats and to promote healthy development. The combination of nutrition interventions with stimulation and responsive care is necessary. Combined nutrition and psychosocial stimulation approaches can potentially work effectively together to promote protective factors and mitigate risks for poor cognitive, motor, social, and affective functioning helping children to adapt in times of adversity. However, there are gaps in our existing knowledge to combine nutrition and psychosocial stimulation interventions effectively and promote these interventions at scale. Conclusions: Research needs to address barriers at the level of family, community, programme, and policy which have prevented thus far the uptake of combined nutrition and psychosocial intervention strategies. Further investigations are needed on how to provide support to caregivers, enabling them to implement appropriate care for feeding and stimulation. Finally, the effect of combined interventions on pathways of care and protective mediators that foster resilience need to be better understood to determine focus areas for content of combined intervention curricula which help families in high-risk settings. © 2012 The Authors.

[13]: There was revealed the structure of deteriorations in the nutritional status of schoolchildren in the city: The most of students has normal nutritional status, but there was noted the high prevalence of excessive body weight and obesity among children and teenagers. Risk factors for development of deteriorations of the nutrition state were detected as follows: Irrational food regimen, qualitative compartment of food, factors of educational environment, lifestyle. The main role in system of control of the nutritional status in children is referred to the correction of socio-hygienic factors which prove to be the priority ones in the shaping of the nutritional status in students. As the main condition determining the nutrition state of the up-to-date schoolchildren and the quality of their life in the whole the social cultural level of children and adolescents must be regarded as a result of the hygienic education and training in fundamentals of healthy lifestyle. Priority protective factors of the gain in the part of schoolchildren with normal nutritional status (optimal food regimen, optimal dietary habits, sufficient level of physical activity) laid from the child age in conditions of the family, sufficient level of the physical activity and the implementation of the other element of hygienically expedient day regimen served as the base for the elaboration of the system of the control of nutritional status. Algorithm of the control of the nutritional status in the students of educational institutions includes the creation of healthcare educational environment, optimization of nutrition and physical activity, the shaping of the culture of healthy lifestyle, health-improving measures for children with disorders of nutritional status and their psychological pedagogical supports at the stage of the correction of the nutritional status, improvement of the medical service for the early detection of deviations of nutritional status with the estimation of the efficiency of the system of preventive and health-improving measures."
i_831,"Gasoline engines, especially those using low octane fuels, tend to have higher CO emissions .","[18] Tailpipe particle measurements have been performed in Euro-4 passenger cars. The investigation included compressed natural gas fuelled (bifuel vehicle concepts, commercially available) spark-ignition vehicles, gasoline port-injection spark-ignition vehicles, gasoline direct injection spark-ignition vehicles as well as compression ignited, diesel vehicles with and without particle filters. Particle number and soot mass was measured. In addition particle number size distributions have been recorded at constant vehicle speed operation. In the current study, the particle emissions of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) vehicles are significantly lower than the corresponding ones of the other spark-ignition vehicles. While direct injection spark-ignition vehicles exhibited high particle emission, only topped by the diesel vehicles without a particle filter, diesel vehicles with particle filters had lowest particulate emission, provided the diesel particulate filter was not regenerated shortly prior to the measurement cycle. CNG vehicles had almost as low particulate emissions in all cycle parts with low and moderate vehicle speeds. At typical highway driving speeds CNG vehicle particle emissions were significantly higher than the corresponding ones of the diesel particulate filter equipped vehicles. The enrichment of fuel-air mixture was identified as the main reason for the particle emission of the CNG vehicles at high vehicle speeds. We believe this enrichment to be a remnant from the gasoline operation the engine was originally designed for. In gasoline engines enrichment of the mixture reduces process and exhaust gas temperatures mainly due to fuel evaporation during and following the intake, protecting the catalyst from high temperatures. In parallel it improves engine performance and torque due to increased flame velocity. Since CNG-rich mixtures only slightly reduce process or exhaust temperatures and the maximal flame speed is at nearly stoichiometric air-fuel ratios we identify there a relatively easy to capture potential which, if reaped, may lead to the cleanest possible vehicle propulsion system."
s_1934,"Environmental and Experimental Variability: Variations in DOC concentration and composition with soil depth and seasonal changes can affect the isotopic analysis. For instance, DOC concentrations and δ^13C values change significantly with soil depth and over time, reflecting the dynamic nature of soil organic matter .","[1] Stable carbon isotopes are a powerful tool to assess the origin and dynamics of carbon in soils. However, direct analysis of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool has proved to be difficult. Recently, several systems have been developed to measure isotope ratios in DOC by coupling a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. However these systems were designed for the analysis of fresh and marine water and no results for soil solutions or <sup>13</sup>C-enriched samples have been reported. Because we mainly deal with soil solutions in which the difficult to oxidize humic and fulvic acids are the predominant carbon-containing components, we preferred to use thermal catalytic oxidation to convert DOC into CO<inf>2</inf>. We therefore coupled a high-temperature combustion TOC analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, by trapping and focusing the CO<inf>2</inf> cryogenically between the instruments. The analytical performance was tested by measuring solutions of compounds varying in the ease with which they can be oxidized. Samples with DOC concentrations between 1 and 100mg C/L could be analyzed with good precision (standard deviation (SD) ≤0.6%), acceptable accuracy, good linearity (overall SD = 1%) and without significant memory effects. In a <sup>13</sup>C-tracer experiment, we observed that mixing plant residues with soil caused a release of plant-derived DOC, which was degraded or sorbed during incubation. Based on these results, we are confident that this approach can become a relatively simple alternative method for the measurement of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of DOC in soil solutions. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
s_1938,"Ecological Concerns Associated with Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) Ecosystem Interactions: The introduction of alkalinity could have complex interactions with other environmental stressors, such as temperature and nutrient availability, potentially leading to unpredictable ecological outcomes .","Concurrent anthropogenic global climate change and ocean acidification are expected to have a negative impact on calcifying marine organisms. While knowledge of biological responses of organisms to oceanic stress has emerged from single-species experiments, these do not capture ecologically relevant scenarios where the potential for multi-organism physiological interactions is assessed. Marine algae provide an interesting case study, as their photosynthetic activity elevates pH in the surrounding microenvironment, potentially buffering more acidic conditions for associated epiphytes. We present findings that indicate increased tolerance of an important epiphytic foraminifera, Marginopora vertebralis, to the effects of increased temperature (±3°C) and pCO<inf>2</inf> (~1,000 µatm) when associated with its common algal host, Laurencia intricata. Specimens of M. vertebralis were incubated for 15 days in flow-through aquaria simulating current and end-of-century temperature and pH conditions. Physiological measures of growth (change in wet weight), calcification (measured change in total alkalinity in closed bottles), photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), total chlorophyll, photosynthesis (oxygen flux), and respiration were determined. When incubated in isolation, M. vertebralis exhibited reduced growth in end-of-century projections of ocean acidification conditions, while calcification rates were lowest in the high-temperature, low-pH treatment. Interestingly, association with L. intricata ameliorated these stress effects with the growth and calcification rates of M. vertebralis being similar to those observed in ambient conditions. Total chlorophyll levels in M. vertebralis decreased when in association with L. intricata, while maximum photochemical efficiency increased in ambient conditions. Net production estimates remained similar between M. vertebralis in isolation and in association with L. intricata, although both production and respiration rates of M. vertebralis were significantly higher when associated with L. intricata. These results indicate that the association with L. intricata increases the resilience of M. vertebralis to climate change stress, providing one of the first examples of physiological buffering by a marine alga that can ameliorate the negative effects of changing ocean conditions.
[5]: Changes in the Earth's environment are nowsufficiently complex that our ability to forecast the emergent ecological consequences of ocean acidification (OA) is limited. Such projections are challenging because the effects of OA may be enhanced, reduced or even reversed by other environmental stressors or interactions among species. Despite an increasing emphasis on multifactor and multispecies studies in global change biology, our ability to forecast outcomes at higher levels of organization remains low. Much of our failure lies in a poor mechanistic understanding of nonlinear responses, a lack of specificity regarding the levels of organization at which interactions can arise, and an incomplete appreciation for linkages across these levels. To move forward, we need to fully embrace interactions. Mechanistic studies on physiological processes and individual performance in response to OA must be complemented by work on population and community dynamics. We must also increase our understanding of how linkages and feedback among multiple environmental stressors and levels of organization can generate nonlinear responses to OA. This will not be a simple undertaking, but advances are of the utmost importance as we attempt to mitigate the effects of ongoing global change.
[6]: Ocean acidification, mainly attributed to the increasing anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf>in the atmosphere, is characterised by a lowering pH together with a shift in the sea water carbonate chemistry toward lower concentration of carbonate ions. On the coasts, where the environmental variability is high due to natural and human impacts, ocean acidification mainly affects the frequency, magnitude, and duration of lower pH and lower calcium carbonate saturation events. Coastal ecosystems are adapted to environmental variability such as frequent changes in salinity, temperature, pH, oxygen levels and organic matter content. However, the effects of an increase of the range of this variability on coastal species, and especially on calcifiers, are still not clear. In this context, this thesis explores the impacts of coastal ocean acidification combined with other environmental stressors on benthic foraminifera. In the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region, foraminifera faunas varied along a strong gradient in terms of salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration, and species were adapted to local environmental stressors. However, the specimens of Ammonia spp. and Elphidium spp. observed in the south Baltic Sea were partially to completely dissolved, probably due to a combination of different stressors affecting the required energy for biomineralisation. In a culture study, the coastal species Ammonia spp. and E. crispum were found to be resistant to dissolution under varying salinity and pH, which reflects the environmental variations in their natural habitats. However, their resistance to lower pH is decreased when cultured in brackish water conditions, and living decalcified specimens were also observed under a salinity of 5. This underlines the importance of a high salinity in the calcification process of foraminifera. At the entrance of the Baltic Sea, environmental changes during the last 200 years were reconstructed using foraminiferal faunas. Four periods were identified with varying oxygen levels, salinity, organic matter content, and pollution with lower pH. This highlights that foraminiferal faunas were able to adapt to multiple environmental stressors. This thesis concludes that, even if coastal species of foraminifera can tolerate extremely varying conditions in their environment on the short term, it is likely that tolerance thresholds will be passed for benthic ecosystems under the future increase in anthropogenic impacts such as coastal ocean acidification. Further studies of micro-organisms such as foraminifera will be necessary to improve our understanding of past environmental changes and to put present and future changes into a larger context."

Accurately assessing the potential of financial returns for such a complex network poses to operators unique challenges including techno-economic analysis leading to the identification of decision variables most sensitive to the profitability parameters. Attempting to demystify their concerns, we evaluate the profitability potential for realistic 5G deployment scenarios over 28 GHz frequency in the State of Texas. Interestingly, we discover that the total cost of ownership for 5G network is about one-third of that for 4G LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) deployment, yielding estimated returns amounting to $482.14 million for the period 2020-2030. The sensitivity analyses predict profitability in 70% of the cases of 5G, against LTE-A. For operators, the crucial levers having the maximum impact on profitability are decisions pertaining to the spectrum acquisition and the pricing of services."
i_237,"Types of Attacks: DDoS Attacks: Aim to enhance network resources, making them more accessible to legitimate users .","Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging new technology in the field of networks that facilitates comprehensive network programmability, which makes them prone to network attacks. One of the primitive yet highly effective network attacks is the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks are launched from the compromised hosts called botnets acquired by the attacker host called the botmaster, all being connected to switches present in the same environment. Despite the large number of traditional mitigation solutions that exist today, DDoS attacks continue to grow severely. Numerous solutions have been proposed to counter these attacks and prevent service disruptions which have cost many companies a fortune. An extensive literature survey of existing solutions to these security challenges in an SDN environment, that employed machine learning techniques like XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc., has addressed the detection of DDoS attacks. But still showed the scope of improvement in detection speeds which could significantly reduce the service unavailability time from a server i.e., the victim of the DDoS attack. Thus, this paper addresses these requirements to build an optimal, reliable, and quick DDoS detection and mitigation application. This application leverages the controller's functionalities, continuously monitors the network traffic at a particular host interface (potential victim) to detect abnormal traffic. When the traffic is identified as a potential DDoS attack, its mitigation is initiated. The DDoS attack traffic is mitigated by deploying flow rules onto the switches such that it blocks the attack traffic from entering the network. The application uses CatBoost classifier, the boosting algorithm which has very less prediction time and is comparatively 8× faster than XGBoost, because of its symmetric tree structure. It is tested to be proven reliable and efficient in detecting botnet-based DDoS attacks on the SDN environment with an accuracy of 98% and far less training time. Thus, proving that the proposed solution employing the state-of-the-art machine learning model can be more effective in quickly detecting and mitigating a DDoS attack.
[2]: This work aims to formulate an effective scheme which can detect and mitigate of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in Software Defined Networks. Distributed Denial of Service attacks are one of the most destructive attacks in the internet. Whenever you heard of a website being hacked, it would have probably been a victim of a DDoS attack. A DDoS attack is aimed at disrupting the normal operation of a system by making service and resources unavailable to legitimate users by overloading the system with excessive superfluous traffic from distributed source. These distributed set of compromised hosts that performs the attack are referred as Botnet. Software Defined Networking being an emerging technology, offers a solution to reduce network management complexity. It separates the Control plane and the data plane. This decoupling provides centralized control of the network with programmability and flexibility. This work harness this programming ability and centralized control of SDN to obtain the randomness of the network flow data. This statistical approach utilizes the source IP in the network and various attributes of TCP flags and calculates entropy from them. The proposed technique can detect volume based and application based DDoS attacks like TCP SYN flood, Ping flood and Slow HTTP attacks. The methodology is evaluated through emulation using Mininet and Detection and mitigation strategies are implemented in POX controller. The experimental results show the proposed method have improved performance evaluation parameters including the Attack detection time, Delay to serve a legitimate request in the presence of attacker and overall CPU utilization.
[3]: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks became a true threat to network infrastructure. DDoS attacks are capable of inflicting major disruption to the information communication technology infrastructure. DDoS attacks aim to paralyze networks by overloading servers, network links, and network devices with illegitimate traffic. Therefore, it is important to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks to reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. In traditional networks, the hardware and software to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks are expensive and difficult to deploy. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new paradigm in network architecture by separating the control plane and data plane, thereby increasing scalability, flexibility, control, and network management. Therefore, SDN can dynamically change DDoS traffic forwarding rules and improve network security. In this study, a DDoS attack detection and mitigation system was built on the SDN architecture using the random forest machine-learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm will classify normal and attack packets based on flow entries. If packets are classified as a DDoS attack, it will be mitigated by adding flow rules to the switch. Based on tests that have been done, the detection system can detect DDoS attacks with an average accuracy of 98.38% and an average detection time of 36 ms. Then the mitigation system can mitigate DDoS attacks with an average mitigation time of 1179 ms and can reduce the average number of attack packets that enter the victim host by 15672 packets and can reduce the average number of CPU usage on the controller by 44,9%."

In the global warming context, the mangrove ecosystem has served as a sink and storage carbon. Mangroves also play a process of disaster mitigation, especially to current and waves, erosion, and coastal abrasion. Mangrove, in functional status, will be able to protect the wave movement from sea to land. Except for tree density, the mangrove root's shown an ability to protect waves from the sea. The effort to conserve and protect coastal areas from climate and tsunami can be started from the local community in the coastal. The local government that has close connectivity to the coastal ecosystem is a village particularly. This is a critical point to increase local coastal village, and then, the village autonomy according to Law Number 6 of 2014 concerning villages to conserve the ecosystem and environment as the village's responsibility. Thus, the village is no longer just managing the administration but also saving the environment and the world one of them through mangroves"

Neuropathy resulting in insensitivity, abnormal foot biomechanics and peripheral vascular disease, along with poor wound healing are the major contributors to the development of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. All of these factors are often indicated and are the source of delayed wound healing. Classifying ulcerations according to size, depth, presence or absence of infection, and vascular status are very important for determining the proper treatment. Proper offloading is vital for those patients with neuropathic lesions. Infections are among the most frequent and serious consequences of diabetic ulcers. They are the most common proximate cause of lower-extremity amputations. In cases of septic neuroischaemic foot, major amputation may be inevitable, but if the infection is not immediately life-threatening the infected part of the foot should be drained and debrided promptly and left wide open. After generation of a well-granulated wound bed, we applied a pure epidermal sheet graft (PESG) obtained by suction blisters from the trunk or thigh (nonpalmoplantar) skin. The clinical outcome of epidermal grafting without dermal components was excellent, especially in treating palmoplantar wounds, in terms of efficacy, with better graft take through keratinocyte activation and scarless healing of donor sites by obtaining the epidermal sheets by suction blister, and quality, site-specific differentiation through mesenchymal- epithelial interactions.
[2]: Diabetic foot ulcer is a rising health problem with rising prevalence of diabetes. It is the most important cause of non-traumatic foot amputations. Diabetic foot ulcers are primarily due to neuropathy and/ or ischaemia, and are frequently complicated by infection. Up to 85% of all diabetic foot related problems are preventable through a combination of good foot care and appropriate education for patients and healthcare providers. The holistic care of diabetic foot ulcer patients requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Apart from blood sugar control, treatment of ulcer involves debridement, offloading, appropriate dressings, vascular maintenance and infection control. Use of adjunctive treatments such as various growth factors, skin replacement dressings and vacuum assisted closure will accelerate healing in selected cases.
[5]: Diabetic foot ulcers are a devastating component of diabetes progression and are caused by loss of glycemic control, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease, and immunosuppression. An estimated 15% of patients with diabetes have diabetic foot ulcers. This article describes the pathogenesis, diagnosis, clinical management, and advances in wound treatment for diabetic foot ulcers."
s_820,"1. Raw Material Preparation: Energy Consumption: The manufacturing process does not consume significant amounts of energy, and energy use is often inefficient, leading to higher production costs rather than cost-effective production .","In a modern manufacturing system for furniture production, raw material and material, energy and information flows are directly interconnected to obtain competitive products while increasing the productivity, profitability and environmental performance of the enterprise. In the wood industry manufacturing system, raw wood undergoes physical and biological transformation processes (drying and transformation of the biological properties of wood) as well as disruptive actions that are compensated by the order quantities. Energy as a resource has an important role to play in this production process, and it involves consuming a certain amount of energy. It is one of the biggest and costliest resources involved in the manufacturing process. The required energy is generally transmitted from the outside in the form of electric or thermal energy. From the energy input, only a part becomes useful energy, the rest representing energy losses. By reducing energy consumption, reversing energy losses and integrating materials and material losses into energy recovered through retrofitting, revenue and profit can increase, leading to an increase in employee satisfaction. The easier it is to maximize profits and lower the operating costs, the quicker is the recovery of the investments, and that will change in the operating mode in: ""WORKING SMARTER NOT HARDER""."
i_1876,"Key Findings: 1. Impact of Tree Height on Land Surface Temperature (LST): Vegetation height significantly impacts LST, with taller trees generally providing greater cooling effects. A study using LiDAR data in Tampa, Florida, found that LST decreases at an increasing rate with vegetation height, optimizing at around 25 meters . This suggests that trees around this height are most effective in reducing surface temperatures.","Urban vegetation can mitigate urban heat island (UHI) due to its ability to regulate temperature by directly or indirectly influencing water vapor transport, shading effect, and wind speed and direction. Mechanisms of effects of vegetation cover on land surface temperature (LST) have been extensively documented. Few studies, however, have examined the role of vegetation height in controlling LST. In this study, we examined the relationship between LST and vegetation height by using Light Detection and Range (LiDAR) data from the city of Tampa, Florida, USA. The results revealed that vegetation height has significant impact on LST. Additionally, we also identified the optimal height and fractional cover at which vegetation can exert the greatest influence on LST. In particular, we found that the maximum cooling effect of vegetation can only be achieved when vegetation cover is above 93.33%, an amount of which is nearly impossible to have in most of the cities. On the other hand, LST decreases at an increasing rate with vegetation height, and is optimized at 20 m. This shows that vegetation height can play an important role in regulating UHI in contributing to effect maximization with least cover possible in a city. Findings derived from this study could provide urban planners with critical insights on precise and efficient urban vegetation management in the purpose of UHI mitigation."
i_79,Techniques to Address Imbalanced Data: Ensemble Methods: Boosting: Algorithms like RHSBoost and Boundary-Boost enhance minority class performance by focusing on difficult-to-classify instances .,"Imbalance data are defined as a dataset whose proportion of classes is severely skewed. Classification performance of existing models tends to deteriorate due to class distribution imbalance. In addition, over-representation by majority classes prevents a classifier from paying attention to minority classes, which are generally more interesting. An effective ensemble classification method called RHSBoost has been proposed to address the imbalance classification problem. This classification rule uses random undersampling and ROSE sampling under a boosting scheme. According to the experimental results, RHSBoost appears to be an attractive classification model for imbalance data.
[10]: Imbalanced data existed widely in various fields. The classification problem of imbalanced data is a hot issue in machine learning. Existing algorithms on imbalanced data classification processed data without putting enough attention on the positive boundary samples which were prone to misclassification, and the cost that the positive samples were misclassified is much larger than the cost that the negative samples were misclassified. Based on this background, this paper presented a new imbalanced data classification approach based on boundary samples named Boundary-Boost. At first, categorize positive sample as boundary sample and security sample. Then, synthesize the new positive samples according to the boundary sample to balance the imbalanced data. At the same time, classified all the samples by using Boosting. Next, deleted the synthesized samples which were misclassified to reduce the influence of synthesized error samples on the classification results. Experimental result shows that the approach of Boundary-Boost has advantages on imbalanced data classification problem."

For example, the openHab platform has been shown to suffer from limited device compatibility, which can prevent effective integration of IoT devices . This can result in unauthorized control over surveillance systems.","Internet of Things (IoT) refer to a group of smart devices connected over a common network which can improve the quality of our lives either via automation of various home chores e.g. switching on lights at certain pre-programmed hours or allowing remote control of home appliances. While IoT offers a promising future for automation, convenience and analytics, it currently faces many issues that prevent private industry or residential home owners from deploying them. Two major issues include security concerns and device incompatibilities among different IoT platforms. A recent research paper has exposed the insecurity of the SmartThings framework which allows over privileged access of third party apps to all capabilities of a SmartThings device. This combined with unsafe dynamic method invocation exposes home owners to dangerous manipulations of deployed IoT devices e.g. unlock a home. To overcome this vulnerability, users may choose an open source platform e.g. openHab. However, openHab suffers from limited device compatibility issue since it does not support most of the SmartThings devices.

This approach has been successfully applied in the Bakken Formation for optimizing well completion and spacing .","With hundreds of rigs running and thousands of wells producing in unconventional plays, more and more data becomes available every day and it is ever more tempting to apply machine learning techniques for unconventional development, be it to identify geology sweet spot, understand performance drivers and optimize development strategies such as well spacing, completion and production designs etc. However, most of the previous applications of machine learning are limited to either certain types of data or small areas of interest. Consequently, the results often lack the predictability or generalizability necessary to impact important development decisions. We developed a flexible, scalable and integrated machine learning framework to leverage all sources of data for the goal of optimizing unconventional resources development. The framework is built on a big data warehouse and on-demand capability to efficiently visualize and analyze large volumes of heterogeneous data. The most important pillar of the framework is the ability to transform all different types of data with fit-for-purpose methodologies to be closely related to the evaluation and prediction of well performance. This is enabled mechanistically by an interface to scripting languages such as R or Python for interactive data processing, validation and visualization. We also developed several innovative methodologies to overcome some common challenges in characterizing well performance and analyzing well spatial and temporal relationships in terms of well spacing, stacking and infill timing. Ultimately, all the data is regularized to be ready for machine learning. The framework enables a rich set of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. More importantly, the integration of machine learning with geology, reservoir and development data in a visual environment enables very intuitive and interactive testing, validation and interpretation, which provides valuable insight and confidence for development decision making. The framework has been extensively employed in Permian Basin for important technical studies such as evaluation of new formation, optimization of well completion and spacing, and even PUD reserve booking compatible with SPEE recommended reliable technology. Field case studies clearly demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the framework as well as the predictability and insights the machine learning techniques offer."

Indigenous milk enzymes play a key role in regulating lactogenesis, including active involution of mammary gland. Moreover, they are essential constituents of antioxidation and the innate immune system of milk. Among antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase, catalase and selenium-containing glutathione peroxidase have been demonstrated in human milk. Mainly, the enzyme content of colostrum is higher than that in corresponding mature milk. Beside lipophilic antioxidant in human milk, tocopherols, carotenoids and vitamin A are of great interest. Those components demonstrate the highest levels in colostrum and decline during early lactation, despite the fact that total lipids increase. The complete list of active antioxidant components in human milk is not yet known. This review reports the main findings of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants, as well as antioxidant capacity of human milk. Synergism of action of several antioxidants helps to eliminate free radicals in newborns. Bearing in mind that milk contains a number of antioxidants, many reactions are possible and it is difficult to define the exact contribution and function of each antioxidant. Besides qualitative and quantitative analysis of human milk antioxidants, the measurement of total antioxidant capacity could be a useful tool for examination of this dynamic, complex fluid."
s_1127,"Potential Functions of Collagen-Derived Proline in Bone Metastatic Cancer Dormancy: Collagen-derived proline, particularly through its role in collagen stability and structure, can significantly influence the dormancy and reactivation of bone metastatic cancer cells. Collagen I (Col-I) is a major component of the bone matrix and has been shown to play a critical role in the dormancy-to-proliferation switch of metastatic cancer cells. The interaction between Col-I and cancer cells can activate signaling pathways that lead to cytoskeletal reorganization and cell proliferation .","Breast cancer that recurs as metastatic disease many years after primary tumor resection and adjuvant therapy seems to arise from tumor cells that disseminated early in the course of disease but did not develop into clinically apparent lesions. These long-term surviving, disseminated tumor cells maintain a state of dormancy, but may be triggered to proliferate through largely unknown factors. We now show that the induction of fibrosis, associated with deposition of type I collagen (Col-I) in the in vivo metastatic microenvironment, induces dormant D2.0R cells to form proliferative metastatic lesions through β1-integrin signaling. In vitro studies using a three-dimensional culture system modeling dormancy showed that Col-I induces quiescent D2.0R cells to proliferate through β1-integrin activation of SRC and focal adhesion kinase, leading to extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation by myosin light chain kinase and actin stress fiber formation. Blocking β1-integrin, Src, ERK, or myosin light chain kinase by short hairpin RNA or pharmacologic approaches inhibited Col-I-induced activation of this signaling cascade, cytoskeletal reorganization, and proliferation. These findings show that fibrosis with Col-I enrichment at the metastatic site may be a critical determinant of cytoskeletal reorganization in dormant tumor cells, leading to their transition from dormancy to metastatic growth. Thus, inhibiting Col-I production, its interaction with β1-integrin, and downstream signaling of β1-integrin may be important strategies for preventing or treating recurrent metastatic disease. ©2010 AACR.
[2]: The most frequent site of prostate cancer metastasis is the bone. Adhesion to bone-specific factors may facilitate the selective metastasis of prostate cancer to the skeleton. Therefore, we tested whether prostate cancer bone metastasis is mediated by binding to type I collagen, the most abundant bone protein. We observed that only bone metastatic prostate cancer cells bound collagen I, whereas cells that form only visceral metastases failed to bind collagen. To confirm the relationship between collagen adhesion and bone metastatic potential, a collagen-binding variant of human LNCaP prostate cancer cells was derived through serial passage on type I collagen (LNCaP <inf>col</inf>). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells express increased levels of the integrin collagen I receptor α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> compared with LNCaP cells. Antibodies to the α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> complex inhibited LNCaP<inf>col</inf> binding to collagen, confirming that integrins mediated the attachment. Correspondingly, LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells displayed enhanced chemotactic migration toward collagen I compared with LNCaP cells, an activity that could be blocked with α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> antibodies. To directly test the role of α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf>-dependent collagen binding in bone metastasis, LNCaP and LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells were injected into the tibia of nude mice. After 9 weeks, 7 of 13 (53%) mice injected with LNCaP<inf>col</inf> developed bone tumors, whereas 0 of 8 mice injected with LNCaP cells had evidence of boney lesions. LNCaP<inf>col</inf> cells were found to express increased levels of the metastasis-promoting RhoC GTPase compared with parental LNCaP. We conclude that collagen I attachment mediated by α<inf>2</inf>β<inf>1</inf> initiates motility programs through RhoC and suggest a mechanism for prostate cancer metastasis to the bone. ©2006 American Association for Cancer Research."

The requirements of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn by broiler chickens need to be redefined due to today's fast growing birds and the availability of organic trace minerals. Zn is one of the key trace minerals for chickens and although it maintains a relatively stable tissue concentration, dietary deficiency of Zn strongly depresses the feed intake, and hence the growth, of broiler chickens. Based on studies using a semiconventional diet, it is reasonable to conclude that the total Zn requirement for broiler chickens is around 60 mg/kg up until day 14 and 70 mg/kg from 14 day onwards, including the Zn content in the basal diet. However, it is difficult to determine the requirements of other organic trace minerals such as Cu, Fe and Mn because under a Zn adequate condition, it is impossible to produce deficient symptoms of these minerals on the basis of growth response. It also identifies gaps in knowledge of inorganic and organic trace mineral nutrition for the modern broiler chicken. © 2009 CSIRO."

Comparison with Other Techniques: Deep Learning Approaches: Traditional methods like deep learning approaches require predefined initial conditions and are sensitive to noise and artifacts, which can lead to suboptimal segmentation .","Segmentation of ultrasound images is a challenging task due to the lower contrast and the speckle noise. Active contour is one of the most widely used techniques for ultrasound image segmentation. This method has drawbacks such as the predefined initial curve position and the number of contour points to be considered. A new active contour segmentation for extracting the intima media layer and plaque in the Common Carotid Artery (CCA) ultrasound images is presented in this paper. This paper has proposed a fuzzy weighted graph based active contour segmentation technique to overcome all these drawbacks. The proposed method is used for segmenting Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) and plaque in common carotid artery B-mode ultrasound images to assess the risk of stroke in the human subject under investigation. Using canny edge detection and connected component analysis methods, the initial contour was determined and applied as input to the proposed active contour segmentation algorithm. The proposed algorithm was compared with five conventional methods. Experimental results prove that the proposed approach has produced better results than traditional methods. The overall probability of error achieved by the proposed algorithm was 5.28%, which was very less compared to other conventional methods.
[4]: Uterine fibroids segmentation in ultrasound images is of great importance in the definition of intra-operative planning of ultrasound-guided high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. However, it is challenging to obtain accurate, robust and efficient uterine fibroid segmentation due to low quality of ultrasound images. In this study, the authors propose a novel adaptive localised region and edge-based active contour model using shape constraint and sub-global information to accurately and efficiently segment the uterine fibroids in ultrasound images with robustness against initial contour. The authors first define adaptive local radius for the localised region-based model and combine it with the edge-based model to accurately and efficiently capture image's heterogeneous features and edge features. Then, they incorporate a shape constraint to reduce boundary leakage or excessive contraction to obtain more accurate segmentation. To overcome the initialisation sensitivity, they introduce the sub-global information to prevent the curve from trapping into the local minima and obtain robust results. Furthermore, the authors optimise computation by adaptively sharing local region and employing the multi-scale segmentation method to achieve efficient segmentation. The proposed method is validated by uterine fibroid ultrasound images in HIFU therapy and the results demonstrate that it can achieve accurate, robust and efficient segmentation."

FDAs trained on specific data sets may not perform well in real-world applications without further adjustments and improvements. Additionally, it is possible that incorporating user feedback into the training process could enhance the adaptability of FDAs in diverse operational environments, although this remains to be empirically validated .","Buildings are responsible for a large portion of the overall energy consumption. With the rising penetration of renewable energies, the heating and cooling demand of buildings will be increasingly satisfied by heat pumps. However, faults in the heat pump systems reduce energy efficiency or cause system failure, leading to an increased demand for primary energy. Hence, fault detection algorithms (FDA) are used to identify faults before system failure or efficiency deterioration occurs. With the rise of artificial intelligence and big data as well as more detailed monitoring systems, data-driven FDA have become a focus of research in recent years, showing promising results with acceptable effort. However, studies often use specific training data sets, thus generating FDAs adapted to a specific experimental system. In this paper, we investigate whether FDAs trained on a fault data set gathered with a laboratory heat pump system can be deployed on a real-world application system without the need for expensive modifications. We also investigate a big data approach, in which we use data collected over an extended period of time to train the FDAs. To this end, we use a data set kindly provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) containing data for typical heat pump failures measured on a specially outfitted air-water heat pump. From this data, we extract a series of features as input for the FDAs and evaluate the importance of those features for the FDAs. We train the algorithms to detect faults on the NIST data set, and transfer the fitted FDAs to our own measurement data. The results show that the trained FDAs perform very well on the NIST data set, but poorly on the real-world data set. We identify several reasons for the FDAs' poor performance and derive mitigating actions. We believe that big data approaches for FDAs are facing several issues beyond the simple gathering of large data quantities, especially the labelling of occurred faults and completeness of the data set."

[3]: Global warming which is a natural phenomenon has given rise to climate change as a result of man's contribution to this phenomenon. The roles of humans to global warming in two-fold: Firstly, through industrial activities which have caused increase in the concentration of CO<inf>2</inf> and other green house gases thereby exacerbating the degree of global warming of the Earth's atmosphere to dangerous levels. The second concern is the denuding of Earth's of the Earth's forest; thereby reducing the Earth's potential to absorb the increase in CO<inf>2</inf>. Other effects are loss of biodiversity, desertification, genetic erosion, loss of soil fertility and flooding. The way out of the challenge is basically through adaptation and mitigation.

Decreased ankle pushoff leads to increased hip flexor power absorption, indicating a compensatory relationship between the ankle and hip joints during movement . This implies that ankle discomfort could alter hip joint mechanics and vice versa.","[5] Introduction: Changes occur in muscles and nerves with aging. In this study we explore the relationship between unipedal stance time (UST) and frontal plane hip and ankle sensorimotor function in subjects with diabetic neuropathy. Methods: UST, quantitative measures of frontal plane ankle proprioceptive thresholds, and ankle and hip motor function were tested in 41 subjects with a spectrum of lower limb sensorimotor function ranging from healthy to moderately severe diabetic neuropathy. Results: Frontal plane hip and ankle sensorimotor function demonstrated significant relationships with UST. Multivariate analysis identified only composite hip strength, ankle proprioceptive threshold, and age to be significant predictors of UST (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73), explaining 46%, 24%, and 3% of the variance, respectively. Conclusions: Frontal plane hip strength was the single best predictor of UST and appeared to compensate for less precise ankle proprioceptive thresholds. This finding is clinically relevant given the possibility of strengthening the hip, even in patients with significant peripheral neuropathy. [15] Background: Leg length discrepancy (LLD) is common after total hip arthroplasty (THA) with a plethora of clinical consequences. The associations between symptomatic (sLLD; disturbing perception of anatomical leg length discrepancy), anatomical (aLLD; side difference in leg length between the center of rotation of the hip and the center of the ankle joint) and intraarticular (iLLD; side difference between the tear drop figure and the most prominent point of the trochanter minor) LLD and lower back have not yet been reported in the literature. We performed a retrospective study to answer if postoperative (1) symptomatic LLD, (2) anatomic LLD, and (3) a change in intraarticular leg length are associated with lower back pain in patients undergoing THA. Further, we aimed to answer (4) whether symptomatic LLD is associated with the magnitude of anatomical LLD and the change in intraarticular leg length. Hypothesis: LLD after THA is associated with lower back pain. Materials and methods: Seventy-nine consecutive patients were retrospectively analyzed for the presence of aLLD and iLLD using EOS™ and X-rays, and were interviewed for the presence of sLLD and lower back pain using a questionnaire 5 years after primary THA. Results: Postoperative new onset of lower back pain was reported by 9 (11%) patients. Twenty (25%) patients reported sLLD. Anatomical LLD > 5 mm was present in 44 (56%) (median 8.0 (IQR -3.0 to 12.0; range -22 to 22) mm) and > 10 mm in 17 (22%) (median 12.0 (IQR 11.0 to 16.5; range -22 to 22) mm) patients. iLLD changed > 5 mm in 44 (56%) (median 8.5 (IQR 7.0 to 10.0; range -8 to 18) mm) and > 10 mm in 10 (13%) (median 14.0 (IQR 12.5 to 14.5; range 11 to 18) mm). New onset lower back pain was associated with sLLD (p = 0.002) but not with aLLD or iLLD. Patients without preoperative lower back pain had a statistically significant association between presence of sLLD and an aLLD of > 10 mm (p = 0.01). Conclusions: Symptomatic LLD after primary THA is associated with postoperative new onset of lower back pain irrespective of the magnitude of LLD. In patients without lower back pain prior to THA, symptomatic LLD is associated with anatomical LLD of more than 10 mm. Level of evidence: IV."
s_28,"Benefits: Enhanced Decision-Making: By extracting and structuring relevant clinical information, AI can support healthcare providers in making informed decisions about patient care and follow-up .","In secondary analysis of electronic health records, a crucial task consists in correctly identifying the patient cohort under investigation. In many cases, the most valuable and relevant information for an accurate classification of medical conditions exist only in clinical narratives. Therefore, it is necessary to use natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract and evaluate these narratives. The most commonly used approach to this problem relies on extracting a number of clinician-defined medical concepts from text and using machine learning techniques to identify whether a particular patient has a certain condition. However, recent advances in deep learning and NLP enable models to learn a rich representation of (medical) language. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for text classification can augment the existing techniques by leveraging the representation of language to learn which phrases in a text are relevant for a given medical condition. In this work, we compare concept extraction based methods with CNNs and other commonly used models in NLP in ten phenotyping tasks using 1,610 discharge summaries from the MIMIC-III database. We show that CNNs outperform concept extraction based methods in almost all of the tasks, with an improvement in F1-score of up to 26 and up to 7 percentage points in area under the ROC curve (AUC). We additionally assess the interpretability of both approaches by presenting and evaluating methods that calculate and extract the most salient phrases for a prediction. The results indicate that CNNs are a valid alternative to existing approaches in patient phenotyping and cohort identification, and should be further investigated. Moreover, the deep learning approach presented in this paper can be used to assist clinicians during chart review or support the extraction of billing codes from text by identifying and highlighting relevant phrases for various medical conditions."

s_1573,"Active Compounds in Cocoa Pod Husk: Cocoa pod husk hemicellulose hydrolysate (CPHHH) can be used for the production of xylitol by certain yeast strains, indicating the presence of fermentable sugars and other compounds that support microbial growth .","[10] In Colombia, the cocoa pod husk (CPH) is expected to reach 2 100 000 t year<sup>-1</sup> in 2021 which is usually burned or left over for decomposing outdoors at the plantations without any environmental control. Therefore, this study evaluated the energetic potential of CPH obtained after the initial processing of this fruit (Theobroma cacao L.). Three biological materials were analyzed: clone CCN-51 (CPH<inf>1</inf>), clone ICS-39 (CPH<inf>2</inf>) and a hybrid (CPH<inf>3</inf>), which present high yield and number of fruits per tree. The samples were examined by using different characterization techniques for raw biomass and ashes; in addition to the ultimate, proximate and heating value analyses, different fouling indexes were determined in order to estimate the phenomena of solids formation inside the reactor when combustion or gasification is used as a thermochemical valorization process. The Colombian CPHs contain relatively homogeneous levels of C, H and O, but very heterogeneous ash contents (1.4 to 12.9 wt %). The three studied samples showed high content of K<inf>2</inf>O in ashes (67 to 74 wt %). The higher heating value (HHV) ranged from 15 395 to 16 670 kJ kg<sup>-1</sup>. Furthermore, the fouling index and the fusibility analysis suggest the appearance of agglomeration and sintering phenomena when CPH is used as a fuel. The gasification is proposed as the process with major possibilities for the energetic use of CPH. CPH<inf>1</inf> sample seems to allow a more stable and flexible operation, as compared to CPH<inf>2</inf> and CPH<inf>3</inf>."
s_1970,"Methods for Assigning Weights to Environmental Factors: Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM): Description: AMM calculates the HSI by averaging the suitability scores of different environmental variables. Application: This model was found suitable for predicting Chub mackerel habitat in the East China Sea based on SST, salinity, Chl-a, and SSHA . It can be adapted for skipjack tuna by selecting appropriate environmental variables.","The habitat quality of Chub mackerel (Scomber japonicus) in the East China Sea has been a subject of concern in the last 10 years due to large fluctuations in annual catches of this stock. For example, the Chinese light-purse seine fishery recorded 84000 tons in 1999 compared to 17000 tons in 2006. The fluctuations have been attributed to variability in habitat quality. The habitat suitability Index (HSI) has been widely used to describe fish habitat quality and in fishing ground forecasting. In this paper we use catch data and satellite derived environmental variables to determine habitat suitability indices for Chub mackerel during July to September in the East China Sea. More than 90% of the total catch was found to come from the areas with sea surface temperature of 28.0°-29.4°C, sea surface salinity of 33.6-34.2 psu, chlorophyll-a concentration of 0.15-0.50 mg/m<sup>3</sup> and sea surface height anomaly of -0.1-1.1 m. Of the four conventional models of HSI, the Arithmetic Mean Model (AMM) was found to be most suitable according to Akaike Information Criterion analysis. Based on the estimation of AMM in 2004, the monthly HSIs in the waters of 123°-125°E and 27°30′-28°00′ N were more than 0.6 during July to September, which coincides with the catch distribution in the same time period. This implies that AMM can yield a reliable prediction of the Chub mackerel's habitat in the East China Sea. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009."
s_758,"Obstacles in Shifting to Digital Methods: Technical and Resource Constraints: Digital rendering and modeling can be resource-intensive, requiring significant computational power and specialized hardware .","The Method of Moments (MoM) technique is the backbone of all computational methods for the modeling and simulation of complex systems. With applications including fluid mechanics, electromagnetics, and fracture modeling, MoM is versatile and has laid the foundation for modern optimization methods. Modeling and simulation is absolutely necessary for the success of all complex engineering problems of today. Unfortunately, the size and complexity of some problems cause computations to be extremely time consuming. Even with optimized MoM methods, such as the Fast Multipole Method (FMM), some simulations can take days or weeks to complete with acceptable accuracy. Due to the limitations of traditional CPU hardware, research has been expanding to develop computation methods for Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) hardware. The GPU, which refers to the commodity off-the-shelf 3D graphics card, is specifically designed to be extremely fast at processing large graphics data sets (e.g., polygons and pixels). The computational power of today's commodity GPUs has exceeded that of PC-based CPUs. As the semiconductor fabrication technology advances, GPUs can use this additional hardware capability much more efficiently for computation than CPUs by increasing the number of computational pipelines (database, software networking modules and computational power). Additionally, many of the complex applications for MoM have computational patterns which are easily parallelizable and hence can be accelerated on commodity GPUs, achieving near real-time computation on ordinary PCs and laptops. This means that computational intensive modeling and simulation using GPUs is now becoming a realistic design tool. This paper presents the process and results of creating Method of Moments software that utilizes the parallelization benefits of GPU hardware. Written in a GPU language, CUDA, this software shows great potential for the future of complex modeling and simulation. © 2011 IEEE.
[11]: As the demand for machine learning, edge computing, and the Internet of Things technology increases, computing efficiency and energy consumption has become an important basis for computing choices. Although the graphics processing unit(GPU) has a high degree of parallel computing capability, its energy consumption is large, and the data transmission is limited by the system bus bandwidth. Therefore, our laboratory previously proposed the Brain Memory Architecture prototype architecture, which integrates FPGA and memory as a computing architecture, which has the advantages of high-efficiency, and low-power computing and does not require data exchange through the system bus. Based on this prototype architecture, this paper constructs the Brain Memory Architecture HW/SW Co-Design Platform (BMCD platform) to provide a good user interface so that users can easily build a hardware and software collaborative design computing environment. Through the library provided by the platform to establish the data transmission and calculation between acceleration hardware and memory to solve the bandwidth limitation of the traditional system bus. In this platform, the AXI4-stream interconnect core is provided as a standard interface for data handshaking with acceleration hardware, which reduces user design complexity and maintains the scalability of connection with other computing IP cores. In platform evaluation, design and adaptive CNN algorithm for hardware and software design platform, provide data quantization methods to reduce data bits to reduce the required data bandwidth and storage space and propose a dynamic adjustment algorithm for integer and decimal ratios to correct the accuracy and design problems that may be caused by data quantization. With this adaptive CNN algorithm architecture and BMCD platform to construct a rapid data transmission. This paper finally analyzes the comparison of the weight transmission time of different CNN models with the CPU and the GPU. The method proposed in this paper can reach about 20 times faster than the CPU and about 10 times faster than the GPU."

s_131,Text data mining and pattern recognition can be used to analyze user behavior and optimize library services .,"The main purpose of this paper is to assess and examine the possible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools in Pakistani academic libraries, particularly those areas of library technical and library user services where AI could be applied in the near future. A secondary purpose is to bring the library perspective on AI to the forefront of the scholarly world. This is a self-exploratory study, in which a qualitative approach interview has been conducted with 10 chief librarians/library heads (5 public + 5 private sectors) from universities regarding their views on the adoption of artificial intelligence tools in Pakistani academic libraries. Results are tabulated in a descriptive format. Librarians are aware of AI technologies. Services based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used in libraries, e.g. Google Assistant, Voice Searching, and Google Translate. Pattern recognition methods, such as text data mining, are also used to retrieve library material and conduct online searching. Big data is accessed via services such as cloud computing, OneDrive, and Google Drive. There is a very low level of awareness of robotics and chatbots. This study provides librarians with suggestions as to how AI tools could be used in libraries which either have yet to adopt AI technologies or wish to implement more advanced tools. Pakistani library schools could collaborate with computer science departments to establish AI Labs in the respective library and information science (LIS) departments/libraries. AI challenges funding and technological skills are the key problem to implement with AI in the University Libraries.
[9]: Aim/Purpose The aim of this paper is to analyze various text classification techniques employed in practice, their strengths and weaknesses, to provide an improved awareness regarding various knowledge extraction possibilities in the field of data mining. Background Artificial Intelligence is reshaping text classification techniques to better acquire knowledge. However, in spite of the growth and spread of AI in all fields of research, its role with respect to text mining is not well understood yet. Methodology For this study, various articles written between 2010 and 2017 on ""text classification techniques in AI"", selected from leading journals of computer science, were analyzed. Each article was completely read. The research problems related to text classification techniques in the field of AI were identified and techniques were grouped according to the algorithms involved. These algorithms were divided based on the learning procedure used. Finally, the findings were plotted as a tree structure for visualizing the relationship between learning procedures and algorithms. Contribution This paper identifies the strengths, limitations, and current research trends in text classification in an advanced field like AI. This knowledge is crucial for data scientists. They could utilize the findings of this study to devise customized data models. It also helps the industry to understand the operational efficiency of text mining techniques. It further contributes to reducing the cost of the projects and supports effective decision making. Findings It has been found more important to study and understand the nature of data before proceeding into mining. The automation of text classification process is required, with the increasing amount of data and need for accuracy. Another interesting research opportunity lies in building intricate text data models with deep learning systems. It has the ability to execute complex Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks with semantic requirements. Recommendations Frame analysis, deception detection, narrative science where data expresses a for Practitioners story, healthcare applications to diagnose illnesses and conversation analysis are some of the recommendations suggested for practitioners. Recommendation Developing simpler algorithms in terms of coding and implementation, better for Researchers approaches for knowledge distillation, multilingual text refining, domain knowledge integration, subjectivity detection, and contrastive viewpoint summarization are some of the areas that could be explored by researchers. Impact on Society Text classification forms the base of data analytics and acts as the engine behind knowledge discovery. It supports state-of-the-art decision making, for example, predicting an event before it actually occurs, classifying a transaction as 'Fraudulent' etc. The results of this study could be used for developing applications dedicated to assisting decision making processes. These informed decisions will help to optimize resources and maximize benefits to the mankind. Future Research In the future, better methods for parameter optimization will be identified by selecting better parameters that reflects effective knowledge discovery. The role of streaming data processing is still rarely explored when it comes to text classification."
i_1768,GWP is crucial for climate policies and regulations as it helps in setting targets for GHG reductions and in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies .,"Purpose: The common practice of summing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and applying global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO<inf>2</inf> equivalents misrepresents the global warming effects of emissions that occur over a product or system's life cycle at a particular time in the future. The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
[2]: Energy technologies emitting differing proportions of methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) vary significantly in their relative climate impacts over time, due to the distinct atmospheric lifetimes and radiative efficiencies of the two gases. Standard technology comparisons using the global warming potential (GWP) with a fixed time horizon do not account for the timing of emissions in relation to climate policy goals. Here we develop a portfolio optimization model that incorporates changes in technology impacts based on the temporal proximity of emissions to a radiative forcing (RF) stabilization target. An optimal portfolio, maximizing allowed energy consumption while meeting the RF target, is obtained by year-wise minimization of the marginal RF impact in an intended stabilization year. The optimal portfolio calls for using certain higher-CH<inf>4</inf>-emitting technologies prior to an optimal switching year, followed by CH<inf>4</inf>-light technologies as the stabilization year approaches. We apply the model to evaluate transportation technology pairs and find that accounting for dynamic emissions impacts, in place of using the static GWP, can result in CH<inf>4</inf> mitigation timelines and technology transitions that allow for significantly greater energy consumption while meeting a climate policy target. The results can inform the forward-looking evaluation of energy technologies by engineers, private investors, and policy makers."

However, these methods evaluate only the pavement surface or estimate the quality of each layer. In this study, we developed a technique for three-dimensionally diagnosing the causes and degrees of pavement damage. A 3-D crack analysis of each sample was conducted using a CT scanner and a 3-D void analysis program. 3-D images of in-situ specimens showed that longitudinal cracking occurred not from the surface or bottom, but from within the pavement. The technique can thus be used to directly identify the 3-D pavement damage of each layer; it can easily and precisely diagnosis the position and level of damage in asphalt concrete pavement."

There are 3 types of traditional dairy foods, namely the butter-like product minyak samin; yogurt-like product dadih; and cheese-like products dali or bagot in horbo, dangke, litsusu, and cologanti, which reflect the culture of dairy product consumption in Indonesia.
[6]: This review revisits the Indonesian Bakso, a restructured meat product that is well preferred by wide ranges of social economy classes of the Indonesian community. Bakso has been a very good low-cost protein source for all. By understanding the complexity of the colloidal structure of Bakso that is constructed by the protein matrix and swelling starch granule interactions, it is also made clear in this review that Bakso has the potential for being more than just a low-cost protein source meal enjoyed by all. The colloidal complexities of the food system in Bakso allows it to entrap fortifications of bioactive compounds, bringing Bakso to the realm of functional foods. Various simple attempts have been made to improve the eating quality of Bakso by simple substitution of the starch with other plant-sourced starches that have functional properties. Effectiveness of these attempts had not scratched the surface of elevating Bakso into the functional food world, therefore it is an opened option to explore the potential of bringing encapsulation of functional components in this mini review processes into the mix. The variables in terms of bioactive functions, sources, polarities, solubilities and reactivities of the various compounds and encapsulating materials is still a large opportunity for further exploration. With encapsulation in play, this opens the doors of refitting Bakso with more varieties of bioactive compounds, and the elements of modifications that can be made to elevating Bakso in the functional food world."
s_548,"Corrosion Resistance: FRC does not suffer from corrosion issues that affect steel rebar, which is a significant advantage in reducing long-term maintenance costs .","Civil infrastructure around the world is in a state of utter disrepair and significant efforts are needed on the part of all stakeholders to render our failing infrastructure back to a serviceable and safe state. The root of the problem is at the apparent lack of durability in our construction materials, inability on part of the owners to provide timely maintenance, absence of advanced condition assessment tools and lack of long-lasting, cost effective repair materials and technologies. This paper will present data to support the argument that fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is an ideal material for achieving these goals.

[10]: A continued process exists to implement innovative materials to enhance the sustainability and durability of the built infrastructure. Technologies developed over the last two decades have facilitated the use of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites as internal reinforcement bars (rebars) for concrete structures, which have proven to be an alternative to traditional steel reinforcement due to significant advantages, such as magnetic transparency and, most importantly, corrosion resistance, equating to durability and structural life extension. This study evaluated the durability of three different commercially available and most commonly used GFRP rebar types for resistance to aggressive environments, such as those experienced in coastal areas. In total, 216 specimens were exposed to seawater, at various temperatures (23, 40 and 60°C) for different time periods (60 and 120 days). The durability of these GFRP rebars was assessed by testing five different physio-mechanical properties, including: tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, transverse and horizontal shear strength, and bond-strength to concrete. Preliminary results show that the durability of the GFRP rebars after being exposed to seawater at different temperatures, varies considerably among the three different rebar types. Among the tested physio-mechanical properties, tensile strength suffered the highest degradation."
s_500,"Circularization of Bed Material: Particle Size Distribution (PSD): The behavior of bed materials in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers is significantly influenced by the particle size distribution. Smaller particles tend to have higher surface concentrations of elements like calcium (Ca), which is less volatile and thus remains in the bed material .","In this paper, the effect of the particle size distribution (PSD) of the bed material on alkali and alkaline earth metal behavior in circulating fluidized bed combustion of solid-recovered fuel was studied. The Sauter mean diameter, of the PSDs studied: Gaussian-, flat-, binary-, and narrow distributions, was 200 µm. The concentration of both alkali and alkaline earth metals was found to decrease with increasing particle size, both on the surface and the cross-section, except for the surface concentration for calcium (Ca) which showed the opposite trend for the Gaussian and flat PSDs, increasing from approximately 1.7%-w to above 3%-w. The total surface concentration varied from 2.1% for the binary PSD to 2.6% for the flat, while the cross-section concentration varied from 0.4% for the Gaussian PSD to 0.7% for the binary. Ca is less volatile than the other elements studied making it less prone to vaporize and leave the circulating fluidized beds with the flue gases and it was also the most abundant element in the fuel. The experimental results presented here indicate smaller variation in potassium, sodium, and magnesium behavior between the PSDs than for Ca and that particle size changing phenomena, such as attrition, influence it as well."
s_2139,"MPs are generated from the degradation of larger plastic debris through chemical, physical, and biological processes .","The presence of microplastics (MPs) in the atmosphere is becoming a global obstacle with infinite impacts on human health, agriculture, wildlife, and ecosystems. MPs are generated by the chemical, physical, and chemical degradation processes of plastic debris in roadside dumps and domestic waste. MPs that have contaminated the soil, sand, and water are reemitted into the atmosphere by the wind. Roadside dust is a major source of airborne microplastics. The aerodynamic shape of MPs favors long-distance transport, and pollution plumes also facilitate their transport and deposition. The abundance of airborne MPs depends on aerodynamics and environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, human population density, local environment, and human activities. Wet and dry depositions of MPs contaminate water sources and food sources in the environment. Long-term ingestion of MPs into the human body via inhalation can adversely affect health. Additional field sampling and the implementation of standardized analytical protocols are required to identify the global distribution of atmospheric MPs and their potential effects on human health. This chapter discusses the sources, occurrence, pathways, and fate of airborne MPs in the environment, as well as their atmospheric chemistry. The potential health consequences of human MP exposure are discussed.
[2]: Microplastics (MP) are frequently detected in both aquatic (marine and freshwater) and atmospheric environments. The size of MP is usually < 5 mm. MP are considered as emerging contaminants. This chapter critically analyzes the recent developments on the occurrence and distribution of MP in aquatic and air environments. Extensive use of plastic products and improper management of plastic wastes lead to generation of MP upon exposure to environmental conditions. Environmental fate and transport of MP depend on their physical characteristics (size and density), existing aquatic conditions (water current and turbulence) and prevailing weather conditions (sunlight, rainfall and wind speed). MP exert ecotoxicity to aquatic biota, respiratory ailments upon inhalation of polluted air, and bioaccumulation in the food chain. Potential control strategies for reduction of MP levels in water and air include use of biodegradable plastic products, enhancement of plastic recycling contributing to circular economy, and removal through adsorption. Key knowledge gaps and future research directions are highlighted."
i_1399,"Comparative Data: Key Points: Detection Bias: The increase in reported cases is primarily due to improved detection and diagnostic capabilities, suggesting that the actual incidence of brain tumors is not rising significantly .","In children, brain and spinal cord tumors account for approximately 25 % of all cancer (40–50 % of all pediatric solid tumors). Overall, they are second only to the leukemias in frequency. There have been reports of an increasing incidence of both adult and pediatric brain tumors which may, in part, be due to ""detection bias"" although some epidemiology groups suggest that the increases are real. The annual incidence is approximately 2–5 cases per 100,000 (1 in 2500 children aged 0–16), which translates to approximately 300–400 new cases being diagnosed in the UK per year.
[5]: Child mortality has declined remarkably during the last decades. While neonatal disorders, diarrhoea, pneumonia, and malaria as well as being underweight account for most of the child deaths worldwide, children's health discussions in Europe and the USA focus on other issues such as asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders, male genital malformations, and childhood cancer. There is clear evidence of increasing rates of asthma in various countries during the last decades, although rates in some countries may now have stabilised or even decline as recent UK data indicate. Although an increase in the frequency of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and attention deficit disorder has frequently been discussed, the limited data in this field does not justify such a conclusion. While geographic heterogeneity regarding reproductive outcomes is apparent, global trends have not been identified. Interpretation of the available information on asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders and reproductive outcomes is hampered by inconstant diagnostic criteria over place and time and the lack of good and comprehensive population-based surveillance data, which makes it impossible to ascertain trends in actual disease frequency. Data indicate that developed countries have a gradually increasing incidence in leukaemia with a corresponding drop in the incidence of lymphoma. Increases in brain tumour frequency may be related to the development and wide application of new diagnostic capabilities, rather than a true change in the incidence of malignant disease. With a better prognosis for childhood cancer survival, secondary cancers following chemotherapy appear to be increasing. A wide range of environmental factors is thought to have an impact on children's health. These factors include nutrition (protein, vitamins, antioxidants), lifestyle and behaviour choices such as tobacco and alcohol use, parental health, socio-economic status, choice of living environment (urban versus rural, etc.), and parent-sibling behaviour.

i_1091,"Ethnic Differences: Ethnic background can influence the relationship between fat mass and insulin resistance. For instance, African Americans exhibit higher insulin resistance compared to Caucasians, even with similar body fat percentages. This is attributed to differences in fat distribution and adipocyte size .","Objective. South Asians are susceptible to insulin resistance even without obesity. We examined the characteristics of body fat content, distribution and function in South Asian men and their relationships to insulin resistance compared to Caucasians. Research Design and Methods. Twenty-nine South Asian and 18 Caucasian non-diabetic men (age 27,±3 and 27±3 years, respectively) underwent euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp for insulin sensitivity, underwater weighing for total body fat, MRI of entire abdomen for intraperitoneal (IP) and subcutaneous abdominal (SA) fat and biopsy of SA fat for adipocyte size. Results. Compared to Caucasians, in spite of similar BMI, South Asians had higher total body fat (22±6 and 15±4% of body weight; p-value<0.0001), higher SA fat (3.5±1.9 and 2.2±1.3,kg, respectively, p-value=0.004), but no differences in IP fat (1.0±0.5 and 1.0±0.7 kg, respectively, p-value=0.4). SA adipocyte, cell size was significantly higher in South Asians (3491±1393 and 1648±864 μm2; p-value=0.0001) and was inversely correlated with both glucose disposal rate (r-value= -0.57; p-value=0.0008) and plasma adiponectin concentrations (r-value=-0.71, p-value<0.0001). Adipocyte size differences persisted even when SA was matched between South Asians and Caucasians. Conclusions, Insulin resistance in young South Asian men can be observed even without Increase in IP fat mass and is related to large SA adipocytes size. Hence ethnic excess in insulin resistance in South Asians appears to be related more lto excess truncal fat and dysfunctional adipose tissue than to excess visceral fat. © 2007 Chandalla et al.
[7]: Background: South Asians have a high prevalence of insulin resistance, which predisposes to type 2 diabetes. Rationale: In the current study, we examined whether insulin sensitivity in South Asian men and men of European descent (Europids) relates to truncal and lower body fat, number of adipocytes, and cell size distribution. Results: Fifteen South Asian men and 15 Europid young men with comparable body mass indexes completed assessments of insulin sensitivity, body composition analysis by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and measurement of adipocyte cellularity in the subcutaneous abdominal (truncal) and gluteal (lower body) adipose tissue. The South Asians and the Europids had similar total body fat and fat contents in truncal and lower body regions. Compared to the Europids, the South Asians had a greater insulin resistance shown by fasting insulin, area-under-the-curve for postprandial insulin, oral glucose insulin sensitivity, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, A-cell index, and triglyceride-tohigh- density lipoprotein ratio. The South Asians had similar number of adipocytes to the Europids, but the South Asians had significantly higher ratios of small-to-larger adipocytes. The South Asians further had a higher fraction of very large adipocytes. In both South Asians and Europids, truncal fat was positively associated with insulin resistance. In the South Asians but not in the Europids, lower body fat was associated with severity of insulin resistance. Conclusions: The results suggest first, a higher ratio of small-to-larger adipocytes in the South Asians consistent with a lesser lipid storage capacity of adipose tissue; and second, the positive association of lower body fat with insulin resistance in the South Asians implies that fat in their lower body worsens insulin resistance. This association was not observed in the Europids. © 2012 American Federation for Medical Research."
s_1561,"Ecological Impact: The color polymorphism in Iris lutescens, primarily due to the presence of anthocyanins, significantly alters visual discrimination by pollinators such as bumblebees, suggesting that the color difference is the sole factor influencing pollinator behavior .","We describe a flower color polymorphism in Iris lutescens, a species widespread in the Northern part of the Mediterranean basin. We studied the biochemical basis of the difference between purple and yellow flowers, and explored the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such difference, in particular visual discrimination by insects, a potential link with scent emitted and the association between color and scent. Anthocyanins were found to be present in much greater concentrations in purple flowers than in yellow ones, but the anthocyanin composition did not differ between color morphs. Likewise, no quantitative difference in anthocyanin content was found between vegetative tissues of the two morphs. Floral anthocyanins were dominated by delphinidin 3-O-(p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside (also called delphanin) and its aliphatic derivatives. Small amounts of delphinidin 3-O-(p-caffeoylrutinoside)- 5-O-glucoside and its aliphatic derivatives were also characterized. Based on a description of bumblebees' (one of the main pollinators of I. lutescens) color perception, purple and yellow flowers of I. lutescens could be visually discriminated as blue and blue-green, respectively, and likely by a wide variety of other insects. The overall chemical composition of the scent produced was not significantly different between morphs, being dominated by terpenoids, mainly myrcene, (E)-β-ocimene and limonene. A slight color-scent correlation was nevertheless detected, consistent with the shared biosynthetic origin of both pigments and volatile compounds. Therefore in this species, the difference in the amounts of pigments responsible for flower color difference seems to be the major difference between the two morphs. Pollinators are probably the main selective agent driving the evolution of flower color polymorphism in I. lutescens, which represents a suitable species for investigating how such polymorphism is maintained. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Social perceptions of climate change and water pressures are a key issue in the public's acceptance of adaptation measures. Furthermore, the existing risk for crop production is not necessarily correlated with the farmers' awareness of that threat. This paper focuses on coffee producers' perception of risk and adaptive capacity for coffee crops in Nicaragua in response to climate change and water availability. We aim to analyze how dependent the producers are on water resources, and if this reliance affects their perception of risk and their expectations with regard to public and private support for dealing with adaptation. A survey of 212 representative farmers of the national population of farms in the country's two most important production areas was conducted for this purpose. We consider socio-economic and biophysical variables to explain the farmers' perceptions. Our findings show that experience and technical capacity are relevant to the adaptive capacity although smallholders do not always show high concern and their expectations with regard to external support are very low. The paper can be useful to prioritize the measures necessary for a greater level of involvement from stakeholders.
[6]: Climate change impacts threaten farmers' livelihoods and global food security. Adaptation to climate change can protect both farmers and our food supply. Structurational divergence theory (SD theory) provides a holistic framework to understand the unique contexts of groups impacted by climate change and to reveal constraints and opportunities for adaptation efforts. We apply SD theory to climate change adaptation, focusing on a population of Colombian coffee farmers in Risaralda who are impacted by climate change. Our findings reveal a SD cycle blocking successful adaptation. Climate change impacts exacerbate farmers' pre-existing financial strain and threaten their livelihoods, yet they lack the information and political and structural support needed to take action. This impedes development and creates a downward spiral of immobilization; the farmers will continue to be unprepared for climate change and practice inconsistent adaptation efforts until structures shift to provide them with the information and resources needed for successful adaptation."

The aim of this study was to compare the impact of an interdisciplinary family (FI) Vs individual intervention (II) on glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR), pancreatic β-cell function and cardiovascular risk markers in patients with prediabetes, as well as to measure the impact on their families' metabolic risk. Methods: Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) to compare the impact of FI and II on IR and pancreatic β-cell function in subjects with prediabetes. There were 122 subjects with prediabetes (and 101 family members) randomized to FI or II. Data were collected in 2015-2016 and analyzed in 2017-2018. FI group had the support of their family members, who also received personalized diet and exercise recommendations; patients and their family members attended monthly a lifestyle enhancement program. II group received personalized diet and exercise recommendations. The follow-up was for 12 months. Glucose, IR, pancreatic β-cell function and secondary outcomes (body composition and lipid profile) were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Results: FI group improved area under the glucose curve (AUC) (from 18,597 ± 2611 to 17,237 ± 2792, p = 0.004) and the Matsuda index (from 3.5 ± 2.3 to 4.7 ± 3.5, p = 0.05) at 12 months. II group improved Disposition Index (from 1.5 ± 0.4 to 1.9 ± 0.73, p <.0001) at 12 months. The improvements achieved in weight and lipids at 6 months, were lost in II group at 12 moths, whereas in FI persisted. Adherence up to 12 months was not different between the study groups (FI 56% Vs II 60%). Conclusions: FI intervention was more effective by improving glucose AUC, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile, besides that, metabolic risk in family members of the FI group was maintained, while the risk of II group was increased.

i_2335,"Key Mechanisms: Enzymatic Activity: Cystathionine β-lyase: Overexpression of the STR3 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae likely leads to increased release of aromatic thiols during fermentation, which may enhance the tropical fruit characters in wines, although this effect is not universally observed .","Sulfur-containing aroma compounds are key contributors to the flavor of a diverse range of foods and beverages. The tropical fruit characters of Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sauvignon blanc wines are attributed to the presence of the aromatic thiols 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol (3MH), 3-mercaptohexan-1-ol-acetate, and 4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one (4MMP). These volatile thiols are found in small amounts in grape juice and are formed from nonvolatile cysteinylated precursors during fermentation. In this study, we overexpressed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene, STR3, which led to an increase in 3MH release during fermentation of a V. vinifera L. cv. Sauvignon blanc juice. Characterization of the enzymatic properties of Str3p confirmed it to be a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-dependent cystathionine β-lyase, and we demonstrated that this enzyme was able to cleave the cysteinylated precursors of 3MH and 4MMP to release the free thiols. These data provide direct evidence for a yeast enzyme able to release aromatic thiols in vitro that can be applied in the development of self-cloned yeast to enhance wine flavor. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology."
i_1875,"Conclusion: While the abstracts do not provide a specific LCA of clay brick powder, they highlight the environmental impacts associated with clay brick production and the benefits of using alternative materials. Key areas of focus include reducing emissions, improving resource efficiency, and adopting circular economy practices to enhance sustainability in the brick manufacturing sector .","The life cycle assessment of the ABC (Pvt) Ltd brick manufacturing plant has considered land use, fossil resource scarcity, water consumption, global warming and fine particulate matter formation as the impact categories for assessment, with clay mining and coal as the input flows with the highest significant contributions to environmental load. The phase of clay mining (65.8%) is significantly impacting on all the investigated impact categories followed by brick moulding (24.8%) and brick roasting (9.4%) phases, respectively. Hotspots were assessed to identify potential for resource efficiency and circular economy at ABC bricks, Zimbabwe. It can be concluded that ABC is severely polluting the air with emissions above the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) standards for SO<inf>2</inf>, CO, PM and NO<inf>x</inf> thus putting kiln workers at risk of respiratory diseases. The calculated Air Quality Index (AQI) ranks CO as the most affecting pollutant with an average score of ∼600. Clay production efficiency was also determined, and an analysis revealed that extrusion and clamping stage contributed highly to the clay losses during brick moulding. Therefore, focus must be placed on these process steps to reduce raw material losses. Furthermore, an environmental waste (fly ash) was used in different weight percentage ratios of 10%, 20% and 100% to substitute clay. The increase of the fly ash content in the brick making process proved to significantly reduce the environmental load among the selected impact categories. ABC uses clay as its main raw material hence the high demand for clay. Strategies should include accounting of used clay daily and raw materials substitution. If ABC uses fly ash from its brick kilns and from other thermal power plant boilers to mix with clay in brick production, then the quantity of clay demanded will be reduced. Using fly ash will reduce rate of clay extraction while at the same time solving the problem of fly ash disposal in Zimbabwe. This circular option will ultimately result in reduced pit expansion, hence reducing top-soil loss and environmental degradation. It should not be disregarded that top-soil loss in turn affects food security. By adopting appropriate technologies, implementing resource efficiency, and designing circular economy patterns, the brick manufacturing sector in Zimbabwe may not only reduce production waste but also comply with enforced environmental protection legislation.
[2]: Manufacturing of bricks, using clay or fly ash, is one of the major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions as their manufacturing involves utilization of coal and cement. To overcome this limitation, alternative construction materials are developed by author using industrial and agro wastes like cotton mill waste, recycled paper mill waste, and rice husk ash. This work aims at performing a sustainability assessment of burnt clay bricks and bricks made of industrial and agro wastes used for brickwork in a low-cost house. The criteria considered for the assessment are economic, environmental, social, and technical aspects for manufacture of bricks and use of different bricks for brickwork. For the evaluation of environmental criterion, a life cycle assessment (LCA) tool is used. Overall sustainability index (SI) is calculated for alternatives based on the various criteria using MIVES approach. The relative SIs of clay and fly ash bricks, were 0.25 and 0.26, respectively. Overall, bricks made of industrial and agro wastes are found more sustainable with the highest SI for cotton waste bricks (0.94). Sensitivity analysis also confirmed that brickwork from waste based bricks is more sustainable compared to brickwork made from clay brick or fly ash brick.
[3]: Background, Goal and Scope. The ceramic tile industry is one of the most important industries in Spain, with the highest concentration of firms to be found in the province of Castellón on the Mediterranean coast. The basic input material for this industry is red clay. The aim of this study was to carry out an LCA of the process of mining, treating and marketing this clay in order to identify the stages and unit processes that have the greatest impact on the environment. This LCA examines all the stages of the red clay from cradle to the customer's gate, including the process of mining and treating the clay in the mining facilities and its later distribution to end users. Methods. Life cycle inventory (LCI): An exhaustive LCI was performed by collecting data from the mine run by Watts Blake Bearne Spain, S.A. (WBB-Spain) in Castellón. Inputs and outputs were collected for all the unit processes involved in the mining, treatment and marketing of the clay: - Mining the clay, which embraces the unit processes of removing the layer of vegetation covering the chosen area, preparing the area to allow access for the firm's vehicles, and boring or blasting the place the clay is to be extracted from. - Treating the clay that is mined to make the finished product, which entails all unit processes required to separate out the waste material and transport it to the tip (which will later be reconditioned), excavating and transporting the clay to the crushing plant and later storing it in heaps before delivery to customers. All the internal transport that takes place between each unit process has also considered. - Distribution of the final product, where the clay is loaded onto dumper trucks and delivered to the customer. Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA): According to ISO 1404X standards, the LCIA is performed at two levels. Firstly, the emissions accounted for in the inventory stage are sorted into impact categories to obtain an indicator for each category (mandatory elements). Secondly, the weighting of environmental data to a single unit is applied (optional elements). In compliance with ISO 14042, a sensitivity analysis is performed and three different impact assessment methods (Eco-Indicator'95, EcoIndicator'99 and EPS'2000) are applied in order to analyse their influence on the results. Results. The processes that involve the movement of clay within the mine (excavation and loading and transport to the crushing facilities and heaps) are the ones that make the greatest contribution to impact categories for pollutant emissions. As weighting methods in LCA remain a controversial issue, a recommendation when robust results are required, can be to use several methods to examine the sensitivity of the results to different values and worldviews. In our application case, in spite of the differences between the three impact assessment methods applied (Eco-Indicator'95, Eco-Indicator'99 and EPS'2000), the same conclusions can be established from the environmental point of view and we can conclude that the ultimate results are not sensitive in the transformation of mid-points to end-points. Discussion. Taking into account the characteristics of the product being analysed, in addition to the impact categories for pollutant emissions that are traditionally considered in LCA studies, environmental parameters related to resource use (fuel, electricity and water consumption), waste generation (dangerous and non-dangerous wastes) and land use (natural resource appreciation and land use efficiency) and its later rehabilitation (degree of rehabilitation) have been defined. These parameters can be used as additional criteria for an environmental product declaration or criteria for a future eco-labelling of red clay. Conclusion. The results of this study made it possible to identify the unit processes that make the greatest contribution to environmental impact that being, specifically, excavation and loading and transport to the crushing facilities and heaps. Such processes are directly related to the fuel consumption, category that faithfully reproduces the environmental profile of most of the impact categories related to pollution emissions. Special interest has the consideration of additional parameters to quantify the land use and its later rehabilitation. Recommendations. The ceramic tile industry has a basis to market and promote tile products with improved environmental impacts. Given that transport and extraction are dominant underlying issues, it is quite likely that such environmental improvements are also win-win in the economic sense. The availability of exhaustive life cycle inventories is the key to allow this industry to, rapidly, incorporate LCA during product development. Complimentary life cycle costings would also be relatively minimal in terms of effort. Perspectives. Although this study performs the LCI for the basic raw material (clay), future studies should be conducted to complete an LCI for the remaining elements employed by the ceramic tile industry, with the aim of developing a characteristic LCI database for this industry. This includes data on raw materials (feldspar, silicious and feldspars sand, boron, glaze, frit, etc.) and processes (enamelling, firing, water waste treatment, etc.). © 2007 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).
[4]: The establishment of sustainability credentials of emergent construction materials is very subjective, and most available tools such as BREEAM, CEQUAL, ARUP SpeAR among others are not fully quipped or equipped at all to deal with individual material systems. The main problem emanates from the challenges of the audit of each aspect of the material processing, and especially the quantification of the relevant transport, energy, environmental and other inputs into the composite product. Incorporation of materials with long and complex recycling processes further exacerbate the challenge. This paper reports on a simplified approach towards full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of seven clay-based brick products developed in UK and in Spain, based on known material data and estimated energy inputs in the manufacturing processes. In order to test the robustness of the proposed approach, results on UK-based bricks are compared with a parallel LCA on clay-based product developed in Spain. Finally, the clay-based products are compared with a typical Portland cement-based concrete block and fired clay brick. In the LCA, boundary conditions include fixed transport, thus attempting to factor only the (i) material ingredients, (ii) their known atmospheric emissions, and (iii) estimated energy inputs during processing. Results suggest that the most challenging aspect in the undertaking of LCA is the availability of reliable input data. Results also show that there are numerous parameters that can reliably and corroboratively facilitate the comparison of performance, besides carbon dioxide emissions."

However, some thin pavements fail due to severe wetting-up of the subgrade. thus requiring additional substructure strengthening and (or) drainage systems. This research investigated the laboratory characterization and in situ field mechanical behaviour of full-depth reclaimed and cement-stabilized granular materials in conjunction with a woven geotextile and sand drainage system. This research showed that the integration of cement-stabilized reclaimed granular materials with a geotextile separation layer and sand drainage system significantly improved the mechanical primary response and climatic durability properties of the reclaimed road structure. The cement-stabilized and geotextile separation-drainage system improved the structural asset management test results from a completely failed road structure to primary plus load-carrying capacity.

Valproate was discontinued and therapy with levetiracetam was initiated. 2 days later, we observed severe anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopenia, which were attributed to levetiracetam. Although she recovered soon after the treatment was discontinued, it took 2 weeks for cell counts to return to normal."

Industrial Processes and Waste Management: Cleaner Production: Industrial engineering can implement cleaner production audits to optimize resource and energy use, reduce emissions, and achieve significant environmental and economic benefits. For example, in the cement manufacturing industry, cleaner production led to substantial savings and reduced environmental impact .","The rapid development of the magnesia refractory industry has caused serious problems of resource and energy waste and environmental pollution. Cleaner Production and Cleaner Production Audit are considered effective tools for energy conservation and emission reduction in the industry. This study presents an application of cleaner production and cleaner production audit in a typical large-scale magnesia raw material production plant in Liaoning, China and the results of their implementation. Through the 7 steps of a cleaner production audit (planning and organization, pre-assessment, assessment, option generation and screening, feasibility analysis, implementation, and maintenance of cleaner production), the resource and energy consumption and environmental emissions of the enterprise are investigated, the key auditing procedures are identified, and the cleaner production opportunities are analyzed. 28 cleaner production options, including raw material and energy substitution, technology improvement, facility maintenance and updates, process optimization and control, waste reutilization, management, and staff training and motivation, have been developed and implemented in a feasible way. After complete implementation of these options, great environmental and economic benefits are expected to be achieved: increased utilization of magnesite tailing powder by 281,000 t per year; annual savings of 25,000 t of magnesite ore; savings of 384,000 kW h of electricity; a 21.7% reduction in magnesite consumption per ton of FM product; improvement of the wastewater utilization rate from 70% to 100%; the removal of dust, SO<inf>2</inf> and NO<inf>x</inf> emissions produced by burning coal or producer gas; savings of 1.066 million USD per year. The results demonstrate that implementing cleaner production can not only bring huge environmental benefits, but also significant economic gains. Moreover, factory staff have recognized the benefits that cleaner production can bring to the plant, and plan to continue the process. Since there are few studies on the application of cleaner production in the magnesia refractory industry, this paper provides scientific guidelines for its implementation in other similar enterprises, and a theoretical and practical basis for promoting the sustainable development of the industry."
s_1359,"Aerobic Exercise: While combining aerobic exercise with a caloric deficit may reduce visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, it is likely that this approach is the only effective method for achieving such results, as other forms of exercise do not seem to contribute significantly to fat loss .","ABSTRACT: Purpose: To determine whether a hypocaloric diet alone (WL) or with exercise training (AEX + WL) is effective in improving body composition, fitness, glucose utilization and CVD risk factors in sedentary women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) and with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Materials and Methods: Longitudinal clinical investigation of 25 overweight/obese (BMI: 32 ± 1 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) women (59 ± 1 yrs) with a GDM history (n = 20) or T2DM (n = 5). Women completed 6 months WL (n = 10) or AEX+WL (n = 15) with VO<inf>2max</inf>, body composition, and glucose tolerance testing. Insulin sensitivity was measured during the last 30 min of 2 h hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (40 mU·m<sup>−2.</sup>min<sup>−1</sup>) before and after interventions. Results: Body weight decreased ~7% after WL and AEX+WL (p < 0.001), with an 11–12% decrease in fat mass (p < 0.0001). Visceral fat and subcutaneous abdominal fat decreased 27 and 10% after WL (p < 0.01) and 14 and 11% after AEX + WL (p < 0.05). VO<inf>2max</inf> increased 16% after AEX + WL (p < 0.001) and did not change after WL. Glucose AUC decreased 14 and 13% after WL (p < 0.05) and AEX + WL (p < 0.01) with a 42% decrease in insulin AUC after AEX + WL (p < 0.01). Glucose utilization increased 25% (p = 0.05) with AEX + WL and 7% with WL. Conclusions: A six-month aerobic exercise program combined with moderate weight loss reduces body weight, visceral and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and improves insulin sensitivity in older women who had previously been diagnosed with GDM and those with T2DM. These findings should encourage women with a history of GDM to engage in an active lifestyle and reduce caloric intake to lower the risk for the development of T2DM.
[3]: Introduction: Menopause seems to be among the factors related to the development of prediabetes and central obesity. Conversely, physical activity may have a major role in reducing metabolic syndrome in women of postmenopausal age. Material and methods: Forty-eight postmenopausal active and sedentary women within the ages of 45-65 years were randomized to four groups: 1) high-intensity concurrent interval exercise (HCI; n = 15), 2) moderate-intensity continuous concurrent exercise (MCC; n = 14), 3) control daily active (CDA; n = 10), and 4) control sedentary (COS; n = 9). The subjects in the preceding training groups exercised three times per week for 50-65 min/session with high/moderate concurrent exercise for 10 weeks. The levels of serum irisin, insulin sensitivity, abdominal fat distribution (visceral and subcutaneous), and total abdominal fat were measured at baseline and post-test. Results: This study showed that the HCI group had a significantly increased serum irisin (p < 0.001), stimulated favorable alterations in insulin sensitivity status (p = 0.003), and significantly decreased subcutaneous, visceral and, total abdominal fat (p < 0.001). Also, the insulin sensitivity status was significantly increased (p = 0.01) and subcutaneous abdominal fat significantly decreased in the MCC group (p = 0.018). However, this study's results did not find a considerable correlation between insulin sensitivity, irisin level, weight loss and abdominal fat distribution. Conclusions: High-intensity concurrent exercise has a greater influence on improving most metabolic-related parameters than moderate-intensity concurrent exercise."

Study design: A total of 53 women who self-reported having had at least one child with OI completed the survey. We evaluated pregnancy length, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) usage, at-birth complications, and the child's clinical information including OI type, height and weight. Results: Information was gathered on a total of 77 children (60 type I, 4 type III and 13 type IV). Health conditions reported at birth included breech presentation (24%), prematurity (27%), fracture (18%), bone deformity (18%) and respiratory problems (22%). Approximately 31% (n = 24) received NICU care. There was a significant association between younger maternal age, preterm delivery and NICU admission. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that newborns with OI appear to be at high risk of skeletal disorders, preterm delivery and breech presentation. Younger maternal age and preterm delivery seem to be strong predictors of the need for NICU care. Our data suggest that pregnant women with OI younger than 20 years of age may benefit from added clinical supervision in anticipation of adverse effects on their child."
i_1798,"Qualitative Metrics: Metrics that capture aspects of CE design that are not easily quantifiable, such as resilience and robustness .","Current Circular Economy (CE) frameworks applied to product chains exhibit notable shortcomings. These include neglecting the resilience and robustness of design, requiring detailed economic and environmental data for impact assessment, and relying on qualitative rather than quantitative metrics capturing certain CE design aspects. In the current contribution, we addressed these shortcomings by developing an Ecologically inspired (Eco-inspired) Framework using the mathematical foundations of Ecological Network Analysis (ENA). While ENA metrics have previously found application in designing circular economies, particularly in Industrial Symbiosis (IS) networks, our adaptation tailors these metrics for use in product-level CE, recognizing the inherent distinctions between product-level CE and IS. Our Eco-inspired Framework comprises three key categories to provide holistic and granular-level metrics for designing product-level CE. The first set of metrics assesses circularity and resource efficiency. The second set gauges network intensity and robustness as complementary indicators ensuring a CE is both sustainable and resilient. The third group of metrics evaluates enhancement potential of CE strategies through introducing quantitative metrics for measuring the degree of closed-loop strategies and average circularity level of a CE design. The three comprehensive set of indicators within the Eco-inspired Framework uniquely captures various facets of circular design, whether originating from technological innovations and recovery improvement at the end of life (EoL), shifts in human consumption patterns, alterations in product design, or changes in business models. The framework's application is tested in designing a CE for multilayer Polyethylene-Polyamide (PE-PA) films. Using the Eco-inspired Framework, we identified the best strategy for designing a resilient and sustainable CE for PE-PA films. A diverse set of EoL strategies along with a reduction in product consumption can improve circularity and resilience by 650% and 255%, respectively, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. The framework minimizes trade-offs between sustainability and circularity goals and offers insights on how to enhance each strategy for achieving a resilient and sustainable CE for products."

Through 144 weeks, 50 of 487 participants without baseline nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor resistance by population sequencing (efavirenz/ tenofovir/emtricitabine, n = 19; efavirenz/zidovudine/lamivudine, n = 31) experienced virologic failure (>400 copies/ml). Here, we analyzed whether the presence of low levels of K103N at baseline correlated with virologic failure. Methods: Available baseline plasma samples (n = 485) were amplified and tested for K103N using an allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) assay with a lower detection cut-off of 0.5%. Results: Sixteen of 476 (3.4%) evaluable participants had low-level K103N at baseline by AS-PCR (0.8-15%). The abundance of the K103N subpopulation at baseline distinguished individuals with virologic failure from those who responded durably to efavirenz-containing therapy. Among six participants with at least 2000 K103N copies/ml before treatment, five experienced virologic failure, compared with only one virologic failure among 10 who had less than 2000 K103N copies/ml (P = 0.008). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that K103N viral load at least 2000 copies/ml increased the risk of virologic failure with an odds ratio of 47.4 (95% confidence interval 5.2-429.2, P = 0.0006). Conclusion: The presence of K103N mutant virus in plasma above 2000 copies/ml prior to therapy in treatment-naive individuals correlated with increased risk of virologic failure of these efavirenz-containing triple-drug regimens. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

The corporate firms and governments believe that the pressure on the environment can be reduced by implementing the circular economic system. The switching of a linear economy to a circular economy requires to build new business models that overcome the limitations of the linear model of the economy. This paper aims to rank the business models for the successful adoption of the circular economy through the criteria by employing an appropriate multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) method. Fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (Fuzzy TOPSIS) has been used in this study. Eleven Business Models have been identified through literature review and analyzed based on nine criteria for the business model to be successful. The ranking of results indicates that the product and process design is the most important business models for the implementation of the circular economy. The findings of this research enhance the understanding about the relative importance of the several business models based on which the management can formulate an effective strategy to systematically adopt an appropriate business model for successful implementation of an economic system.

[5]: Stunting, adolescent fractures, and osteoporosis later in life are all public health problems that may be eradicated with adequate nutrient intake in preschool diets. Preschool children's nutrient consumption was studied using the weighed food intake method. Demographic data were obtained using a questionnaire. A total of 116 preschool children in 9 villages formed the population for the study. Data were analyzed using EPI Info version 3.3.2 and the SPSS software package. The preschoolers' mean intake of protein (17.0 g) and energy (1068 kcal) was lower than Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO)—recommended intake, and calcium (474 mg) was lower than the Food and Nutrition Board—recommended intake. Zinc intake (9.9 mg) marginally met basal dietary requirements for zinc as recommended by WHO in a low-bioavailability diet. When subjects were separated according to age group, the nutrient intake of protein and calcium increased with age, but it was not statistically different (P < .05).

These technologies have enabled more accurate and efficient processing of natural language, leading to better results in tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis .","Natural language is ubiquitous in the workflow of medical imaging. Radiologists create and consume free text in their daily work, some of which can be amenable to enhancements through automatic processing. Recent advancements in deep learning and ""artificial intelligence"" have had a significant positive impact on natural language processing (NLP). This article discusses the history of how researchers have extracted data and encoded natural language information for analytical processing, starting from NLP's humble origins in hand-curated, linguistic rules. The evolution of medical NLP including vectorization, word embedding, classification, as well as its use in automated speech recognition, are also explored. Finally, the article will discuss the role of machine learning and neural networks in the context of significant, if incremental, improvements in NLP."

Engaging aspects of Hispanic culture, such as family values and community support, contributed to the program's success .","Filipino Americans have more adolescent pregnancies than other Asian-Pacific Islanders (APIs). Few community-academic collaborations have addressed adolescent pregnancy prevention in this community. We sought to describe the lessons learned from and impact of a community-based teen pregnancy prevention program for Filipino Americans implemented by a Filipina pediatrics resident. We formed a community-academic partnership between the Filipino Youth Coalition, a community-based organization (CBO) in San Jose, California, and the Stanford School of Medicine's Pediatric Advocacy Program. We developed a culturally tailored parent-teen conference addressing adolescent pregnancy prevention in Filipino Americans. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated this intervention by collecting both pre- and post-conference data using a convenience sample design. Engaging particular aspects of Filipino culture (i.e., religion and intergenerational differences) helped to make this community-academic partnership successful. For physicians-in-training who are conducting community-based participatory research (CBPR), project challenges may include difficulties in building and maintaining academic- community relationships, struggles to promote sustainability, and conflicting goals of ""community insiders"" and ""academic outsiders."" Authors offer insights and implications for residents interested in practicing CBPR. CBPR is a key tool for exploring health issues in understudied populations. CBPR experiences can provide meaningful educational opportunities for physicians-in-training and can build sustained capacity in CBOs. They can also help residents to develop analytic skills, directly affect the health of the communities they serve, and, for minority physicians, give back to the communities they call home."
i_412,"Key Characteristics: Scalability: Cloud platforms offer virtually unlimited storage and computing resources, accommodating the vast amounts of data generated by IoT devices, and it is anticipated that future advancements in AI will further enhance the efficiency of data processing in cloud-IoT integrations .","Cloud computing and the Internet of things (IoT) are two diverse technologies having complimentary relationship. The IoT generates massive amounts of data, and cloud computing provides a pathway for that data to travel to its destination. In the modern era, by integrating cloud computing and the Internet of things, a new paradigm has been introduced, i.e., cloud of Things. Cloud-based Internet of Things or cloud of things arose as a platform for intelligent use of applications, information in a cost-effective manner. Both technologies help to raise efficiency in the future. But the integration of these two technologies is challenging and bears some key issues. Therefore, this paper provides a brief investigation of cloud of things concept. In this paper, we review the literature about integration, to analyze and discuss the need behind integration in various applications. In the end, we identify some of the issues and challenges for future work in this promising.
[3]: Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect the real world made up of devices, sensors and actuators to the virtual world of Internet in order to interconnect devices with each other generating information from the gathered data. Devices, in general, have limited computational power and limited storage capacity. Cloud Computing (CC) has virtually unlimited capacity in terms of storage and computing power, and is based on sharing resources. Therefore, the integration between IoT and CC seems to be one of the most promising solutions. In fact, many of the biggest companies that offer Cloud Services are focusing on the IoT world to offer services also in this direction to their users. In this paper we compare the three main Cloud Platforms (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure) regarding to the services made available for the IoT. After describing the typical architecture of an IoT application, we map the Cloud-IoT Platforms services with this architecture analyzing the key points for each platform. At the same time, in order to conduct a comparative analysis of performance, we focus on a service made available by all platforms (MQTT middleware) building the reference scenarios and the metrics to be taken into account. Finally, we provide an overview of platform costs based on different loads. The aim is not to declare a winner, but to provide a useful tool to developers to make an informed choice of a platform depending on the use case."
s_2021,"Stakeholder Involvement: Increasing the knowledge and involvement of various stakeholders, including policymakers and fishers, in climate adaptation and mitigation efforts is crucial .","Indonesia is among the most affected regions by climate variability and change. Located between the Pacific and the Indian Ocean, Indonesia is mostly influenced by some climate variabilities, such as the monsoon, El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These climate variabilities affect significantly on the Indonesian rainfall that further increase the chances of crop failure, specifically on the tobacco yield over Temanggung Regency which is known as the producer of good quality tobacco in Indonesia. Tobacco needs a sufficient dry condition prior to the harvest stage due to maintains its productivity and leaf quality. This ideal condition could be achieved when the dry season, typically in the mid of the year for Temanggung, is not affected by any wet climate variability. Moreover, based on this study, it was found that there was the most remarkable decline in tobacco productivity in 2016 since the required dry condition was interrupted by the prolonged significant rainfall which depicted by strong mid-year negative-IOD indices. The analysis utilized the dataset of tobacco productivity, daily rainfall intensity, and the indices of monsoon, ENSO, and IOD for the period of seven years, from 2010-2016. This study concludes that the climate variabilities give a huge contribution to the profitable tobacco cultivation. Furthermore, efforts to adapt and to mitigate the impacts of the climate variability in Indonesia, specifically for the agriculture sector, is needed by way of increasing the various stakeholder's knowledge that involved in policy planning and decision-making as well as involving the farmers in the training on climate adaptation and mitigation."
i_1544,"While hosting social activities at the grassroots level may enhance community involvement, it is likely that such activities alone will completely solve the issues of solid waste management without the need for formal government intervention .","It is crucial to achieve effective solid waste management involving not only formal/ government agencies, but also individual/informal/voluntary actions in order to create a healthy environment. This study conducted to unveil the factors that increase individuals' community participation in solid waste management policy. The data were matched with a literature review on existing waste policies to identify gaps in knowledge, which could provide beneficial policy recommendations for the Jakarta Provincial Government. The ordinary least squares regression and Indonesian family life survey data were used. The respondents' waste handling and participation scores with potentially affected variables were calculated and regressed. Out of 1.791 respondents, the regression revealed that the participation of individuals from Jakarta is influenced by 1) the frequency of their involvement in social community activities, 2) their education level, and 3) per capita expenditure. The solid waste management score increased by 0.233 if the respondents were more socially active, with a participation score of 1. Empowerment had a 0.06 coefficient correlation relative to the waste handling score. According to the broader sample of 28.967 respondents from large cities in Indonesia. It was concluded that individuals' participation could be enhanced by hosting various social activities at the grassroots level. The study's gaps show that the Jakarta Provincial Government has a high propensity towards increasing individuals' participation in solid waste management by maximizing control of the factors mentioned above (especially empowerment), as well as by raising the frequency of citizens' involvement in social community activities at the grassroots level."
s_155,"Utilization of PPO in Financial Data Analysis: PPO is used in algorithmic trading systems to optimize trading strategies. For instance, it has been applied to high-frequency ethereum transactions, where the transaction process is modeled as actions, returns as rewards, and prices as states . This approach could be adapted for gold trading by treating gold prices similarly.","The emerging cryptocurrency market has lately received great attention for asset allocation due to its decentralization uniqueness. However, its volatility and brand new trading mode has made it challenging to devising an acceptable automatically-generating strategy. This study proposes a framework for automatic high-frequency bitcoin transactions based on a deep reinforcement learning algorithm — proximal policy optimization (PPO). The framework creatively regards the transaction process as actions, returns as awards and prices as states to align with the idea of reinforcement learning. It compares advanced machine learning-based models for static price predictions including support vector machine (SVM), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), temporal convolutional network (TCN), and Transformer by applying them to the real-time bitcoin price and the experimental results demonstrate that LSTM outperforms. Then an automatically-generating transaction strategy is constructed building on PPO with LSTM as the basis to construct the policy. Extensive empirical studies validate that the proposed method perform superiorly to various common trading strategy benchmarks for a single financial product. The approach is able to trade bitcoins in a simulated environment with synchronous data and obtains a 31.67% more return than that of the best benchmark, improving the benchmark by 12.75%. The proposed framework can earn excess returns through both the period of volatility and surge, which opens the door to research on building a single cryptocurrency trading strategy based on deep learning. Visualizations of trading the process show how the model handles high-frequency transactions to provide inspiration and demonstrate that it can be expanded to other financial products."
i_2008,"Benefits and Challenges: Benefits: Enhanced Sustainability: By considering ecological interactions and carrying capacities, ecosystem-based approaches can lead to more sustainable aquaculture practices .","Predicting the effects of aquaculture development for coastal ecosystems remains challenging, particularly for data-limited systems, and tools that account for complex ecological interactions are needed to support ecosystem approaches to aquaculture. Here, we used qualitative network models (QNMs) to examine the potential community effects of increasing bivalve aquaculture in South Puget Sound, a large estuarine system in Washington, United States. QNMs are formalized conceptual models that require only a qualitative understanding of how variables composing a system interact (that is, the sign of interactions: +,-, and 0) and are therefore well-suited to data-limited systems. Specifically, we examined community-wide responses to scenarios in which bivalve cultivation effort increased for three different bivalve species (Manila clam Venerupis philippinarum, Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, and geoduck Panopea generosa). Further, we evaluated community-wide responses to the removal of benthic bivalve predators, a future increase in nutrient loadings, and combinations of these scenarios acting simultaneously. The scenarios enabled identification of potential trade-offs between increased aquaculture and shifts in the abundance of community members and assessment of the possible effects of different management actions. We also analysed the QNM to identify key interactions that influence the sign outcome of community responses to press perturbations, highlighting potential points for management intervention and linkages deserving of more focused quantitative study. QNMs are mathematically robust and highly flexible, but remain underutilized. We suggest that they may serve as valuable tools for supporting ecosystem approaches to aquaculture.
[2]: This paper presents an ecosystem modelling approach aimed at improving shellfish aquaculture management by explicitly considering natural benthic biodiversity. This methodology uses a combination of benthic field survey data, sediment and bathymetric mapping, physiological models and dynamic ecosystem modelling. The Wild species Integration for Shellfish Ecoaquaculture (WISE) approach helps to understand the baseline food requirements for maintaining natural benthic biodiversity of suspension-feeding organisms, thus informing managers on potential upper thresholds for shellfish aquaculture. WISE was tested in four coastal systems in Europe and China, including bays, estuaries and sea loughs with widely differing aquaculture activities. In the European systems, where the aquaculture industry is developing, species diversity and abundance are much higher and suspension-feeding wild species play an important role in the consumption of food resources. Densities of wild individuals were estimated to be 13 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Sanggou Bay (total: 2 × 10<sup>9</sup>), 33 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Xiangshan Gang (total: 122 × 10<sup>9</sup>), 95 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Carlingford Lough (total: 4.62 × 10<sup>9</sup>) and 175 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Loch Creran (total: 2.62 × 10<sup>9</sup>). Total clearance rates by wild populations were calculated as 5% of the total volume d<sup>- 1</sup> in Sanggou Bay (75 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>), 11% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Xiangshan Gang (434 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>), 40% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Loch Creran (93 - 99 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>) and 45% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Carlingford Lough (170-250 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>). In relative terms, wild populations play a more important role than cultivated shellfish in clearing suspended particles from the European systems due to the much lower aquaculture activity. 56% and 76% of total primary production in Loch Creran and Carlingford Lough, respectively, are consumed annually by wild organisms, while less than 50% is consumed in Chinese systems (45% in Sanggou Bay and 2.9% in Xiangshan Gang). Integration of the WISE approach within broader ecological modelling illustrates some of the trade-offs between commercial aquaculture and the conservation of biodiversity, showing that rates of and capacities for shellfish culture are reduced when both wild and cultured suspension-feeding species are considered in relation to the available seston. When food resources are partitioned between wild and cultivated species, there is a decrease in individual length and weight (9 to 22% reduction in shell length and 24 to 52% reduction in total fresh weight for the Pacific oyster; reductions of 6% in length and 20% in weight for blue mussel; reductions of 4% in length and 13% in individual weight for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang), resulting in a lower aquaculture production (e.g. for Pacific oyster, a reduction of 12.5% in Carlingford Lough, 34% in Loch Creran and of 9% for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

s_226,"- **Implicit Learning Tasks**: Implicit learning tasks can measure implicit learning of grammar rules, which can be useful for assessing language learners' grammatical knowledge. However, the reliability of these tasks for individual assessments is moderate and may not be sufficient for precise evaluations . Despite this, implicit learning tasks can still provide valuable insights into learners' implicit grammar knowledge.","Implicit learning can be defined as learning without intention or awareness. We discuss conceptually and investigate empirically how individual differences in implicit learning can be measured with artificial grammar learning (AGL) tasks. We address whether participants should be instructed to rate the grammaticality or the novelty of letter strings and look at the impact of a knowledge test on measurement quality. We discuss these issues from a conceptual perspective and report three experiments which suggest that (1) the reliability of AGL is moderate and too low for individual assessments, (2) a knowledge test decreases task consistency and increases the correlation with reportable grammar knowledge, and (3) performance in AGL tasks is independent from general intelligence and educational attainment.
[2]: Artificial grammar learning (AGL) is one of the most extensively employed paradigms for the study of learning. Grammaticality is one of the most common ways to index performance in AGL. However, there is still extensive debate on whether there is a distinct psychological process which can lead to grammaticality knowledge. An application of the COVIS model of categorization in AGL suggests that grammaticality might arise from a hypothesis-testing system (when grammaticality is appropriately balanced with other knowledge influences), so that prefrontal cortex damage should be associated with impaired grammaticality and intact chunk strength performance. This prediction was confirmed in a study of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and matched controls. The TBI patient cohort had diffuse prefrontal cortex damage as evidenced by the history of their injury, CT scans, and severe executive functioning problems. Our results allow a novel interpretation of grammaticality and AGL in general. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Chronic Nature of Ulcers: The chronic nature of DFUs means that they are often open and exposed for extended periods, providing an environment conducive to bacterial growth and odor .","Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common complication of diabetes and present a significant health risk to patients, as well as impose a large economic burden. Evaluation for contributory factors that may impact general health or healing, such as hyperglycemia, peripheral artery disease, neuropathy, and nutritional status, is of the utmost importance. Management of DFUs requires involvement of a multidisciplinary team and a standardized approach to patient care. Standard therapy for DFUs includes offloading and debridement. Assessment and control of infection are critical, including determining the severity of the infection, which may drive therapeutic approaches. For recalcitrant ulcers, adjuvant therapies are used to hasten the healing process, and newer therapies are under investigation.

While variable power splitters exist, they are rarely used in practical applications and do not significantly enhance flexibility in managing power distribution in optical networks .","Fiber optical power splitters (OPSs) have been widely employed in optical communications, optical sensors, optical measurements, and optical fiber lasers. It has been found that OPSs with variable power ratios can simplify the structure and increase the flexibility of optical systems. In this study, a variable-fiber OPS based on a triangular prism is proposed and demonstrated. By adjusting the output beam width of the prism, the power ratio can be continuously tuned. The optical simulations show that the horizontal displacement design is better than the traditional tilt angle design. Our scheme combines a dual-fiber collimator, a focus lens, and a triangular prism with a vertex angle of 120°. By changing the axial displacement of the prism, the power splitting ratio can be altered from 50:50 to 90:10. The polarization and wavelength dependence of the variable OPS were also investigated.
[4]: This paper describes the design of a variable optical power splitter which splits input optical signal power into variable ratios between two output ports. The proposed design is a hybrid scheme which uses a conventional Digital Spatial Light Modulator (DSLM) and a tunable focus Electrically Tunable Lens (ETL). The proposed splitter has an inherent dual-mode of operation and is capable of operating in a DSLM-only, ETL-only or a hybrid DSLM/ETL mode depending on the desired accuracy of the power split ratio. We show that the improved power splitter design can potentially offer a fine split ratio control through additional ETL focal length control. Moreover, it eliminates the need of ascertaining an exact random image pattern through hit-and-trial for an exact split ratio in a DSLM-only splitter mode. The DSLM is used to obtain the closest value to the desired split ratio using a fixed circular pattern with a variable radius while the ETL is tuned for further fine-tuning the split ratio in order to get closer to the required value. We also show that a dual-mode control delivers multiple possible solutions for any desired split ratio. Experimental results validate the working of the proposed splitter design."

Millet products are gaining importance due to increased awareness among consumers of their health benefits. Pearl millet can be used in a variety of different forms, including porridge, breads, fermented and nonfermented beverages, snacks, popped grain, etc. In this study, ready-to-mix traditional pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) porridge powder was developed by adapting different drying methods. The study examined the effects of drying food samples at different temperatures and durations: 60 °C for 48 hours in a tray dryer, −45 ± 5 °C for 48 hours in a freeze dryer, and 40 °C for 48 hours in a vacuum dryer. Pearl millet porridge powder is analyzed in terms of texture, water activity, color, water-holding capacity, pasting properties, and proximate composition. The results were tested statistically by one-way ANOVA. The results indicated that the freeze-drying technique retained its quality. The sensory analysis by a 9-point hedonic scale conducted for porridge powder with 15 semi-trained panelists indicated that the sample dried by freezing was more preferred."

However, the statistically significant effects of traffic cameras in regard to incident management are still unclear to policy makers. This paper used real field data to test whether traffic cameras as independent devices have significant effects on freeway traffic incident detection, verification, and response. The traffic camera as the impact factor and field data are classified into two groups. After the possibility of using the parametric analysis of variance was excluded because of the nonnormal distribution of the field data, a nonparametric method, the Mann–Whitney U test, was used to examine the effects of traffic cameras on incident management. Traffic cameras as the impact factor were found to have statistically significant effects on freeway traffic incident detection, verification, and response. The analysis results in this paper can help policy makers understand the effects of traffic cameras better and can also help to promote the effectiveness of decision making in investing in video surveillance systems.

i_1061,General Antibiotic Options for UTIs: 1. Fosfomycin: Frequently recommended for uncomplicated UTIs due to its high efficacy and low resistance rates .,"Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are a growing concern due to limited therapeutic options. Gram-negative bacteria, specifically Enterobacteriaceae, are common causes of both community-acquired and hospital acquired UTIs. These organisms can acquire genes that encode for multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including extended-spectrum-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC- β -lactamase, and carbapenemases. The assessment of suspected UTI includes identification of characteristic symptoms or signs, urinalysis, dipstick or microscopic tests, and urine culture if indicated. UTIs are categorized according to location (upper versus lower urinary tract) and severity (uncomplicated versus complicated). Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance necessitate judicious use of antibiotics through the application of antimicrobial stewardship principles. Knowledge of the common causative pathogens of UTIs including local susceptibility patterns are essential in determining appropriate empiric therapy. The recommended first-line empiric therapies for acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy adult nonpregnant females is a 5-day course of nitrofurantion or a 3-g single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine. Second-line options include fluoroquinolones and β-lactams, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Current treatment options for UTIs due to AmpC- β -lactamase-producing organisms include fosfomycin, nitrofurantion, fluoroquinolones, cefepime, piperacillin–tazobactam and carbapenems. In addition, treatment options for UTIs due to ESBLs–producing Enterobacteriaceae include nitrofurantion, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, cefoxitin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. Based on identification and susceptibility results, alternatives to carbapenems may be used to treat mild-moderate UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftazidime-avibactam, colistin, polymixin B, fosfomycin, aztreonam, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline are treatment options for UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Treatment options for UTIs caused by multidrug resistant (MDR)-Pseudomonas spp. include fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, colistin, ceftazidime-avibactam, and ceftolozane-tazobactam. The use of fluoroquinolones for empiric treatment of UTIs should be restricted due to increased rates of resistance. Aminoglycosides, colistin, and tigecycline are considered alternatives in the setting of MDR Gram-negative infections in patients with limited therapeutic options.
[2]: Empirical and prolonged antimicrobial treatment of urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli is associated with the emergence of bacterial resistance, and not all countries have strict policies against the indiscriminate use of drugs in order to prevent resistance. This cross-sectional and retrospective study (2010–2015) aimed to evaluate the sensitivity and resistance of patient-derived E. coli to different drugs broadly used to treat urinary infections in Brazil: ampicillin + sulbactam, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, and nitrofurantoin. We obtained 1654 E. coli samples from ambulatory patients with disease symptoms of the urinary tract from a Brazilian public hospital. While all antibiotics were effective in killing E. coli to a large degree, nitrofurantoin was the most effective, with fewer samples exhibiting antibiotic resistance. We assessed the costs of generic and brand name versions of each antibiotic. Nitrofurantoin, the most effective antibiotic, was the cheapest, followed by the fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin), ampicillin + sulbactam and, lastly, cephalothin. Finally, assessment of antibiotic resistance to fluoroquinolones over the study period and extrapolation of the data led to the conclusion that these antibiotics could no longer be effective against E. coli-based urinary infections in approximately 20 years if their indiscriminate use in empirical treatment continues.
[3]: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a very common reason for consultation and prescription in current practice. Excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics in treating urinary tract infections is responsible for the emergence and spread of multiresistant uropathogenic bacteria. Aim of the study: To evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains isolated at the Marrakech region. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study over a period of three years (from 1st January 2010 to 31 December 2012). It included all non-redundant uropathogenic E.coli strains isolated in the microbiology laboratory of the Avicenne hospital of Marrakech, Morocco. Results: During this study, 1472 uropathogenic enterobacteriaceae were isolated including 924 non-repetitive E.coli strains, an overall isolation frequency of 63%. Antibiotic resistance of isolated E.. coli strains showed resistance rates to amoxicillin (65%), sulfamethoxazole-triméthropime (55%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (43%), ciprofloxacin (22%), gentamicin (14%), nitrofurans (11%), amikacin (8%) and fosfomycin (7%). The number of E.. coli strains resistant to C3G by ESBL production was 67, an average frequency of 4.5% of all isolated uropathogenic enterobacteria. The associated antibiotic resistance in the case of ESBL-producing E.coli were 82% for ciprofloxacin, 76% for sulfamethozole trimethoprim, 66% for gentamicin and 56% for amikacin. No resistance to imipenem was recorded for the isolated E.coli strains, which represents an imipenem sensitivity of 100%. Conclusion: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogenic E.. coli strains limits treatment options and therefore constitutes a real public health problem. The regular updating of antibiotic susceptibility statistics of E.coli strains allows a better adaptation of the probabilistic antibiotic therapy to local epidemiological data. Level of evidence: 5.
[4]: Objective: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial diseases in elderly patients. The objective of this study is to determine the antibiotic resistance rates against first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections in elderly patients at our hospital, and use the results as guidance for empirical antibiotic therapy. Methods: In this study, data on all elderly patients aged 65 and older who were followed and treated in our hospital between March 2010 and March 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: 406 microorganisms were isolated from the urine cultures of 401 patients included in the study, because 5 (1.2%) patients harbored two microorganisms. Of the 406 microorganisms, 320 (78.8%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 72 (17.7%) were Gram-positive cocci and 14 (3.5%) were Candida spp. Escherich-ia coli (n=262, 64.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=27, 6.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=17, 4.1%) were the most common among Gram-negatives, and Enterococcus faecalis (n=36, 8.9%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=25, 6.2%) were the most common among Gram-positives. Susceptibility rates of E. coli strains were 89% for nitrofurantoin, 81% for trime-thoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 77% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 70% for gentamicin and 66% for ciprofoxacin. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance must be monitored at each hospital in order to make correct choices for empirical antibiotic therapy. Surveillance studies are helpful for this purpose. In conclusion, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa-zole can safely be used for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infections in elderly patients.

Methods: A retrospective chart review of 154 patients with positive urine cultures from January to June 2016 were reviewed for inclusion in the study. Patients were excluded if less than 18 years of age, hospitalized, discharged from the ED without antibiotics or diagnosed with pyelonephritis. Patient demographics, uropathogens isolated, in-vitro susceptibility to commonly prescribed oral antibiotics (nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim), and antibiotics selected for treatment were recorded. Results: One hundred patients were included in the final analysis. Of the 106 bacterial isolates, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Group B Streptococcus accounted for 62.5%, 8%, and 8% of pathogens, respectively. Overall susceptibilities were 88.1%, 87.9%, 85.4%, and 70.6% for nitrofurantoin, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, respectively. Escherichia coli was most susceptible to nitrofurantoin at 96.9% followed by cefazolin at 94%. Ciprofloxacin was the most prescribed antibiotic followed by cephalexin, nitrofurantoin and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Conclusions: Based on bacterial susceptibility patterns, nitrofurantoin and cephalexin are reasonable first line agents in the empiric treatment of urinary tract infections identified in the emergency department. The most frequently prescribed antibiotic was ciprofloxacin, highlighting the importance of implementing antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and designing specific tools and educational programs for the emergency department targeted at minimizing fluoroquinolone use."
i_616,Provides smooth and adaptive assistance. Can be combined with Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) for enhanced muscle activation .,"Sit To Stand (STS) movement is an important daily living activity and usually a difficult task to achieve, particularly, by post stroke patients. In this study a hybrid control approach that combines the use of an impedance-based exoskeleton controller and an event-based Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the knee extensor muscle to assist the STS transfer movement within an assistance as needed strategy. Actuation of the active lower limb exoskeleton is done using a Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA) that uses a torsion spring to guarantee the measurement of the human exoskeleton interaction torque. The measured torque is fed to a linear desired impedance model to generate a desired trajectory, which will be tracked by the exoskeleton's actuators. Experiments were conducted with one healthy subject to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained performances show the synergy between the assistance provided through FES of the quadriceps muscle during the extension sub-phase of the STS movement and the one delivered by the knee joint actuator of the lower limb exoskeleton."
i_365,"Popular Agile Methodologies: Extreme Programming (XP) focuses on improving software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements through practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration .","Agile methods have transformed the way software is developed, emphasizing active end-user involvement, tolerance to change, and evolutionary delivery of products. The first special issue on agile development described the methods as focusing on feedback and change. These methods have led to major changes in how software is developed. Scrum is now the most common framework for development in most countries, and other methods such as extreme programming (XP), elements of lean software development, and Kanban are widely used. What started as a bottom-up movement among software practitioners and consultants has been taken up by major international consulting companies who prescribe agile development, particularly for contexts where learning and innovation are key. Agile development methods have attracted interest primarily in software engineering1, 2 but also in a number of other disciplines including information systems and project management.
[3]: Agile practices are considered as a major attraction for global software development (GSD) projects owing to its flexible nature. Beside the major benefits it offers to GSD, there are few challenges that hinders its implementation across the global software industry. This study contributes in constructing a systematic literature review for exploring the major factors impacting the agile adaptation at global level. We have identified and analyzed 28 research studies (2015-2019). These selected studies have revealed Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP) as the most popular agile practices that are adapted irrespective of the software type and organizational structure. Furthermore 5 tool categories are also presented i.e. modeling, requirement elicitation, data tracking tools etc. that are commonly used while practicing agile. The major findings of this study conclude that these agile methodologies are heavily adapted due to their iterative model and quick code delivery but basic challenges like poor customer involvement and lack of documentation are badly affecting its growth at global level.
[4]: A survey conducted on the agile software development methods and techniques, which are gaining increasing attention within the IT industry is discussed. The survey reports show that organizations such as Shine Technologies have adopted the agile method such as Extreme Programming (EP), Scrum, Agile MSF, AUP, and in particular FDD. The organization has also adopted agile development techniques such as Test Driven Development (TDD) or pair programming. Agile database development techniques including database refactoring and database regression testing are also beginning to attract attention. The survey shows that the adoption on agile approaches to software development has successfully affected the overall productivity and the quality of the systems that they delivered. Agile software development's focus on collaborative techniques, such as active stakeholder participation and increased feedback, have also helped to improve stakeholder satisfaction."
i_1615,COD Removal: Efficiency: IFAS systems are highly effective in removing COD. Studies have reported COD removal efficiencies ranging from 78.8% to over 92% .,"The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and C/N ratio on the biological removal of carbon and nitrogen using an Integrated Fixed-film Activated Sludge (IFAS) reactor for nearly half a year. The results showed that the efficiency of organic matter removal was greater than 90% regardless of the value of the C/N ratio. Nitrogen removal was affected by the C/N ratio. Indeed, at a C/N ratio equal to 10, nitrogen removal efficiency was maximum with an average removal of 96.54%, 86.1% for ammonium and total nitrogen, respectively. Conversely, with a C/N ratio of 4, removal rate dropped significantly. Indeed, the average ammonium and total nitrogen removal were of 82% and 53%, respectively. An important nitrogen removal rate was achieved when the operating DO concentration was maintained between 1.0 and 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. The impact of the packing material and Mixed Liquor Suspended Solid (MLSS) concentrations on oxygen transfer was determined experimentally. In fact, up to 23% increase in the values of the mass transfer coefficient was observed after the addition of a packing material inside the reactor. However, an increase in the MLSS led to a decrease of the oxygen transfer coefficient.
[3]: In this study, by inoculating nitritation suspended sludge, simultaneous nitritation, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) was established quickly in an integrated fixed-biofilm activated sludge (IFAS) reactor to treat high-ammonia municipal wastewater. Results showed that, deep-level total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies (92.8% and 78.8%, respectively) were achieved, and their effluent concentrations were 13.2 and 39.3 mg/L, respectively. Excess generation of nitrate was once occurred under continuous aerobic condition, but it could be solved by suppressing nitrite oxidizing bacteria activity stably via switching to intermittent aeration mode (alternate 7 min of aerobic and 21 min of anoxic) and rising influent ammonium concentration temporarily (lasted 31 days). High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that, Candidatus_Brocadia, as dominant anammox bacteria, was self-generated in flocs (2.93%) but mainly biofilm (7.67%), whereas uncultured_f_Nitrosomonadaceae as ammonia oxidizing bacteria was mainly found in flocs (2.4%). This work not only demonstrated that anammox bacteria could be self-generated and retained in the SNAD-IFAS system, but also suggested a promising application of the SNAD-IFAS in wastewater treatment plants.
[8]: In this study, performance of Integrated Fixed-film Activated Sludge (IFAS) system in treatment of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS), and oil & grease in synthetic greywater and effect of Organic Loading Rates (OLRs) on removal efficiency within a period of 105 days were investigated. Present study was carried out in a pilot scale under such conditions as temperature of 30 ± 1 °C, dissolved oxygen of 2.32 ± 0.91 mg/l, pH of 8.01 ± 0.95 and OLRs of 0.11–1.3gCOD/L.d. Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were employed to specify rate of the biofilm formed on the media inside the reactor IFAS. The best removal efficiency for COD, LAS and oil and grease were respectively obtained as 92.52%, 94.24% and 90.07% in OLR 0.44gCOD/L.d. The assessment of loading rate indicated that with increased OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, removal efficiency of COD, oil and grease was increased while with increased OLR, removal efficiency was decreased. In doing so, based on the statistical test ANOVA, such a difference between removal efficiencies in diverse OLRs was significant for COD (p = 0.003), oil and grease (p = 0.01). However, in terms of LAS, with increased value of OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, the removal efficiency was increased and then with higher OLRs, removal efficiency was slightly decreased that is insignificant (p = 0.35) based on the statistical test ANOVA. The SEM images also showed that the biofilm formed on the media inside IFAS reactor plays a considerable role in adsorption and biodegradation of LAS, and oil & grease in greywater. The linear relation between inlet COD values and rate of removed LAS indicated that the ratio of inlet COD (mg/L) to removed LAS (mg/L) was 0.4. Therefore, use of IFAS system for biodegradation of LAS, oil and grease in greywater can be an applicable option."

This includes promoting sustainable intensification and diversification of production systems .,"[6] Climate change has an impact on the environment, especially in agriculture. Climate change which caused the emergence of extreme weather led to declining agricultural productivity or crop failures in several regions. Some areas of Gunungkidul are the most difficult areas to plant rice compared to other regencies/cities in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. The issue of agricultural land conversion is a problem for almost all countries in the world that are difficult to resolve as development increases. Different policies are implemented to minimize the adverse effects of the conversion of agricultural land in various regions of the world. One of the policies that applied in Indonesia is the policy of Sustainable Food Agriculture Land Protection or Perlindungan Lahan Pertanian Pangan Berkelanjutan (PLP2B policy). Until now, this policy was slowing the movement in Indonesia, including in Gunungkidul. This article aims to analyze the performance and dilemma of this policy in Gunungkidul. Qualitative research with case study approach had been done and data was collected through documentation or literature study, observation, in-depth interviews and Forum Group Discussion. The results showed that PLP2B policy has not been optimally implemented and still become a dilemma to local government rather than become a solution. [8] The capacity of the Government of Indonesia to grow the country to be developed country in 2025 as mentioned in The Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's Economic Development (abbreviated MP3EI) faces many challenges, one of them is financial capacity. Huge archipelago like Indonesia needs to be connected by good infrastructure, especially airport, and it's needed a big amount of money that the government still can afford it. The government realizes the limitation in funding the infrastructure needs. The government comes with the concept to form the cooperation with private sectors as known as a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The national planning agency in Indonesia for PPP planning and implementation issues the PPP book to provide potential investors the information on available infrastructure investment in Indonesia. Project listed in PPP Book are results of rigorous review and screening process by national planning agency. The projects are organized into potential projects, prospective projects, and ready to offer projects. The airport projects obtain the potential income from international flights and the forecast of passengers becomes the main factor in increasing the development of infrastructure. The PPP schemes is expected to fulfill the financial problems in infrastructure service providing. However, the private participation is expected not only to fill the funding but also to share experience and knowledge in the development, operation, and management of qualified infrastructure service. Therefore, the aim of the study is to develop risk mitigation strategy for airport infrastructure development projects and expected to be problem solving for the lack of succession of PPP and can be a solution for acceleration of infrastructure development in Indonesia. The research study was conducted by collecting data at several airports in Indonesia. The data used were primary and secondary data. The primary based upon field survey, while secondary according to the study on the various literatures of the success with the implementation of PPP in Indonesia and abroad. The findings and recommendations for the study are risk response and risk strategy in order to address of each risk that already identified. Risk response can be: Retention, Avoidance, Reduction, or Transfer. [14] The corrugated board industry in Indonesia is expecting another economic success fueled by increased consumer spending on factory produced processed foods and improved political stability and economic outlook. Other major factors that boost investment in box production are the five new board plants that have been commissioned during the past 18 months, and some existing factories that have installed new equipment in meeting expanding demand."
i_4,"Key Components of the Framework: Explainability and Interpretability: A formal framework for interpretable machine learning can be adapted, where an iterative procedure of questions and answers helps establish optimal trade-offs between explanatory accuracy, simplicity, and relevance .","[1] Automatic decision-making approaches, such as reinforcement learning (RL), have been applied to (partially) solve the resource allocation problem adaptively in the cloudcomputing system. However, a complete cloud resource allocation framework exhibits high dimensions in state and action spaces, which prohibit the usefulness of traditional RL techniques. In addition, high power consumption has become one of the critical concerns in design and control of cloud computing systems, which degrades system reliability and increases cooling cost. An effective dynamic power management (DPM) policy should minimize power consumption while maintaining performance degradationwithin an acceptable level. Thus, a joint virtual machine (VM) resource allocation and power management framework is critical to the overall cloud computing system. Moreover, novel solution framework is necessary to address the even higher dimensions in state and action spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework forsolving the overall resource allocation and power management problem in cloud computing systems. The proposed hierarchical framework comprises a global tier for VM resource allocation to the servers and a local tier for distributed power management of local servers. The emerging deep reinforcement learning (DRL) technique, which can deal with complicated control problems with large state space, is adopted to solve the global tier problem. Furthermore, an autoencoder and a novel weight sharing structure are adopted to handle the high-dimensional state space and accelerate the convergence speed. On the other hand, the local tier of distributed server power managements comprises an LSTM based workload predictor and a model-free RL based power manager, operating in a distributed manner. Experiment results using actual Google cluster traces showthat our proposed hierarchical framework significantly savesthe power consumption and energy usage than the baselinewhile achieving no severe latency degradation. Meanwhile, the proposed framework can achieve the best trade-off between latency and power/energy consumption in a server cluster. [9] In this paper, we address the problem of computing interpretable solutions to reinforcement learning (RL) problems. To this end, we propose a search algorithm over a space of simple closed-form formulas that are used to rank actions. We formalize the search for a high-performance policy as a multi-armed bandit problem where each arm corresponds to a candidate policy canonically represented by its shortest formula-based representation. Experiments, conducted on standard benchmarks, show that this approach manages to determine both efficient and interpretable solutions. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. [10] Symbolic planning models allow decision-making agents to sequence actions in arbitrary ways to achieve a variety of goals in dynamic domains. However, they are typically handcrafted and tend to require precise formulations that are not robust to human error. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches do not require such models, and instead learn domain dynamics by exploring the environment and collecting rewards. However, RL approaches tend to require millions of episodes of experience and often learn policies that are not easily transferable to other tasks. In this paper, we address one aspect of the open problem of integrating these approaches: how can decision-making agents resolve discrepancies in their symbolic planning models while attempting to accomplish goals? We propose an integrated framework named SPOTTER that uses RL to augment and support (""spot"") a planning agent by discovering new operators needed by the agent to accomplish goals that are initially unreachable for the agent. SPOTTER outperforms pure-RL approaches while also discovering transferable symbolic knowledge and does not require supervision, successful plan traces or any a priori knowledge about the missing planning operator."
i_1846,"Challenges and Implementation: Technological: Developing and adopting new technologies for recycling and waste management, such as blockchain for improving CE performance .","The recent circular economy movement has raised awareness and interest about untapped environmental and economic potential in the manufacturing industry. One of the crucial aspects in the implementation of circular or closed-loop manufacturing approach is the design of circular products. While it is obvious that three post-use strategies, i.e., reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, are highly relevant to achieve loop closure, it is enormously challenging to choose ""the right"" strategy (if at all) during the early design stage and especially at the single component level. One reason is that economic and environmental impacts of adapting these strategies are not explicit as they vary depending on the chosen business model and associated supply chains. In this scenario, decision support is essential to motivate adaptation of regenerative design strategies. The main purpose of this paper is to provide reliable decision support at the intersection of multiple lifecycle design and business models in the circular economy context to identify effects on cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The development of this work consists of a systematic method to quantify design effort for different circular design options through a multi-method simulation approach. The simulation model combines an agent-based product architecture and a discrete event closed-loop supply chain model. Feasibility of the model is tested using a case of a washing machine provided by Gorenje d.d. Firstly, design efforts for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling are quantified. Secondly, cost and emissions of different design options are explored with different business model configurations. Finally, an optimization experiment is run to identify the most cost-effective combination of reused, remanufactured, and recycled components for a business model chosen on the basis of the explorative study results.
[11]: The circular economy (CE) is an emergent concept to rethink and redesign how our economy works. The concept recognizes effective and efficient economic functioning at multiple scales-governments and individuals, globally and locally; for businesses, large and small. CE represents a systemic shift that builds long-term resilience at multiple levels (macro, meso and micro); generating new business and economic opportunities while providing environmental and societal benefits. Blockchain, an emergent and critical technology, is introduced to the circular economy environment as a potential enabler for many circular economic principles. Blockchain technology supported information systems can improve circular economy performance at multiple levels. Product deletion, a neglected but critical effort in product management and product portfolio management, is utilized as an illustrative business scenario as to blockchain's application in a circular economy research context. Product deletion, unlike product proliferation, has received minimal attention from both academics and practitioners. Product deletion decisions need to be evaluated and analyzed in the circular economy context. CE helps address risk aversion issues in product deletions such as inventory, waste and information management. This paper is the first to conceptualize the relationships amongst blockchain technology, product deletion and the circular economy. Many nuances of relationships are introduced in this study. Future evaluation and critical reflections are also presented with a need for a rigorous and robust research agenda to evaluate the multiple and complex relationships and interplay amongst technology, policy, commerce and the natural environment."
s_1524,"Tannin Levels: Tannin Content in Barley: Tannins are another group of anti-nutritional compounds found in grains. While specific data on tannin levels in pearl barley flour is not provided, it is known that tannins are generally concentrated in the outer layers of grains. Therefore, the pearling process, which removes these outer layers, would likely reduce the tannin content in pearl barley flour .","Purpose: Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is a rich source of nutrients as compared to the major cultivated cereal crops. However, major factors which limit its utilization are the presence of anti-nutritional factors (phytate, tannins and polyphenols) which lower availability of minerals and poor keeping quality because of higher lipase activity. Therefore, this paper aims to focus on the impact of different processing methods on the nutrient composition and anti-nutritional components of pearl millet. Design/methodology/approach: This is a literature review study from 1983 to 2017, focusing on studies related to pearl millet processing and their effectiveness in the enrichment of nutritional value through reduction of anti-nutritional compounds. Findings: From the literature reviewed, pearl millet processing through various methods including milling, malting, fermentation, blanching and acid as well as heat treatments were found to be effective in achieving the higher mineral digestibility, retardation of off flavor, bitterness as well as rancidity problems found during storage of flour. Originality/value: Through this review paper, possible processing methods and their impact on the nutrient and anti-nutrient profile of pearl millet are discussed after detailed studied of literature from journal articles and thesis.
[5]: Pearled barley kernels are usually cooked with rice in Japan. Their discoloration during and after cooking is one of the problems to promote barley consumption as a staple food. When cooked barley kernels were incubated, their a* values increased with time, which was influenced by water content of kernels. To evaluate a browning of cooked barley kernels, pearled barley kernels (10 varieties and 6 lines) were heated in mineral water at 105°C for 1 hour and further incubated at 70°C for 24 hours in a test tube. The a* value of the flour was measured after lyophilized and pulverized, and the increase in a* value during incubation after cooking (Δa*) was used as an indicator of the browning. The contents of flavanols in barley kernels decreased during incubation after cooking, as the Δa* increased. Prodelphinidin B3 decreased faster than procyanidin B3 and (+)-catechin. Varieties with high flavanol content in pearled kernels showed high ftavanol content in cooked kernels (r=0.986) and large flavanol loss during incubation after cooking (r= 0.921), when flavanol contents were determined by p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) method. The browning of cooked kernels was significantly correlated with the flavanol content in pearled kernels (r= 0.716) as well as the flavanol loss during incubation after cooking (r=0.838). The browning of cooked kernels was slightly observed in proanthocyanidin-free lines. These results indicate that flavanols are the major factor to cause the browning of cooked barley kernels."

It is also believed that advancements in search algorithms, such as those inspired by natural processes, could lead to even more efficient searching techniques in the future .","Search is considered to be an important functionality in a computational system. Search techniques are applied in file retrievals and indexing. Though there exists various search techniques, binary search is widely used in many applications due to its advantage over other search techniques namely linear and hash search. Binary search is easy to implement and is used to search for an element in a large search space. The worst case time complexity of binary search is O (log<inf>2</inf> n) where n is the number of elements (search space) in the array. However, in binary search, searching is performed on the entire search space. The complexity of binary search may be further reduced if the search space is reduced. This paper proposes an Ant Colony Optimization based Binary Search (ACOBS) algorithm to find an optimal search space for binary search. ACOBS algorithm categorizes the search space and the key element is searched only in a specific category where the key element can exist thereby reducing the search space. The time complexity of ACOBS algorithm is O (log<inf>2</inf> c) where c is the number of elements in the reduced search space and c &lt; n. The proposal is best suited for real time applications where searching is performed on a large domain."

A secondary purpose is to bring the library perspective on AI to the forefront of the scholarly world. This is a self-exploratory study, in which a qualitative approach interview has been conducted with 10 chief librarians/library heads (5 public + 5 private sectors) from universities regarding their views on the adoption of artificial intelligence tools in Pakistani academic libraries. Results are tabulated in a descriptive format. Librarians are aware of AI technologies. Services based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used in libraries, e.g. Google Assistant, Voice Searching, and Google Translate. Pattern recognition methods, such as text data mining, are also used to retrieve library material and conduct online searching. Big data is accessed via services such as cloud computing, OneDrive, and Google Drive. There is a very low level of awareness of robotics and chatbots. This study provides librarians with suggestions as to how AI tools could be used in libraries which either have yet to adopt AI technologies or wish to implement more advanced tools. Pakistani library schools could collaborate with computer science departments to establish AI Labs in the respective library and information science (LIS) departments/libraries. AI challenges funding and technological skills are the key problem to implement with AI in the University Libraries.
[5]: Current language processing technologies allow the creation of conversational chatbot platforms. Even though artificial intelligence is still too immature to support satisfactory user experience in many mass market domains, conversational interfaces have found their way into ad hoc applications such as call centres and online shopping assistants. However, they have not been applied so far to social inclusion of elderly people, who are particularly vulnerable to the digital divide. Many of them relieve their loneliness with traditional media such as TV and radio, which are known to create a feeling of companionship. In this paper we present the EBER chatbot, designed to reduce the digital gap for the elderly. EBER reads news in the background and adapts its responses to the user's mood. Its novelty lies in the concept of 'intelligent radio', according to which, instead of simplifying a digital information system to make it accessible to the elderly, a traditional channel they find familiar -background news- is augmented with interactions via voice dialogues. We make it possible by combining Artificial Intelligence Modelling Language, automatic Natural Language Generation and Sentiment Analysis. The system allows accessing digital content of interest by combining words extracted from user answers to chatbot questions with keywords extracted from the news items. This approach permits defining metrics of the abstraction capabilities of the users depending on a spatial representation of the word space. To prove the suitability of the proposed solution we present results of real experiments conducted with elderly people that provided valuable insights. Our approach was considered satisfactory during the tests and improved the information search capabilities of the participants."

s_480,"Social Sustainability: Human-Centered Design: ML is not effectively used to promote social sustainability, as it often neglects workplace ergonomics and worker well-being. In fact, IoT technology combined with ML can lead to manufacturing processes that are less human-centered, diminishing health, satisfaction, and performance .","One of the most actual and consistent drivers for the industry is sustainability, which includes three main pillars: environment, economics, and society. While numerous methods for environmental and economic sustainability assessment have been proposed, social sustainability assessment is still lacking in structured methods and tools, although human has always played a key role. Moreover, technological development is pushing the industrial world toward a new paradigm, the ""Industry 4.0,"" which embeds topics such as data digitalization, cyber-physical systems, and machine learning.

i_481,"Key Principles: User-Centric Ranking: Develop ranking algorithms that consider various factors such as text statistics, popularity, freshness, locality, content properties, and user background, which are the only factors necessary to tailor the search results to user preferences, ignoring other potential influences .","For an information retrieval system to be successful, it must have the ability to rank search results. As web search engines are the most often used and - in terms of ranking functionality - the most advanced existing systems, the principles they are based on and the strategies they use can be advantageous when applied to the library context. We categorize ranking factors into six different groups: 1. text statistics, 2. popularity, 3. freshness, 4. locality and availability, 5. content properties and 6. user background. We discuss the basic concepts and assumptions these ranking factors involve and offer potential implementations in the library context. The practice recommended here is for libraries to not only apply selected ranking factors - as existing library information systems already do - but to systematically test for the ranking factors best suited to their systems. We argue for a user-centric view on ranking, because in the end, ranking should be for the benefit of the user, and user preferences may vary across different contexts.
[9]: Canonical Information Retrieval systems perform a ranked keyword search strategy: Given a user's one-off information need (query), a list of documents, ordered by relevance, is returned. The main limitation of that ""one fits all"" approach is that long-term user interests are neglected in the search process, implicitly assuming that they are completely independent of the user query. Actually, there are information access scenarios that cannot be solved through a straightforward matching of queries and documents, since other elements influence the relevance of the retrieved results. In these scenarios, a smart search engine could exploit information about topics of interest, stored in the user profile, to automatically tailor ranking functions to a particular user. The main contribution of this paper is an extension of the vector space retrieval model in which user profiles learned by a content-based recommender system are taken into account to modify the ranking of search results. Experimental results in a movie retrieval scenario show how promising is the approach. Copyright © 2008, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence."

Patients were instructed to consume a low-sodium (50 mmol/d), high-potassium (supplementation with 30 to 60 mmol/d), and high-calcium (1000 mg/d) diet. Compliance with the diet was assessed at baseline and then 1, 2, and 3 mo after starting the diet. Sodium, potassium, and calcium intakes were carefully estimated from patients' dietary recall and 24-h urinary collection. Results: Estimated sodium intake significantly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.43 P < 0.001). However, estimated sodium intake was lower than urinary sodium excretion by 34% at baseline and by 47% after 3 mo of dieting (P < 0.05). Estimated potassium intake correlated with 24-h urinary excretion. Estimated calcium intake significantly increased from 933 ± 83 mg/d to 1029 ± 171 mg/d (P < 0.05). Calcium intake derived from patients' recall far exceeded and only slightly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.23, P < 0.01). Conclusions: Patients tend to underestimate their sodium intake by 30% to 50%; therefore, urinary sodium excretion is more accurate to assess sodium intake. Thus, 24-h urinary sodium excretion should be used in clinical practice and in clinical trials, especially when dietary non-compliance is suspected. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
s_170,"IT Security: Increasing Cybersecurity Threats: The growing sophistication of cybercriminals and the expanding IT 'attack surface' due to interconnected devices and systems necessitate robust cybersecurity measures. Organizations are recognizing the need for holistic and proactive cybersecurity approaches beyond traditional access control and perimeter defenses. Furthermore, it is likely that organizations that adopt advanced AI-driven cybersecurity solutions will experience a significant reduction in breach incidents, although this remains to be fully substantiated .","The pace of digital transformation and new technology development and the growing sophistication of cyber criminals result in organisations facing greater scope and severity of cybersecurity attacks on a daily basis-estimated to cost between $375 and $575 billion per annum. It is anticipated that as more devices, systems, and infrastructure become interconnected and interdependent, and as more interfaces between customers, suppliers, and partners are leveraged, the IT 'attack surface' will continue to expand. Organisations vary in their approaches to attempting to prevent cybersecurity breaches: some are overly restrictive, making even routine business activities difficult, while others are too relaxed with poor oversight and inadequate protocols and procedures, creating unnecessary exposures. However, applying appropriate cybersecurity controls is now a particular necessity where digital leaders often have a higher tolerance and appetite for risk-taking and experimentation to identify key opportunities for the future. Organisations now need to rethink their cybersecurity management approaches, and recognise that traditional access control and perimeter defences alone are no longer sufficient. Rather holistic and proactive approaches that continually evolve and adapt to counter emerging threats and minimise the potential negative consequences of exposure are required. Understanding how effective the organisation is in its cybersecurity efforts is a prerequisite for ensuring controls remain abreast with, and appropriate for, the changing IT threat landscape. This paper presents a cybersecurity conceptual framework that can be used by organisations to provide a holistic analysis of their cybersecurity approaches. It details the key factors or management themes underpinning cybersecurity effectiveness and how the insights gained through assessing performance against these factors or management themes can be practically used to improve cybersecurity effectiveness."
i_1082,"Neurological and Respiratory Symptoms: Neurological symptoms and respiratory issues can also occur, though they are less common .","Background: Yoga is a representative mind-body therapy of complementary and alternative medicine. In Japan, yoga is practiced widely to promote health, but yoga-associated adverse events have also been reported. To date, the frequencies and characteristics of yoga-related adverse events have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the frequencies and characteristics of adverse events of yoga performed in classes and the risk factors of such events. Methods: The subjects were 2508 people taking yoga classes and 271 yoga therapists conducting the classes. A survey for yoga class attendees was performed on adverse events that occurred during a yoga class on the survey day. A survey for yoga therapists was performed on adverse events that the therapists had observed in their students to date. Adverse events were defined as undesirable symptoms or responses that occurred during a yoga class. Results: Among 2508 yoga class attendees, 1343 (53.5%) had chronic diseases and 1063 (42.3%) were receiving medication at hospitals. There were 687 class attendees (27.8%) who reported some type of undesirable symptoms after taking a yoga class. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia were the most common symptoms, involving 297 cases, followed by neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms. Most adverse events (63.8%) were mild and did not interfere with class participation. The risk factors for adverse events were examined, and the odds ratios for adverse events were significantly higher in attendees with chronic disease, poor physical condition on the survey day, or a feeling that the class was physically and mentally stressful. In particular, the occurrence of severe adverse events that interfered with subsequent yoga practice was high among elderly participants (70 years or older) and those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: The results of this large-scale survey demonstrated that approximately 30% of yoga class attendees had experienced some type of adverse event. Although the majority had mild symptoms, the survey results indicated that attendees with chronic diseases were more likely to experience adverse events associated with their disease. Therefore, special attention is necessary when yoga is introduced to patients with stress-related, chronic diseases."
i_1456,"Expenditure Control: Efforts to control expenditures and utilization have historically failed, particularly within Medicaid, due to the autonomy and discretion of healthcare providers .","Five years and two near-death experiences later, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) has restructured the delivery of American health care. It has provided coverage to millions of Americans who previously lacked it, outlawed discrimination in the insurance marketplace, and armed patients with consumer-based tools to streamline their care. The ACA has had a positive impact throughout the country. But it can only go so far. Separate from providing access, the most daunting challenge facing American health care, and Medicare in particular, is how to control expenditures and utilization in an era of unprecedented enrollment growth. Past efforts to control expenditure and utilization have failed, and starkly conflict with the dominant paradigm in American health care that sanctifies the autonomy and nearly unlimited discretion of the American health care provider. This paradigm often views attempts that seek cost-effectiveness as heavyhanded government intervention. But as Medicare's enrollment is likely to swell from 52 million today to nearly 90 million by 2040, the costs and utilization problem will not abate with age. While the AC A may help reduce unnecessary and unwanted care and expand coverage, it cannot fully address the overtreatment problem due to a confluence of factors-namely, the often-acute emergent situations and incomparable pain patients encounter, the imperfect agency relationship between patients and payers, and the intractable information asymmetry that exists within the enterprise. This challenge begs for creative legal and policy-based solutions that seek to maintain provider autonomy and patients' freedom of choice, but also construct reasonable incentives and limitations to prod providers and Medicare beneficiaries into choosing more cost-effective treatments. It is made all the more difficult by Medicare's reimbursement structure, a regime that still largely rewards and incentivizes excess. Recognizing that tension, this piece nods to previous scholarship that has suggested importing fiduciary principles into the provider-patient relationship, but builds on it by arguing for the inculcation of fiduciary principles into the largely unrecognized payer-provider relationship. Requiring the provider to owe a duty of loyalty to the payers in the Medicare enterprise-American taxpayers-would introduce pressures on providers to limit excessive and expensive health care by opening the door for Medicare to seek judicial remedies in cases of wrongdoing. This new duty would further nuance the provider's loyalties and also reflect other professionals' multilayered duties of loyalty. Finally, this move would not increase regulations governing providers, nor rob them of their dear autonomy, but would limit unreasonable health care costs and utilization where possible-something that, heretofore, Medicare has failed to do."
i_1840,Key Principles of Circular Economy: Waste Generation: Increasing waste through excessive consumption and disposal practices .,"Reuse and recirculation of products and materials are the basis of the concept of the circular economy (CE). The CE is an innovative proposal that can result in positive impacts such as reduced demand for raw materials, reduced consumption of basic resources, and job creation, as well as preventing negative impacts resulting from the exploitation and processing of natural resources. Mining is infamous for its potential environmental impact, but mining waste from traditional mining (in the linear economy) may recover material through upcycling techniques, as can urban mining of industrial and post-consumer waste categories (in the circular economy). Urban mining, a form of closed-loop supply chain management, offers an attractive alternative to the management of waste electrical and electronic equipment (e-waste) and, at the same time, as a sustainable way to exploit mineral resources, reduces primary material intake and stimulates the circularity in the supply chain. The present study reviews the main CE solutions for e-waste management, highlighting the importance of recovering and classifying mineral material according to urban mining procedures.
[6]: The recent circular economy movement has raised awareness and interest about untapped environmental and economic potential in the manufacturing industry. One of the crucial aspects in the implementation of circular or closed-loop manufacturing approach is the design of circular products. While it is obvious that three post-use strategies, i.e., reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling, are highly relevant to achieve loop closure, it is enormously challenging to choose ""the right"" strategy (if at all) during the early design stage and especially at the single component level. One reason is that economic and environmental impacts of adapting these strategies are not explicit as they vary depending on the chosen business model and associated supply chains. In this scenario, decision support is essential to motivate adaptation of regenerative design strategies. The main purpose of this paper is to provide reliable decision support at the intersection of multiple lifecycle design and business models in the circular economy context to identify effects on cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emissions. The development of this work consists of a systematic method to quantify design effort for different circular design options through a multi-method simulation approach. The simulation model combines an agent-based product architecture and a discrete event closed-loop supply chain model. Feasibility of the model is tested using a case of a washing machine provided by Gorenje d.d. Firstly, design efforts for reuse, remanufacturing, and recycling are quantified. Secondly, cost and emissions of different design options are explored with different business model configurations. Finally, an optimization experiment is run to identify the most cost-effective combination of reused, remanufactured, and recycled components for a business model chosen on the basis of the explorative study results.
[7]: A circular economy (CE)-inspired waste management hierarchy was proposed for end-of-life (EOL) lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) from electric vehicles (EVs). Life cycle eco-efficiency metrics were then applied to evaluate potential environmental and economic trade-offs that may result from managing 1,000 end-of-life EV battery packs in the United States according to this CE hierarchy. Results indicate that if technology and markets support reuse of LIBs in used EVs, the net benefit would be 200,000 megajoules of recouped cumulative energy demand, which is equivalent to avoiding the production of 11 new EV battery packs (18 kilowatt-hours each). However, these benefits are magnified almost tenfold when retired EV LIBs are cascaded in a second use for stationary energy storage, thereby replacing the need to produce and use less-efficient lead-acid batteries. Reuse and cascaded use can also provide EV owners and the utility sector with cost savings, although the magnitude of future economic benefits is uncertain, given that future prices of battery systems are still unknown. In spite of these benefits, waste policies do not currently emphasize CE strategies like reuse and cascaded use for batteries. Though loop-closing LIB recycling provides valuable metal recovery, it can prove nonprofitable if high recycling costs persist. Although much attention has been placed on landfill disposal bans for batteries, results actually indicate that direct and cascaded reuse, followed by recycling, can together reduce eco-toxicity burdens to a much greater degree than landfill bans alone. Findings underscore the importance of life cycle and eco-efficiency analysis to understand at what point in a CE hierarchy the greatest environmental benefits are accrued and identify policies and mechanisms to increase feasibility of the proposed system."

It uses algorithms to transform free flow text (unstructured) into data that can be analyzed (structured) by applying Statistical, Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Text mining is an evolving technology that allows enterprises to understand their customers well, and help them in redefining customer needs. As e-commerce is becoming more and more established, the number of customer reviews and feedback that a product receives has grown rapidly over a period of time. For a popular asset, the number of review comments can be in thousands or even more. This makes it difficult for the manufacturer to read all of them to make an informed decision in improving product quality and support. Again it is difficult for the manufacturer to keep track and to manage all customer opinions. This article attempts to derive some meaningful information from asset reviews which will be used in enhancing asset features from engineering point of view and helps in improving the support quality and customer experience.

Extracting tuples from HTML pages has been an important issue in various web applications such as web data integration, e-commerce market monitoring, and mash ups that repurpose and selectively combine existing web data services. Data Mining is the process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information. Text Mining uses many applications of Data Mining. Text Mining is the discovery of unknown information by automatically extracting and relating the information from different resources. Text is classified based on the content that is used for mining. It is done based on comparing the text documents with the database. In the existing system, techniques like named entity recognition, information retrieval, information extraction and knowledge discovery are used for text mining. Google used page rank method to retrieve and rank the documents. However, Google rank may not provide the documents with the most relevant information. In the proposed system, information retrieval is used to collect many web documents and pre-processing the web documents and extract the text data.

This review discusses analytical methods for determination of sugars and sweetness of fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, including the use of destructive and non-destructive instrumental techniques to evaluate sugar composition and characterize taste profile or sweetness. From the standard hand-held refractometer to the hydrometer, electronic tongue and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with different detectors, a wide range of devices have been used to determine sugar composition and sweetness of many fruit and vegetable products. Although chromatographic techniques are very accurate and useful, they require extensive sample preparation based on solvent extraction and hence are generally time-consuming and expensive. Visible to near infrared spectroscopy (vis/NIRS) has been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional methods due to its rapidity, simplicity, cost effectiveness and potential for routine analysis if proper calibration and validation steps were developed. Current trends favour analytical methods that are simple to use, quick and non-destructive.

s_341,"Domain-Specific Applications: Tailor the KG for specific applications such as recommendation systems, semantic search, and question answering .","[12] Graph, as an important data representation, is ubiquitous in many real world applications ranging from social network analysis to biology. How to correctly and effectively learn and extract information from graph is essential for a large number of machine learning tasks. Graph embedding is a way to transform and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-euclidean feature space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural network, for learning tasks in graph-structured data with both node and edge features. CensNet is a general graph embedding framework, which embeds both nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original undirected graph, the role of nodes and edges are switched, and two novel graph convolution operations are proposed for feature propagation. Experimental results on real-world academic citation networks and quantum chemistry graphs show that our approach achieves or matches the state-of-the-art performance in four graph learning tasks, including semi-supervised node classification, multi-task graph classification, graph regression, and link prediction.

Inspiration-oriented search is identified as a variant of the more widely-studied problem of serendipitous retrieval, and defined as an information-seeking behavior in which users consciously search for items that are related to known items in ways that are recognizable once seen, but that are nevertheless unpredictable at search-time. Various strategies for the maximization of both the recognisability and unpredictability of related items are then described, including user-interface and user-experience changes and the reconceptualization of datastores as knowledge graphs. Directions for further research are then outlined – including, most importantly, possible metrics for inspiration-oriented search and their potential for use in machine-learning ranking frameworks."

It is also involved in forming complexes with protein, making protein less soluble, and affecting enzymatic degradation, gastric absorption, and malting processes. The phytic acid and protein contents of barley grains are influenced by genetic and environmental factors. This study investigated differences in phytic acid and protein contents in grains of 100 barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes or cultivars. Eight barley cultivars were selected and grown at seven locations for two years to study the effects of genotypic and environmental factors on phytic acid content (PAC) and its relation to malt quality.

The effects of cultivars, locations, time and their interactions were highly significant, but the variation was mainly attributed to the environment (location and time). The correlation between grains phytic acid and protein content was significant and positive. Whereas, the correlation between grain phytic acid content and malt extract was significant and negative. The relationship between phytic acid and protein contents of barley is important as it affects the malting process, malt yield and quality, and final beer quality.

s_1149,"Emerging Therapies: Research is ongoing to develop alternative treatments, such as enzyme therapies and immune modulators, but these are not yet widely available .","Purpose of Review: Celiac disease is a common chronic autoimmune condition for which the only therapy currently available is strict adherence to a gluten-free diet for life. Although the diet is effective in reversing the intestinal mucosal changes, it is cumbersome to follow, is associated with some dietary deficiencies, is less palatable, and has significant quality of life implications. For all these reasons, alternatives to the gluten-free diet would greatly benefit people with celiac disease. Recent Findings: A better understanding of the pathophysiology of celiac disease has led to possible new treatments that target various steps in the development of the disease. These include intraluminal digestive enzymes and peptide-binding agents that render gluten non-toxic, drugs that modulate tight junctions between enterocytes or interfere with the inflammatory cascade that causes mucosal destruction, and agents designed to induce immune tolerance to gluten. Summary: Although several of these new therapeutic agents currently under investigation are showing some promise, they still need to demonstrate they are as effective and safe as the gluten-free diet before they can be recommended as an acceptable alternative for treatment of people with celiac disease. The gluten-free diet remains the only proven safe and effective treatment for celiac disease."
s_1926,"Comparison of Disturbance Patterns: Key Differences: Climate Change Influence: Boreal forests are more directly impacted by climate-induced changes in fire regimes, whereas temperate forests may experience increased frequency of ice storms and other intermediate disturbances .","Large-scale disturbances such as ice storms may increase in frequency and intensity as climate changes. While disturbances are a natural component of forest ecosystems, climatically driven alteration to historical patterns may impart fundamental change to ecosystem function. At Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, experimental ice storms of varying severity were applied to replicate plots of mature northern hardwoods to quantify their effects on forested ecosystems. We assessed ice storm treatment effects on insectivorous foliage-gleaning birds and evaluated insectivore predation on model caterpillars in the understory vegetation. These birds are charismatic, of conservation concern, and are major predators of caterpillars. In turn, lepidopterans are the dominant herbivores in temperate forests and are integral to ecosystem function. We predicted that avian abundance would increase due to additional structural heterogeneity caused by ice treatments, with a concomitant increase in caterpillar predation. Point counts were used to measure insectivorous bird activity in the ice storm experiment plots and additional control plots before and after treatments. We deployed and retrieved plasticine model caterpillars and estimated predation from characteristic marks to these surrogates. Abundance of foliage-gleaning birds was higher in the ice storm plots and birds responded to treatments as a single diffuse disturbance rather than on an individual plot level. All species except one were observed both before and after the ice treatments. Surprisingly, predation on caterpillar models was unaffected by ice storm treatments but rather was a function of caterpillar density. The increase in avian abundance in the ice storm treatment plots corroborates other studies of bird responses to relatively small-scale disturbances in forests and the limited change in species composition was expected given the plot size. We conclude that ice storms may provide beneficial changes for foliage-gleaning birds in the growing season following the disturbance.
[4]: Predicting the effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on forest aboveground biomass is a central task of studies in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The alteration of temperature, precipitation, and disturbance regimes induced by climate warming will affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. Boreal forest is an important forest type in China, the responses of which to climate warming and fire disturbance are increasingly obvious. In this study, we used a forest landscape model LANDIS PRO to simulate the effects of climate change on aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the Great Xing'an Mountains, and compared direct effects of climate warming and the effects of climate warming-induced fires on forest aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass in this area increased under climate warming scenarios and fire disturbance scenarios with increased intensity. Under the current climate and fire regime scenario, the aboveground biomass in this area was (97.14±5.78) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, and the value would increase up to (97.93±5.83) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> under the B1F2 scenario. Under the A2F3 scenario, aboveground biomass at landscape scale was relatively higher at the simulated periods of year 100-150 and year 150-200, and the value were (100.02±3.76) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> and (110.56±4.08) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, the predicted biomass at landscape scale was increased by (0.56±1.45) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>under the CF2 scenario (fire intensity increased by 30%) at some simulated periods, and the aboveground biomass was reduced by (7.39±1.79) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> in CF3 scenario (fire intensity increased by 230%) at the entire simulation period. There were significantly different responses between coniferous and broadleaved species under future climate warming scenarios, in that the simulated biomass for both Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla showed decreasing trend with climate change, whereas the simulated biomass for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, Picea koraiensis and Populus davidiana showed increasing trend at different degrees during the entire simulation period. There was a time lag for the direct effect of climate warming on biomass for coniferous and broadleaved species. The response time of coniferous species to climate warming was 25-30 years, which was longer than that for broadleaf species. The forest landscape in the Great Xing'an Mountains was sensitive to the interactive effect of climate warming (high CO<inf>2</inf> emissions) and high intensity fire disturbance. Future climate warming and high intensity forest fire disturbance would significantly change the composition and structure of forest ecosystem.
[6]: The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale. Results from our research provided insight into the future forest management and have implications for improving boreal forest sustainability."
i_1101,"Similarities with General Allergic Reactions: Management: The management of food allergies, like other allergies, is largely the same, suggesting that all allergic conditions can be treated with the same methods, including avoidance of the allergen, use of antihistamines, and emergency preparedness with epinephrine for severe reactions .","Purpose of review The present review serves to address food allergy, which is a common problem encountered by the general pediatrician. Between 4 and 6% of US children have an allergic reaction to at least one food, and the prevalence of some food allergies appears to be increasing. Recent findings A combination of genetic influences, characteristics of food antigen processing, and timing of food introduction may influence the development of food allergy. Avoidance of highly allergenic foods beyond 4-6 months may not be effective at preventing the development of food allergy in most children, and the effect of specific early introduction of allergenic foods is being investigated. Oral immunotherapy is under investigation but may be limited in future use by several factors, including a significant rate of allergic reactions. Summary Current management of food allergy focuses on accurate diagnosis, appropriate counseling regarding strict allergen avoidance with review of available educational resources, emergency preparedness, instruction on the use of self-injectable epinephrine, and ongoing surveillance for the possible development of tolerance. © 2009 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
[9]: Food allergies are a common condition seen in both adult and child population that are typically acute in onset, developing less than 2 h after the ingestion. More than 120 foods have been described as causing food allergies, but only a limited number of those are responsible for the majority of allergic reactions, affected by factors including age, preferences, and region. Basic researches were carried out using certified reference materials to determine relevant threshold for food allergens in order to help patients select food reasonably. Symptoms can involve any organ of the body; commonly involve cutaneous, oropharyngeal, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. These effects are believed to be due to the release of histamine by an immunological reaction which varies in clinical symptoms and extent of allergic reaction. Sporadic urticaria, congestion around the mouth, itching in the pharynx and larynx may present in mild patients. Serious urticaria, angioedema, vomiting, dyspnea, abdominal pain, diarrhea and/or even life-threatening anaphylaxis may appear in severe allergic patients. Cases of atopic dermatitis, eczema, eosinophilic esophagitis and asthma have been reported. Care of high risk population is desired. Some reports suggested that infants should delay the introduction of allergenic foods and mothers prolong avoidance of allergenic foods during pregnancy and lactation with family histories of allergy. Supplementation with early nutrition may play a role in preventing early childhood allergic disease in children at high risk of allergy. The gut microbiome, vitamins A, vitamins D, vitamins E, and zinc may affect the course of food allergy, but the evidences are weak. Currently there has been no available therapy as routine clinical care for food allergy patients. In addition to emergency treatment, chronic patients need oral anti-histamine drugs and other symptomatic treatment. Potentially effective treatments include Chinese herbal medicine and allergy immunotherapy targeting mucosal immune system. Studies have shown that some immunity enhancers that are involved in the regulation of the immune system may be risk factors for the development, severity and course of acute and long-term food allergy. The current standard of food allergy care remains counseling the patients to strictly avoid culprit food allergens, using antihistamines and an epinephrine in case of accidental exposure. Identification of known food allergens prior to consumption is by far the most effective and feasible approach to prevent allergic reactions. But for main food allergy, such as wheat and/or rice allergy, simple avoidance is difficult. We are carrying out an ongoing study on destroying food proteins that are responsible for allergy by different food processing techniques. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of allergic reactions while maintaining nutritional requirements for the patients, foods for special medical purposes (FSMP) are introduced to manage the diets of concerned population. Furthermore, a comprehensive nutrition assessment with appropriate intervention is mandatory in all children with food allergies to meet nutrient needs and optimize growth. The cooperation of dietary assessment, regular follow-up checks and professional guidance when necessary contributes to significantly improve life quality of patients who suffer from food allergy."
s_1855,"The presence of diverse microbial populations on plastic carriers can lead to efficient degradation of pollutants, but the long-term integrity of these carriers under anaerobic conditions remains a concern .","The moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBRs) were used to remove the residual NO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>-N of wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) effluent, and the MBBR carriers for denitrification were compared. The results showed that high denitrification efficiency can be achieved with polyethylene, polypropylene, polyurethane foam, and haydite carriers under following conditions: 7.2 to 8.0 pH, 24 to 26 °C temperature, 12 h hydraulic retention time (HRT), and 25.5 mg L<sup>−1</sup> external methanol dosage, while the WWTP effluent total nitrogen (TN) was between 2.6 and 15.4 mg L<sup>−1</sup> and NO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>-N was between 0.2 and 12.6 mg L<sup>−1</sup>. The MBBR filled with polyethylene carriers had higher TN and NO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>-N removal rate (44.9 ± 19.1 and 83.4 ± 13.0 %, respectively) than those with other carriers. The minimum effluent TN and NO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>-N of polyethylene MBBR were 1.6 and 0.1 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and the maximum denitrification rate reached 23.0 g m<sup>−2</sup> day<sup>−1</sup>. When chemical oxygen demand (COD)/TN ratio dropped from 6 to 4, the NO<inf>3</inf><sup>−</sup>- N and TN removal efficiency decreased significantly in all reactors except for that filled with polyethylene, which indicated that the polyethylene MBBR can resist influent fluctuation much better. The three-dimensional excitation–emission matrix analysis showed that all the influent and effluent of MBBRs contain soluble microbial products (SMPs)-like organics and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), which can be removed better by MBBRs filled with haydite and polyethylene carriers. The nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ)-based terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis suggested that the dominant bacteria in polyethylene MBBR are the key denitrificans.
[2]: Biofilm containing fix-bed systems are frequently applied for intensifying biological treatment in wastewater purification. In these operational units a lot of different biofilm carriers have been used and tested; among them, however, the polymer fiber-based materials are barely investigated. The authors studied four carriers: three types of polypropylene (PP) fibers and a polyester (PES) fiber were compared relating their physical-chemical characteristics and biofilm colonization properties. For the physical-chemical characterization surfactants release, wettability, methylene blue bromophenol blue and protein (bovine serum albumin) adsorption were measured as well as the surface charges of the biofilm carriers were determined by zeta potential examinations. Colonization experiments were carried out in a pilot plant scale biological municipal wastewater treatment system consisting of eight cascade reactors for 18 days. Each of the four tested fibers were placed into the reactors, and biofilm colonization was followed by measuring the dry biomass content and TTC (triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) enzyme activity of the biofilms adhered to the polymer fibers. During the colonization experiments pH, chemical oxygen demand (COD), concentration of total suspended solids (TSS), various nitrogenous compounds and dissolved oxygen were also monitored in the water phase of the reactors. Among the four different fibers one of the PP carriers turned to be the most favorable in colonization tests. This carrier, having surface and wetting properties differing from the other ones colonized the maximum biofilm mass, and the biofilm grown on this fiber had also the highest total enzyme activity all along the purification process, both in organic material degrading and in nitrifying reactors. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.
[3]: The impact of using different plastic mesh in rotating biofilm reactors (RBRs) on the treatment performance, biofilm activity and viability under varying organic loading rates (OLRs) was investigated. Laboratory-scale RBRs treating real wastewater were operated under OLR loading conditions typical of pre-treatment processes. A fully-crossed, three-factorial design series of experiments was undertaken with low and high surface area mesh made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polypropylene (PP) operated at low, medium, high and very high OLR. The maximum volumetric removal rate of 2.4 kg sCOD m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> occurred at the high OLR, for low surface area mesh, irrespective of plastic used. The highest OLR at which nitrification could be attained was 35 g sCOD m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>. The biofilm growth decreased under medium compared to low OLR on all mesh. This coincided with a ∼2 fold decrease in the microbial viability. Higher surface area mesh was important for high nitrification rates at medium OLR (p < 0.05). In contrast the low surface area PVC and PP mesh was best at very high OLR (160 g sCOD m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup> or ∼320 g BOD<inf>5</inf> m<sup>−2</sup> d<sup>−1</sup>) for bulk organics removal (p < 0.05). Therefore, lower surface area mesh is recommended for wastewater pre-treatments at high OLR, whilst high surface area mesh was best for elevated nitrification rates at medium OLR. The microbial activity and viability had a strong positive correlation with OLR (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, p < 0.001 and 0.81, p < 0.001 respectively). The microbial activity and viability also positively correlated (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.4, p < 0.05 and 0.29, p < 0.01 respectively) to the sCOD removal performance but not the ammonia removal in mesh RBRs. This confirms the importance of maintaining biofilm activity and viability for bulk organics removal in biofilm processes in wastewater treatment."
i_1891,"Ecological Balance: The structural attributes of old-growth forests, such as tree-size demographic equilibrium, contribute to their sustainability and resilience. These forests serve as benchmarks for managed forests, providing insights into maintaining ecological balance .","[11] While it is widely acknowledged that forest biodiversity contributes to climate change mitigation through improved carbon sequestration, conversely how climate affects tree species diversity–forest productivity relationships is still poorly understood. We combined the results of long-term experiments where forest mixtures and corresponding monocultures were compared on the same site to estimate the yield of mixed-species stands at a global scale, and its response to climatic factors. We found positive mixture effects on productivity using a meta-analysis of 126 case studies established at 60 sites spread across five continents. Overall, the productivity of mixed-species forests was 15% greater than the average of their component monocultures, and not statistically lower than the productivity of the best component monoculture. Productivity gains in mixed-species stands were not affected by tree age or stand species composition but significantly increased with local precipitation. The results should guide better use of tree species combinations in managed forests and suggest that increased drought severity under climate change might reduce the atmospheric carbon sequestration capacity of natural forests. [18] Deforestation often has been studied in terms of land-use models, in which natural processes such as ecological succession, physical disturbance and human decision-making are combined. In many land-use models, landowners are assumed to make decisions that maximize their utilities. However, since human understanding of ecological and social dynamics is clouded by uncertainty, landowners may not know true utility values, and may learn these values from their experiences. We develop a decision model for forest use under social learning to explore whether social learning is efficient to improve landowners' decisions and can lead to effective forest management. We assume that a forest is composed of a number of land parcels that are individually managed; landowners choose whether or not to cut trees by comparing the expected utilities of forest conservation and deforestation; landowners learn utility values not only from their own experiences, but also by exchanging and sharing information with others in a society. By analyzing the equilibrium and stability of the landscape dynamics, we observed four possible outcomes: a stationary-forested landscape, a stationary-deforested landscape, an unstable landscape fluctuating near an equilibrium, and a cyclic-forested landscape induced by synchronized deforestation. Synchronized deforestation, which resulted in a resource shortage in a society, was likely to occur when landowners employed a stochastic decision and a short-term memory about past experiences. Social welfare under a cyclic-forested landscape can be significantly lower than that of a stationary-forested landscape. This implies that learning and remembering past experiences are crucial to prevent overexploitation of forest resources and degradation of social welfare. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
s_402,"5. Constraint-Based Systems: Description: These systems use constraints to define the relationships between different variables. The system finds solutions that satisfy all constraints. Example: A constraint-based paradigm using the Gecode constraint system has been proposed for developing expert system shells, offering advantages in memory usage and knowledge representation .","Expert system is a computer program that is different from other conventional computer programs in that it incorporates specific knowledge, which can be human judgment, experience, and expertise, in order to provide knowledgeable advice to users. The main difference is caused from the structure of an expert system that contains the two loosely coupled parts: knowledge inference engine and knowledge base, instead of one tightly integrated structure. The loose coupling allows knowledge base contents to be dynamically added, removed, modified, or even completely changed to another subject area, whereas the inference engine remains intact and needs no modification. We refer to the knowledge inference engine as an expert system shell because it can be viewed as an outer layer program to infer knowledge advice from the inner knowledge base core. The development of expert system shell can be efficiently achieved through the support of logic-based language such as Prolog. In this paper, we propose and demonstrate a different scheme of expert system shell development using a constraint-based paradigm with the ECLiPSe constraint system. Comparisons of the two paradigms have been done in terms of computational time, memory usage, and lines of code. The experimental results reveal that the difference in lines of code of the two paradigms is insignificance, but the constraint-based paradigm uses less memory during execution and provides more concise form of knowledge representation."

The new radar system can detect targets as close as 6ft from the antenna on the shortest scale and can separate targets that are 30ft apart in range on the scales used for navigation. It also makes the system perfect to use for anti-collision and precision docking."
i_232,"Conclusion: Enhanced Scalability: Blockchain storage, when integrated with scalable data management methods and enhanced by AI, can significantly improve the scalability of PACS and AI systems. This integration can lead to more efficient, secure, and scalable solutions for managing large volumes of data in healthcare and other industries .","—Blockchain is an emerging technology that would possibly disrupt the existing centralized financial systems lead to the rise to a new technology era for the financial sector. Additionally, different new use cases such as healthcare, identity management, etc. suggest that Blockchain has much wider applications. Blockchain is founded on distributed ledger technology that ensures trust through consensus between parties in a peer-to-peer network instead of the need to a third party or central authority. However, blockchain has several limitations such as scalability, latency, low throughput which are the main barriers for Blockchain being adopted by the industries. Of all, scalability is the most critical limitation of blockchain that needs an efficient and effective solution. In this paper, we aim to enhance the scalability of blockchain by designing and implementing a massively scalable architecture for private blockchain-based applications, called ElasticBloC. To evaluate our contribution, we conducted several experiments on ElasticBloC. The results showed that ElasticBloC is a high-performant architecture that scales massively.
[5]: To solve the problems about the scalability of blockchain storage capacity, storage structure, etc, a structured data management method based on scalable blockchain storage was presented. Based on node dynamic net and the DHT protocol, only part of the data was needed to be stored in every peer to realize the data management. The data signature and timing verification were used to ensure the security of data management, and structured data was stored in the local database to extend the business data management. Test results show that, this method can achieve structured data management based on scalable blockchain storage, make the best of the network resources, reduce the storage pressure of each peer, improve the efficiency of data storage, and promote the development of block chain application in the foreseeable future.
[8]: This paper introduces the BlockStream model, a novel integration of blockchain technology into cloud storage systems aimed at addressing the core challenges of security, efficiency, and transparency. The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive system design and implementation, utilizing synthetic datasets for performance evaluation against traditional cloud storage solutions. Key findings reveal that the BlockStream model significantly enhances storage efficiency, with data deduplication rates and storage space utilization surpassing existing models by up to 15%. Moreover, it achieves a notable reduction in data retrieval times, improving by 7.14% over the most efficient traditional systems, and demonstrates superior security capabilities, particularly in resistance to DDoS attacks and unauthorized access prevention, markedly outperforming the baseline models. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize cloud storage paradigms, offering a scalable, secure, and user-centric data management solution. Quantitatively, the BlockStream model not only reduces average data retrieval times from 400ms to 320ms compared to current leading solutions but also elevates the security and robustness of cloud storage systems to levels previously unattained, marking a significant advancement in the field. These enhancements, underpinned by the decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature of blockchain, present a compelling case for the integration of blockchain technology in improving the architecture and operation of cloud storage systems."

For example, a pressure drop of 147.60 Pa was noted for a high-efficiency PLA/chitosan filter .","Particulate matter (PM) pollution, which usually carries viruses and bacteria, has drawn considerable attention as a major threat to public health. In this present study, an environment-friendly antibacterial Poly(lactic acid)(PLA)/chitosan composite air filter was fabricated using the one-step electrospinning technique. The composite PLA/chitosan fibres show a highly porous structure, in which chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) were found to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire fibre. The morphologies, through-pore size and distribution, air filtration and anti-microbial properties of these filter media were studied. The results showed that it was not the chitosan content but instead the concentration of the spinning solutions that had the greatest effect on the morphologies of the porous fibres. The relative humidity influenced the nanometre-scale pores on the surface of PLA/chitosan fibres. The PLA/chitosan fibrous membranes with a chitosan to PLA mass ratio of 2.5:8 exhibited a high filtration efficiency of 98.99% and a relatively low pressure drop (147.60 Pa) when the air flow rate was 14 cm/s, while these also had high antibacterial activity of 99.4% and 99.5% against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively.

i_2031,"Combining Morphological Traits and Microsatellite Markers: Genetic Diversity and Clustering: Studies have shown that combining morphological traits with SSR markers can effectively reveal genetic diversity and structure among melon accessions. For instance, in muskmelon, morphological traits under different water conditions and SSR markers were used to cluster accessions into distinct groups, indicating high genetic variability. Additionally, it is believed that the genetic diversity observed may also influence the adaptability of muskmelon accessions to varying climatic conditions, although this remains to be thoroughly investigated .","In the present study genetic diversity among 48 muskmelon accessions was analyzed employing various morphological traits under well-watered and water-deficit condition and SSR markers. Maximum values for horticultural traits were, 44 cm for fruit polar circumference, 33.2 cm for fruit equatorial circumference, 21 for number of fruits, 41.5 for days to first male flowering, 44 for days to 50% male flowering, 44 days to first female flowering, 45 days to 50% female flowering and 5.66 for number of shoot branching under well-watered condition. While under water-deficit condition maximum values of same parameters were 28.8 cm, 26 cm, 18, 37.2, 39, 47, 46.2 and 4.4, respectively. Based on morphological traits genotypes were clustered in three major clusters under well-watered condition, while grouped in five major clusters under water-deficit condition. Out of the 52 SSR markers, 35 produced polymorphic patterns, a total of 125 amplification products were obtained, the mean number of alleles per locus was 3.57, and the size of amplified products ranged from 120 bp to 605 bp. The average PIC value was estimated to be 0.492. Jaccard similarity coefficients calculated from SSR data varied from 0.03 to 0.89 with a mean value of 0.46. The clustering pattern of muskmelon accessions based on SSR markers was random but not in consonance with the groupings based on quantitative traits under well-watered and water-deficit condition. High genetic variability was observed based on various morphological traits, under both well-watered and water-deficit condition and SSR markers, indicating genetically diverse accessions."
s_1651,"Automation and Monitoring: Computer Vision Systems: Automation in phenotyping through computer vision systems has streamlined the process of measuring and selecting fish for breeding, reducing manual labor and increasing accuracy. This technology has shown a positive correlation with human measurements, making it a viable alternative for commercial fish farming .","[3] Throughout the Asia Pacific region, fish farming is a vital and growing source of food security and economic activity. Since 1970, aquaculture has maintained an average annual growth rate of 8.7% in the region. Currently, almost 90% of global aquaculture production currently takes place in Asia Pacific and over 20 million people are employed in the sector. This growth has been associated with a large increase in family-run backyard aquaculture and integrated agriculture-aquaculture reservoirs in areas like rural Vietnam. However, yields in those rural ponds have typically been low. This is largely due to lack of aeration systems, which introduce oxygen into the pond water and allow for greater stocking densities, healthier fish, and greater yields. Aeration systems typically are not employed in these remote communities due to high capital costs, lack of access to reliable electricity, and prohibitive maintenance costs. To address this need, a low-cost solar-thermal aeration system for implementation in resource-constrained settings was devised. The system consists of a metallic solar collector and a heat transfer column, which induces convective circulation in the water by dissipating heat to the cooler, deeper layers of the pond. As a result of the circulation produced by the device, oxygen generated by phytoplankton at the top of the pond is distributed throughout the water column, preventing oxygen losses to the atmosphere due to surface supersaturation and increasing the overall pond oxygen content. This paper presents the system models developed to validate the concept, including a Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model and a diel Dissolved Oxygen (DO) simulation model. These models, when used in conjunction, can estimate the increase in DO to be expected by the introduction of passive aeration device. These models were tailored to represent two target test ponds in Bac Ninh, Vietnam. To calibrate the models, instrumentation measured relevant parameters including DO and water temperatures at various depths, wind speed, ambient air temperature, and solar irradiance. A description of the mechanical design, construction and installation of two full-scale prototypes is then discussed, and field results for the first month post-implementation are analyzed. The model and experimental results indicate that the device can improve the DO content at deep levels of the ponds (i.e. oxygen-depleted regions) and has the potential to improve aquaculture productivity in resource-constrained settings."
i_282,"OpenPose is known for its high accuracy in detecting keypoints and handling occlusions effectively. It uses a part affinity field approach to detect and associate body parts, which helps in maintaining accuracy even in complex environments  .","This paper proposes a real-time human pose recognition method based on bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM). OpenPose is utilized as the human pose estimation module to obtain two-dimensional joint point data of the human body. According to the condition of missing data, it can judge whether the human body is in the occlusion state. For non-occlusion cases, a classifier is formulated by the bidirectional LSTM, and the initial two-dimensional joint point information is sent to the classifier for human pose recognition. For the occlusion state, the depth camera internal parameters are used for 3D mapping. The torso vector and joint angle are constructed. The aforementioned high-dimension features are processed using principal component analysis and sent to the classifier for human pose recognition. The KTH dataset and a laboratory dataset containing five human poses are utilized to evaluate the proposed method. Under non-occlusion conditions, experimental results show that the accuracy values of the proposed algorithm are 2.63% and 1.08% higher than those of traditional models and deep learning models. Under occlusion conditions, the accuracy rate is improved by 5.6% compared to the traditional model. Human pose recognition in complex environments is achieved.
[2]: In this paper, we propose a novel human body pose refinement method that relies on an existing single-frame pose detector and uses an optical flow algorithm in order to increase quality of output trajectories. First, a pose estimation algorithm such as OpenPose is applied and the error of keypoint position measurement is calculated. Then, the velocity of each keypoint in frame coordinate space is estimated by an optical flow algorithm, and results are merged through a Kalman filter. The resulting trajectories for a set of experimental videos were calculated and evaluated by metrics, which showed a positive impact of optical flow velocity estimations. Our algorithm may be used as a preliminary step to further joint trajectory processing, such as action recognition."
i_1298,"** Barriers and Facilitators: ** Nurse Involvement: The adherence of nurses to smoking cessation interventions is crucial. Factors such as consistent use of intervention tools, perceived advantages, and involvement in decision-making significantly influence adherence and effectiveness .","[2] Debate exists about how intense smoking cessation interventions for hospitalized patients should be. In this study we assessed the effectiveness of a low-intensity smoking cessation intervention for hospitalized patients, without follow-up phone calls. We designed a cohort study with a historical control group, in the Department of Medicine of an 850-bed teaching hospital. One hundred and seventeen consecutive eligible smokers received the intervention, and 113 smokers hospitalized before the implementation of the intervention constituted the historical control group. The 30-min smoking cessation intervention was performed by a trained resident without any follow-up contact. Counseling was matched to smokers' motivation to quit, and accompanied by a self-help booklet. Nicotine replacement therapy was prescribed when indicated. All patients received a questionnaire to evaluate their smoking habits 6 months after they left hospital. We counted patients lost to follow-up as continuous smokers and smoking abstinence was validated by patients' physicians. Validated smoking cessation rates were 23.9% in the intervention group and 9.7% in the control group (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.4-6.2). After adjusting for potential confounders, intervention was still effective with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.26 (95% confidence interval: 1.04-4.95). Among those who continued to smoke 6 months after hospitalization, the likelihood of reporting any decrease of cigarette consumption was higher in the intervention cohort (70.8 vs. 42.7%, P=0.001). A low-intensity smoking cessation intervention, based on two visits without any follow-up contact, is associated with a higher quit rate at 6 months than that for historical control patients. Our findings show that a low-intensity smoking cessation intervention, based on two visits without any follow-up contact, is associated with a higher quit rate at 6 months than that for historical control patients. © 2006 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins. [5] Background: Smoking cessation is the most useful and cost effective way to reduce the risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and stop its progression. Long-term success rates with smoking cessation programs are known to be poor. Aim: To identify factors influencing the outcomes of smoking cessation programs in COPD patients from their perspective. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 patients with a history of smoking, chosen from a cohort of 173 patients with moderate to severe COPD participating in a community-based randomised trial. Results: The study sample consisted of 6 females and 21 males with a mean age of 69.6 years and a mean smoking history of 58.5 ± 34.1 pack years. 6 patients continued to smoke at the time of the interview. Patients had attempted both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for quitting. Smoking cessation in COPD patients was influenced by various barriers and facilitators pertaining to patient, health, treatment and healthcare providers. Conclusion: Health professionals may be able to improve the outcomes of smoking cessation programs in COPD patients by being more proactive in offering combination smoking cessation interventions with adequate follow-up. [12] Background: Despite proven benefits through the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and reduction of mortality, cardiac rehabilitation (CR) remains underutilized in cardiac patients. Underserved populations most affected by CVD including rural residents, low socioeconomic status patients, and racial/ethnic minorities have the lowest participation rates due to access barriers. Internet-and mobile-based lifestyle interventions have emerged as potential modalities to complement and increase accessibility to CR. An outpatient CR program using virtual world technology may provide an effective alternative to conventional CR by overcoming patient access limitations such as geographics, work schedule constraints, and transportation. Objective: The objective of this paper is to describe the research protocol of a two-phased, pilot study that will assess the feasibility (Phase 1) and comparative effectiveness (Phase 2) of a virtual world-based (Second Life) CR program as an extension of a conventional CR program in achieving healthy behavioral change among post-acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and post-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) patients. We hypothesize that virtual world CR users will improve behaviors (physical activity, diet, and smoking) to a greater degree than conventional CR participants. Methods: In Phase 1, we will recruit at least 10 patients enrolled in outpatient CR who were recently hospitalized for an ACS (unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) or who recently underwent elective PCI at Mayo Clinic Hospital, Rochester Campus in Rochester, MN with at least one modifiable, lifestyle risk factor target (sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy diet, and current smoking). Recruited patients will participate in a 12-week, virtual world health education program which will provide feedback on the feasibility, usability, and design of the intervention. During Phase 2, we will conduct a 2-arm, parallel group, single-center, randomized controlled trial (RCT). Patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to adjunct virtual world-based CR with conventional CR or conventional CR only. The primary outcome is a composite including at least one of the following (1) at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week, (2) daily consumption of five or more fruits and vegetables, and (3) smoking cessation. Patients will be assessed at 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: The Phase 1 feasibility study is currently open for recruitment which will be followed by the Phase 2 RCT. The anticipated completion date for the study is May 2016. Conclusions: While research on the use of virtual world technology in health programs is in its infancy, it offers unique advantages over current Web-based health interventions including social interactivity and active learning. It also increases accessibility to vulnerable populations who have higher burdens of CVD. This study will yield results on the effectiveness of a virtual world-based CR program as an innovative platform to influence healthy lifestyle behavior and self-efficacy."
s_250,Machine Learning: Two Levels of Meta-Learning. Base Learning: This involves the application of machine learning algorithms to solve specific tasks. The focus is on optimizing the performance of these algorithms on given datasets .,"Meta-learning has arisen as a powerful tool for many machine learning problems. With multiple factors to be considered when designing learning models for real-world applications, meta-learning with multiple objectives has attracted much attention recently. However, existing works either linearly combine multiple objectives into one objective or adopt evolutionary algorithms to handle it, where the former approach needs to pay high computational cost to tune the combination coefficients while the latter approach is computationally heavy and incapable to be integrated into gradient-based optimization. To alleviate those limitations, in this paper, we aim to propose a generic gradient-based Multi-Objective Meta-Learning (MOML) framework with applications in many machine learning problems. Specifically, the MOML framework formulates the objective function of meta-learning with multiple objectives as a Multi-Objective Bi-Level optimization Problem (MOBLP) where the upper-level subproblem is to solve several possibly conflicting objectives for the meta-learner. Different from those existing works, in this paper, we propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the MOBLP. Specifically, we devise the first gradient-based optimization algorithm by alternately solving the lower-level and upper-level subproblems via the gradient descent method and the gradient-based multi-objective optimization method, respectively. Theoretically, we prove the convergence property and provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the proposed gradient-based optimization algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MOML framework for different learning problems, including few-shot learning, domain adaptation, multi-task learning, neural architecture search, and reinforcement learning. The source code of MOML is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/MOML.
[4]: Meta-learning optimizes an inductive bias - typically in the form of the hyperparameters of a base-learning algorithm - by observing data from a finite number of related tasks. This paper presents an information-theoretic bound on the generalization performance of any given meta-learner, which builds on the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). In the proposed extension to meta-learning, the CMI bound involves a training meta-supersample obtained by first sampling 2N independent tasks from the task environment, and then drawing 2M independent training samples for each sampled task. The meta-training data fed to the meta-learner is modelled as being obtained by randomly selecting N tasks from the available 2N tasks and M training samples per task from the available 2M training samples per task. The resulting bound is explicit in two CMI terms, which measure the information that the meta-learner output and the base-learner output provide about which training data are selected, given the entire meta-supersample. Finally, we present a numerical example that illustrates the merits of the proposed bound in comparison to prior information-theoretic bounds for meta-learning."

Inconsistent implementation of TB screening and treatment, especially in rural areas, exacerbates the problem .","Background: The current prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in the People's Republic of China (P. R. China) demonstrates geographical heterogeneities, which show that the TB prevalence in the remote areas ofWestern China is more serious than that in the coastal plain of Eastern China. Although a lot of ecological studies have been applied in the exploration on the regional difference of disease risks, there is still a paucity of ecological studies on TB prevalence in P. R. China. Objective: To understand the underlying factors contributing to the regional inequity of TB burden in P. R. China by using an ecological approach and, thus, aiming to provide a basis to eliminate the TB spatial heterogeneity in the near future. Design: Latent ecological variables were identified by using exploratory factor analysis from data obtained from four sources, i.e. the databases of the National TB Control Programme (2001-2010) in P. R. China, the China Health Statistical Yearbook during 2002-2011, the China Statistical Yearbook during 2002-2011, and the provincial government websites in 2013. Partial least squares path modelling was chosen to construct the structural equation model to evaluate the relationship between TB prevalence and ecological variables. Furthermore, a geographically weighted regression model was used to explore the local spatial heterogeneity in the relationships. Results: The latent ecological variables in terms of 'TB prevalence', 'TB investment', 'TB service', 'health investment', 'health level', 'economic level', 'air quality', 'climatic factor' and 'geographic factor' were identified. With the exception of TB service and health levels, other ecological factors had explicit and significant impacts on TB prevalence to varying degrees. Additionally, each ecological factor had different impacts on TB prevalence in different regions significantly. Conclusion: Ecological factors that were found predictive of TB prevalence in P. R. China are essential to take into account in the formulation of locally comprehensive strategies and interventions aiming to tailor the TB control and prevention programme into local settings in each ecozone.
[7]: Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of infectious disease deaths worldwide. What is perhaps less appreciated is that the caseload of tuberculosis patients in South Asia is staggering. South Asia has almost 40% of the global TB burden with 4,028,165 cases in 2015. This region also has a disproportionate share of TB deaths (681,975 deaths, 38% of the global burden). Worldwide just 12.5% of TB cases are in HIV positive individuals, but much research and investment has focused on HIV-associated TB. Only 3.5% of patients with tuberculosis in South Asia have HIV co-infection. Not surprisingly with such a huge burden of disease, this region has an estimated 184,336 multi drug resistant (MDR) cases among notified TB cases which accounts for a third of global MDR burden. Crucially, at least 70% of the estimated MDR cases remain untreated in this region and MDR treatment success ranged from only 46% for India to 88% for Sri Lanka in the 2012 cohort that received treatment. This region represents many of the drivers of the modern TB epidemic: rapid urbanization and high density populations with dramatically rising incidence of diabetes, a burgeoning and largely unregulated private sector with escalating drug resistance and high air pollution both outdoor and household. Conclusion: From bacterial biochemistry to policy implementation, we suggest ways in which South Asia can seize the opportunity lead global TB elimination by demonstrating feasibility in some of the world's most densely populated cities and remotest reaches of the Himalayas. Clearly political will is essential, but we cannot defeat TB without understanding how to eliminate it in South Asia.
[10]: Background:Health care workers (HCWs) are at risk of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). In China, tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem, but the prevalence of LTBI in HCWs especially in the hospital for pulmonary diseases has not been assessed enough. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and putative risk factors of LTBI among HCWs in a chest hospital and a TB research institute in China.Methodology/Principal Findings:A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs in China in 2012. LTBI was assessed by T-SPOT.TB, and information on HCWs was collected using a standardised questionnaire. Risk factors for LTBI were analyzed by univariate and multivariate regression. The overall prevalence of LTBI among HCWs was 33.6%. Analyzed by job category, the highest prevalence was found among laboratory staff (43.4%). In the different workplaces, the proportion of LTBI was significantly higher among the high risk workplaces (37.4%) compared to the low risk workplaces. The duration of employment had a significant impact on the prevalence of LTBI. Positive T-SPOT.TB test results accounted for 17.6%, 16.8%, 23.5%, 41.8% and 41.6% in groups of ≤2, 3-5, 6-10, 11-20, and >20 working years respectively. In multivariate analysis, job categories (Laboratory staff [2.76 (95% CI: 1.36; 5.60)], technician staff [2.02 (95% CI: 1.12; 3.64)]); working duration as a HCW for 11 to 20 years [3.57 (95% CI: 1.46; 8.71)], and 20 years above [3.41 (95% CI: 1.28; 9.11)]; and the history of household TB contact [2.47 (95% CI: 1.15; 5.33)] were associated with increased risk of LTBI.Conclusions/Significance:Prevalence of LTBI estimated by T-SPOT.TB is high among Chinese HCWs and working duration, job category and the history of household TB contact were associated with increased risk. These data highlight adequate infection control measures should be undertaken. © 2013 Zhang et al."

Previous studies demonstrated that cacao flavanols decrease pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in the alleviation of allergic symptoms. We sought to investigate the effects of cacao extract (CE) on Dermatophagoides farinae extract (DFE)-induced atopic dermatitis (AD)-like symptoms. CE attenuated DFE-induced AD-like symptoms as assessed by skin lesion analyses, dermatitis score, and skin thickness. Histopathological analysis revealed that CE suppressed DFE-induced immune cell infiltration into the skin. These observations occurred concomitantly with the downregulation of inflammatory markers including serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E, chemokine; thymus and activation-regulated chemokine and macrophage-derived chemokine as well as the skin-derived cytokines interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, and interferon-γ. CE also significantly alleviated transepidermal water loss and increased skin hydration. These results suggest that CE, a natural phytochemical-rich food, has potential therapeutic efficacy for the treatment of AD."
s_1495,"Management Strategies: Fungicide Application: The use of fungicides has been shown to be effective in controlling BLS, suggesting that without them, plant health and productivity would significantly decline .","This study aimed to evaluate development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' under different management systems with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP (Brazil). For the experiment it was used micropropagated seedlings of 'Grande Naine' banana that was planted in field in a completely randomized design with five treatments (management systems): interspersed planting; fungicide control; defoliation + interspersed planting; defoliation + fungicide control and control, which were subdivided in time (two production cycles), with eight repetition and one plant per repetition. It was evaluated the following parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, marketable fruits fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, number of fruit, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2<sup>nd</sup> hand, length and diameter of 2<sup>nd</sup> hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey's test (5% probability). It can be conclude that fungicides applications were effective for black leaf streak control, showing better results in plants development and production and also in fruit quality of cultivars Grande Naine. No differences were observed when fungicide application was associated with defoliation. The interspersed planting affected negatively all the development and production parameters of cultivar Grande Naine.
[5]: Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet) causes important losses to banana production. Use of fungicides has been the most efficient control to this foliar disease. The development of innovative strategies to diminish conventional chemical control dependency is a permanent challenge for a sustainable and environmentally respectful agriculture. The objective of this research was to evaluate mutualist endophytic fungi to control black Sigatoka in the field. The experiment was established on a farm in Obispo, County in Barinas. A randomized complete block design was arranged with four treatment and 30 plants as experimental unit. Banana (cv. Grand Naine) vitro plants and corms inoculated separately with Trichoderma atroviride strains (E1 and E2) were utilized. Black Sigatoka severity and incidence were evaluated using Fouré (1985) and Gauhl (1989) scales and following Marin and Romero (1998) methodology. During the vegetative period, the following variables were recorded: evolution state (ES), foliar emission rhythm (RER), total leaves (TL), youngest diseased leaf (YDL) and infection index (IND). At flowering, only one reading was done for TLF, YDLF and INDF, along with the following phenological variables: period from planting to flowering (PPF), plant height at flowering (PHF) and pseudostem circumference to flowering (PCF). Although there were no significant differences within treatment observed, E1 shows the lowest values on IND, INDF y HMJE and the best values on TH and REF with over 16% in both variables above the witness."
i_1410,"Impact of Weight Loss Surgery: Weight loss surgery, while effective for weight loss, often leads to nutritional deficiencies that can manifest as skin lesions: Micronutrient Deficiencies: Post-surgery, patients frequently experience deficiencies in vitamins and minerals such as iron, folate, vitamin B1, B12, and vitamin D, which can lead to various skin issues .","Bariatric surgery leads to a significant body weight reduction, and improvement of obesity-related comorbidities. However, it is associated with a higher risk of presenting some nutritional deficiencies. These deficiencies are especially relevant after mixed or malabsorptive procedures. Deficiencies in micronutrients after bariatric procedures are a known threat if not corrected appropriately. Though zinc deficiency is not considered among the most frequent deficiencies after bariatric surgery, several studies have shown that its frequency might overcome 10%, even after restrictive procedures and in patients with multivitamin supplements intake.Zinc is the second most prevalent trace found in the human body after iron. It is essential for normal cell function and metabolism, playing a central role in over 300 enzymatic reactions, and protects cells from free radical damage. The central role of zinc in cell growth and differentiation explains the dramatic effect of zinc deficiency in tissues with a rapid cell turnover such as hair growth. In recent years much interest has been generated by the possibility that subclinical zinc deficiency may significantly increase the incidence of and morbidity and mortality from diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infections. Clinical manifestations of zinc deficiency include delayed sexual maturation, impotence, hypogonadism, oligospermia, alopecia, dysgeusia, immune dysfunction, night blindness, impaired wound healing, and various skin lesions. After bariatric surgery, zinc deficiency is often associated with other micronutrients deficiencies, mainly iron. It has been demonstrated that zinc and iron levels, both within the normal range, but close to the minimum level of the range, can be associated with hair loss, mainly between the 6th and 9th postoperative month. For the evaluation of zinc status, plasma levels are generally a good index of zinc status in healthy individuals. Zinc supplements are usually indicated for patients with low zinc levels, depending upon the clinical context. In obese patients after bariatric surgery, zinc supplementation can be considered even in patients with serum levels within the normal range, when iron levels are also close to the minimum value of normality and the patient complain of alopecia.
[5]: The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity is associated with an increase of obesity surgery and metabolic surgery as well. Several surgical and especially metabolic problems after restrictive and malabsorptive bariatric procedures will be noted in these patients. Restrictive bariatric procedures are associated with pouch dilatation or band migration after gastric banding or a severe reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy. The most commonly deficiencies after restrictive procedures are deficiencies of B-vitamins. Iron, folate, vitamin B1 and B12 and vita-min D deficiencies are associated with the malabsorptive procedure like biliopancreatic diversion, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery require medical follow-up lifelong for reasons that are often determined by the type of surgical procedure performed. The majority of this report will deal with the metabolic problems associated with the bariatric procedures. Patients should be carefully screened and encouraged to consume vitamin and mineral supplementation after surgery, immediately. © 2012."
i_1336,"Clinical Presentation: Age and Incidence: Both cancers primarily affect children and adolescents. Osteosarcoma has a higher incidence in the 15-29 age group, while Ewing sarcoma is more common in younger patients, typically under 20 years old .","Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are the most common bone malignancies that affect children and adolescents, with an incidence of six new cases/1,000,000 inhabitants/year, accounting for approximately 7% of cancer diagnoses. They may be defined as neoplastic diseases that involve the bone tissues, the former arising from the mesenchymal bone forming cells and the latter from the neural crest cells.
[3]: Object. Malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasms are aggressive tumors that remain associated with poor outcomes despite aggressive multidisciplinary treatment measures. To date, prognosis for patients with these tumors is based on results from small single-center patient series and controlled trials. Large population-based observational studies are lacking. To assess national trends in histology-specific survival, the authors reviewed patient survival data spanning 30 years (1973-2003) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, a US population-based cancer registry. Methods. The SEER registry was queried to identify cases of histologically confirmed primary spinal chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma using coding from the International Classification of Disease for Oncology, Third Edition. Association of survival with histology, metastasis status, tumor site, and year of diagnosis was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis. Results. A total of 1892 patients were identified with primary osseous spinal neoplasms (414 with chordomas, 579 with chondrosarcomas, 430 with osteosarcomas, and 469 with Ewing sarcomas). Chordomas presented in older patients (60 ± 17 years; p < 0.01) whereas Ewing sarcoma presented in younger patients (19 ± 11 years; p < 0.01) compared with patients with all other tumors. The relative incidence of each tumor type remained similar per decade from 1973 to 2003. African Americans comprised a significantly greater proportion of patients with osteosarcomas than other tumors (9.6% vs 3.5%, respectively; p < 0.01). Compared with the sacrum, the mobile spine was more likely to be the site of tumor location for chordomas than for all other tumors (47% vs 23%, respectively; p < 0.05). Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma were 3 times more likely than chondrosarcoma and chordoma to present with metastasis (31% vs 8%, respectively). Resection was performed more frequently for chordoma (88%) and chondrosarcoma (89%) than for osteosarcoma (61%) and Ewing sarcoma (53%). Overall median survival was histology-specific (osteosarcoma, 11 months; Ewing sarcoma, 26 months; chondrosarcoma, 37 months; chordoma, 50 months) and significantly worse in patients with metastasis at presentation for all tumor types. Survival did not significantly differ as a function of site (mobile spine vs sacrum/pelvis) for any tumor type, but more recent year of diagnosis was associated with improved survival for isolated spinal Ewing sarcoma (hazard ration [HR] 0.95; p = 0.001), chondrosarcoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.009), and chordoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.10), but not osteosarcoma. Conclusions. In this analysis of a 30-year, US population-based cancer registry (SEER), the authors provide nationally representative prognosis and survival data for patients with malignant primary spinal osseous neoplasms. Overall patient survival has improved for isolated spine tumors with advancements in care over the past 4 decades. These results may be helpful in providing historical controls for understanding the efficacy of new treatment paradigms, patient education, and guiding level of aggressiveness in treatment strategies.
[4]: Background: There is a paucity of recent epidemiological data on bone cancers. The aim of this study was to describe incidence and survival patterns for bone cancers diagnosed during 1981 - 2002.Methods: Cases aged 0 - 39 years (236 osteosarcomas, 166 Ewing sarcomas and 73 chondrosarcomas) were analysed using Poisson and Cox regressions.Results: Incidence rates (per million persons per year) for osteosarcoma were 2.5 at age 0 - 14 years; 4.5 at age 15 - 29 years and 1.0 at age 30 - 39 years. Similarly, for Ewing sarcoma the incidence rates were 2.2; 2.9; 0.4 and for chondrosarcoma rates were 0.1; 1.2; 1.8 respectively. Incidence of osteosarcoma increased at an average annual rate of 2.5% (95% CI 0.4 - 4.7; P = 0.02), but there was no change in incidence of Ewing sarcoma or chondrosarcoma. There was a marginally statistically significant improvement in survival for Ewing sarcoma (hazard ratio (HR) per annum = 0.97; 95% CI 0.94 - 1.00; P = 0.06), although patients aged 15 - 39 years (n = 93) had worse overall survival than those aged 0 - 14 (n = 73; HR = 1.46; 95% CI 0.98 - 2.17; P = 0.06). There was no significant improvement in osteosarcoma survival (HR per annum = 0.98; 95% CI 0.95 - 1.01; P = 0.18).Conclusions: Reasons for poorer survival in Ewing sarcoma patients aged 15 - 39 years and failure to significantly improve survival for osteosarcoma patients requires further investigation. © 2010 Eyre et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the community awareness towards domestic waste management. This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia. The questionnaire consists of five sections with a total of 57 questions. The questionnaire consists of four parts: Socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude and practice. The data were analysed using SPSS version 22.0. T-test, ANOVA test, Chi-squared test were used according to the type of variables and significance level will be taken at 95% or p-value of less than 0.05. A total of 355 respondents participated in this study. The mean age was 40.52 ±14.94. The majority of them were male (52.1%), Malay (71.0%), married (71.3%), with secondary educational (81%) and employed (41.1%). The majority of respondents mentioned that inappropriate waste management can cause dengue fever and leptospirosis (98.0%, 97.2%; respectively). Property type, education, occupation, ethnicity, religions and household income were significant influenced the knowledge of the participants towards domestic waste management. For attitude, gender, education, ethnicity, religion and income significantly influenced the attitude of the participants towards domestic waste management. For practice, ethnicity, religion and occupation were significantly influenced the practice of the participants towards domestic waste management. In conclusion, the community has moderate awareness of domestic waste management. Awareness of waste management should also be taught in school so that the next generation of people will have a better understanding and eventually have better practice in domestic waste management. It is also hoped that a carefully thought-out strategy can be developed to further improve the community awareness towards domestic waste management which will shed a new light on tackling this issue.

s_973,"VR training has shown to improve performance in live exercises, such as pediatric emergency department (PED) emergency evacuations, indicating its effectiveness in promoting positive performance outcomes .","Objective: This study examined differences in learning outcomes among newborn intensive care unit (NICU) workers who underwent virtual reality simulation (VRS) emergency evacuation training versus those who received web-based clinical updates (CU). Learning outcomes included a) knowledge gained, b) confidence with evacuation, and c) performance in a live evacuation exercise. Methods: A longitudinal, mixed-method, quasi-experimental design was implemented utilizing a sample of NICU workers randomly assigned to VRS training or CUs. Four VRS scenarios were created that augmented neonate evacuation training materials. Learning was measured using cognitive assessments, self-efficacy questionnaire (baseline, 0, 4, 8, 12 months), and performance in a live drill (baseline, 12 months). Data were collected following training and analyzed using mixed model analysis. Focus groups captured VRS participant experiences. Results: The VRS and CU groups did not statistically differ based upon the scores on the Cognitive Assessment or perceived self-efficacy. The virtual reality group performance in the live exercise was statistically (P<.0001) and clinically (effect size of 1.71) better than that of the CU group. Conclusions: Training using VRS is effective in promoting positive performance outcomes and should be included as a method for disaster training. VRS can allow an organization to train, test, and identify gaps in current emergency operation plans. In the unique case of disasters, which are low-volume and high-risk events, the participant can have access to an environment without endangering themselves or clients."

[2]: Neural networks are increasingly used in the field of hydrology due to their properties of parsimony and universal approximation with regard to nonlinear systems. Nevertheless, as a result of the existence of noise and approximations in hydrological data, which are very significant in some cases, such systems are particularly sensitive to increased model complexity. This dilemma is known in machine learning as bias-variance and can be avoided by suitable regularization methods. Following a presentation of the bias-variance dilemma along with regularization methods such as cross-validation, early stopping and weight decay, an application is provided for simulating and forecasting karst aquifer outflows at the Lez site. The efficiency of this regularization process is thus demonstrated on a nonlinear, partially unknown basin. As a last step, results are presented over the most intense rainfall event found in the database, which allows assessing the capability of neural networks to generalize with rare or extreme events. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.
[3]: Effective training of deep neural networks suffers from two main issues. The first is that the parameter spaces of these models exhibit pathological curvature. Recent methods address this problem by using adaptive preconditioning for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). These methods improve convergence by adapting to the local geometry of parameter space. A second issue is overfitting, which is typically addressed by early stopping. However, recent work has demonstrated that Bayesian model averaging mitigates this problem. The posterior can be sampled by using Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD). However, the rapidly changing curvature renders default SGLD methods inefficient. Here, we propose combining adaptive preconditioners with SGLD. In support of this idea, we give theoretical properties on asymptotic convergence and predictive risk.We also provide empirical results for Logistic Regression, Feedforward Neural Nets, and Convolutional Neural Nets, demonstrating that our preconditioned SGLD method gives state-of-the-art performance on these models.
[4]: Early classification of time series is valuable in many real-world applications such as early disease prediction, early disaster prediction, and patient monitoring where data are generated over time. The main objective of early classification is to provide a reliable class prediction earliest in time. In general, whenever the early prediction time improves, the prediction accuracy decreases. Thus, the trade-off between earliness and accuracy needs to be addressed. In this article, we proposed an optimization-based early classification model for time series data using early stopping rules (ESRs) and a series of probabilistic classifiers. ESRs are developed through particle swarm optimization by minimizing the well-defined cost function that considers the missclassification cost and delaying decision cost simultaneously. The experimental results on 30 standard datasets demonstrate good performance for early classification in comparison to state of the art methods. Also, the proposed model is tested for early malware detection on a real dataset and shows decent performance by balancing the accuracy and earliness.
[5]: Lengthy evaluation times are common in many optimization problems such as direct policy search tasks, especially when they involve conducting evaluations in the physical world, for example, in robotics applications. Often when evaluating solution over a fixed time period, it becomes clear that the objective value will not increase with additional computation time (e.g., when a two-wheeled robot continuously spins on the spot). In such cases, it makes sense to stop the evaluation early to save computation time. However, most approaches to stop the evaluation are problem specific and need to be specifically designed for the task at hand. Therefore, we propose an early stopping method for direct policy search. The proposed method only looks at the objective value at each timestep and requires no problem-specific knowledge. We test the introduced stopping criterion in five direct policy search environments drawn from games, robotics, and classic control domains and show that it can save up to of the computation time. We also compare it with problem-specific stopping criteria and show that it performs comparably, while being more generally applicable.
[6]: These days deep learning is the fastest-growing area in the field of Machine Learning. Convolutional Neural Networks are currently the main tool used for the image analysis and classification purposes. Although great achievements and perspectives, deep neural networks and accompanying learning algorithms have some relevant challenges to tackle. In this paper, we have focused on the most frequently mentioned problem in the field of machine learning, that is relatively poor generalization abilities. Partial remedies for this are regularization techniques e.g. dropout, batch normalization, weight decay, transfer learning, early stopping and data augmentation. In this paper we have focused on data augmentation. We propose to use a method based on a neural style transfer, which allows to generate new unlabeled images of high perceptual quality that combine the content of a base image with the appearance of another one. In a proposed approach, the newly created images are described with pseudo-labels, and then used as a training dataset. Real, labeled images are divided into the validation and test set. We validated proposed method on a challenging skin lesion classification case study. Four representative neural architectures are examined. Obtained results show the strong potential of the proposed approach.
[7]: Clickbait is an elusive challenge with the prevalence of social media such as Facebook and Twitter that misleads the readers while clicking on headlines. Limited annotated data makes it onerous to design an accurate clickbait identification system. The authors address this problem by purposing deep learning-based architecture with external knowledge which trains on social media post and descriptions. The pre-trained ELMO and BERT model obtains the sentence level contextual feature as knowledge; moreover, the LSTM layer helps to prevail the word level contextual feature. Training has done at different experiments (model with EMLO, model with BERT) with different regularization techniques such as dropout, early stopping, and finetuning. Forward context-aware clickbait tweet identification system (FCCTI) with BERT finetuning and model with ELMO using glove pre-trained embedding is the best model and achieves a clickbait identification accuracy of 0.847, improving on the previous baseline for this task."

i_1279,"Risk Factors: HIV-positive status is a significant risk factor for mental health disorders among adolescents. The perceived risk of HIV infection negatively impacts mental health outcomes, regardless of actual HIV status .","BACKGROUND The emerging literature on HIV/AIDS and mental health in sub-Saharan Africa stresses that HIV-positive status is significantly related to mental illness. However, the literature has neglected an equally important concern in contexts where HIV is highly prevalent, namely, whether and how an HIV/AIDS epidemic affects the mental well-being of individuals in thegeneral population, regardless of their HIV status. OBJECTIVE This paper adopts an innovative perspective for addressing this public mental health concern in sub-Saharan Africa. It examines the relationship between perceived risk of HIV infection and mental health in rural Malawi and evaluates four psychosocial mechanisms that potentially influence the relationship, including (1) worry about being infected and fear of death, (2) health and economic conditions, (3) social support, and (4) the stigma of HIV/AIDS. METHODS The analysis uses data from the MalawiLongitudinal Study of Families and Health collected in 2006 and 2008. Random-effects and fixed-effects linear regression models are used to predict mental health status (measured by the SF-12 Mental Component Summary scale). RESULTS Regardless of HIV status, the perceived risk of infection has a strong negative relationship with mental health outcomes. This relationship isi part associated with the individual's health, fear of death (or pessimism about survival), an marital/cohabitation status. © 2013 Ning Hsieh."
i_1409,"Nutritional Deficiencies and Skin Lesions: Vitamin D Deficiency: Common in obese individuals, vitamin D deficiency can exacerbate skin conditions like psoriasis and may contribute to other dermatological issues .","The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity is associated with an increase of obesity surgery and metabolic surgery as well. Several surgical and especially metabolic problems after restrictive and malabsorptive bariatric procedures will be noted in these patients. Restrictive bariatric procedures are associated with pouch dilatation or band migration after gastric banding or a severe reflux disease after sleeve gastrectomy. The most commonly deficiencies after restrictive procedures are deficiencies of B-vitamins. Iron, folate, vitamin B1 and B12 and vita-min D deficiencies are associated with the malabsorptive procedure like biliopancreatic diversion, duodenal switch and Roux-en-Y-gastric bypass. Patients who have undergone bariatric surgery require medical follow-up lifelong for reasons that are often determined by the type of surgical procedure performed. The majority of this report will deal with the metabolic problems associated with the bariatric procedures. Patients should be carefully screened and encouraged to consume vitamin and mineral supplementation after surgery, immediately. © 2012."

Impact: AI has shown significant economic benefits, though there are concerns about ethical issues and job displacement.","As a result of the instability of oil prices, the economic prospects of the Gulf region are increasing their focus on new technologies. Thus, Saudi Arabia has demonstrated a strong commitment towards the development and implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies as alternative sources for revenue and growth in line with globalisation, development, and the vision 2030. This paper examines the impact of AI in the Saudi Arabia community, especially for social and economic evolution. Special focus on the use of smart cars and smart cameras to monitor intelligently traffic, public services and national security is explored. A total of 424 participants from Eastern Province took part in this study. Analysis and discussion of the obtained results are also presented. The findings showed that 75.71% of participants mostly highly agreed about the AI economic impact leading to an increase in both government and business financial incomes. Whereas only 59.84% of participants mostly highly agreed about the social impact of AI as they are worried about AI ethical concerns, job loss and the changing workforce."
s_1729,"Re-flooding: Once the water level reaches the threshold, the field is re-flooded to a depth of about 5-15 cm. This cycle of wetting and drying is repeated throughout the growing season .","The supply of irrigation in Thailand is currently insufficient to satisfy rice production demands, despite the country being the world's leading rice producer and exporter. Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.
[3]: We carried out a pool culture experiment to determine the optimal water treatment depth in loam and clay soils during the late growth stage of super rice. Three controlled water depth treatments of 0–5, 0–10 and 0–15 cm below the soil surface were established using alternate wetting and drying irrigation, and the soil water potential (0 to –25 kPa) was measured at 5, 10 and 15 cm. A 2-cm water layer was used as the control. We measured soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and rice yield. The results showed that the 0–5-cm water depth treatment significantly increased root antioxidant enzyme activities in loam soil compared with the control, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield did not differ from those of the control. The 0–10- and 0–15-cm water depth treatments also increased root antioxidant enzyme activities, whereas soil enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters and yield decreased. In clay soil, the soil enzyme activities, root antioxidant enzyme activities, chlorophyll fluorescence parameters, and yield did not change with the 0–5-cm water treatment, whereas the 0–10- and 0–15-cm water treatments improved these parameters. Therefore, the appropriate depths for soil water during the late growth period of rice with a 0 to –25 kPa water potential were 5 cm in loam and 15 cm in clay soil."

These issues can hinder the integration of blockchain with Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and AI systems, which require efficient and scalable data management solutions.","With developments in human societies and the information and communication technology, the Internet of Things (IoT) has penetrated various aspects of daily life and different industries. The newly emerging blockchain technology has become a viable solution to the IoT security due to its inherent characteristics such as distribution, security, immutability, and traceability. However, integrating the IoT with the blockchain technology faces certain challenges such as latency, throughput, device power limitation, and scalability. Recent studies have focused on the role of artificial intelligence methods in improving the IoT performance in a blockchain. According to their results, there are only a few effects on the improvement of IoT-based performance with limited power. This study proposes a conceptual model to improve the blockchain throughput in IoT-based devices with limited power through deep reinforcement learning. This model benefits from a recommender agent based on deep reinforcement learning in the mobile edge computing layer to improve the throughput and select the right mining method.
[2]: Blockchains are a key disruptive technology of recent times with applications across several application domains such as finance, supply chain, healthcare and Industry 4.0. With growing application types, scalability of blockchains has emerged as a key challenge in achieving the potential of this technology. This paper attempts to outline this challenge for blockchains as follows. It highlights blockchain scalability as a composite concept which can be interpreted in various ways i.e. expanding the number of participants of the network, or enhancing capabilities of the participants (such as processing, memory, storage or an efficient consensus strategy) to minimize the scalability overhead. Further, it presents a first thorough systemic study of existing efforts to achieve blockchain scalability with respect to; (i) innovative methods and mechanisms to strengthen blockchain's capabilities with respect to scalability, (ii) approaches leveraging blockchains to achieve scalable applications, and (iii) efforts analyzing blockchain solutions with respect to scalability. Through a critical analysis of existing literature, the paper identifies contributions as well as open challenges which can help research community to advance knowledge within this domain.
[3]: —Blockchain is an emerging technology that would possibly disrupt the existing centralized financial systems lead to the rise to a new technology era for the financial sector. Additionally, different new use cases such as healthcare, identity management, etc. suggest that Blockchain has much wider applications. Blockchain is founded on distributed ledger technology that ensures trust through consensus between parties in a peer-to-peer network instead of the need to a third party or central authority. However, blockchain has several limitations such as scalability, latency, low throughput which are the main barriers for Blockchain being adopted by the industries. Of all, scalability is the most critical limitation of blockchain that needs an efficient and effective solution. In this paper, we aim to enhance the scalability of blockchain by designing and implementing a massively scalable architecture for private blockchain-based applications, called ElasticBloC. To evaluate our contribution, we conducted several experiments on ElasticBloC. The results showed that ElasticBloC is a high-performant architecture that scales massively.
[4]: Recently, blockchain technology accumulates and stores all transactions. Therefore, in order to verify the contents of all transactions, the data itself is compressed, but the scalability is limited. In addition, since a separate verification algorithm is used for each type of transaction, the verification burden increases as the size of the transaction increases. Existing blockchain cannot participate in the network because it does not become a block sink by using a server with a low specification. Due to this problem, as the time passes, the data size of the blockchain network becomes larger and it becomes impossible to participate in the network except for users with abundant resources. Therefore, in this paper, we studied the zero knowledge proof algorithm for general operation verification. In this system, the design of zero-knowledge circuit generator capable of general operation verification and optimization of verifier and prover were also conducted. Also, we developed an algorithm for optimizing key generation. Based on all of these, the zero-knowledge proof algorithm was applied to and tested on the virtual machine so that it can be used universally on all blockchains."

Supply Chain Inefficiencies: The agricultural supply chain in Indonesia is inefficient due to the involvement of multiple layers of intermediaries, which complicates the distribution of organic products .","The importance of the Indonesian agriculture supply chain lies in the vision of the national government with regard to food security and farmer welfare which supports the production of various healthy types of food and high value-added products utilising local resources. However, local agricultural products face certain inefficient business practices, due to the involvement of multi-layer parties in the distribution network, which serves the ultimate consumers. Previous studies involving research into agriculture only provide a partial description of both conventional agriculture and the organic agricultural supply chains. Therefore, this paper attempts to provide a comprehensive description of all agribusiness parties by reproducing the agricultural product supply chain network operating under prevailing conditions in West Java, Indonesia, using tomato products as a case study. This paper analyses two types of tomato agribusiness, conventional and organic, in order to identify possible differences in the supply chain process and their contrasting interactions. The value system method is examined to highlight the dynamics of the interrelationship between several participating parties."
i_1981,Drawbacks: Hinders planners from developing environmentally sustainable waterfronts and compromises economic viability .,"Waterfronts are a critical site for urban redevelopment in the early 21st century. However many waterfront sites have serious environmental problems, especially the management of contaminated stormwater, which contemporary models of waterfront development do little to remedy. Why? While there is a good understanding of techniques that are viable for the remediation of urban stormwater, they are often ignored or treated as a design novelty. The author suggests that the cause is to be found in the way market forces dominate waterfront development models. Contemporary urban theory such as new urbanism is complicit with these forces, advocating an urban planning model with a high FAR (Floor Area Ratio) and large areas of impervious surface. The author proposes the development of an alternative waterfront development strategy using GIS-based mapping. Focusing on how the remediation of urban stormwater could drive the development of a new model of urban development on the waterfront, the author uses GIS mapping to explore the effect of pervious and impervious surfaces on the production of stormwater in an urban catchment. In a similar way GIS mapping is used to simulate different urban densities. A case study project on the Wynyard Quarter, Auckland, New Zealand is used to explore these techniques. The result is the development of a GIS model that models the consequences of increased density on urban stormwater remediation within a catchment. The model helps planners and developers to conceive an environmental sustainable urban waterfront while ensuring an economically viable return."
i_1918,"Objectives of Using the ecoinvent Database in LCAs: Supporting Decision-Making: By providing detailed life cycle inventory (LCI) data, ecoinvent helps decision-makers identify environmental hotspots and make informed choices to improve sustainability without shifting burdens elsewhere .","Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become widely recognized as an effective tool for assessing the resource use, environmental burdens, and human health impacts connected with the complete life cycle of products, processes, and activities. This systems approach enables decision-makers to identify environmental hot spots, as well as improve industrial systems without shifting burdens elsewhere. An LCA begins with a clearly stated goal. The goal helps to establish the study boundaries and guides the data collection efforts. The ISO standard provides a general framework for conducting an LCA, but it is open to much interpretation by the practitioner. LCAs can produce different results even if the same product seems to be the focus of the study. Numerous factors might account for such differences, including different goal statements, differ ent functional units, different boundaries, and different assumptions used to model the data. The UNEP/SETAC Life Cycle Initiative developed a guidance document for Organizational LCA, which provides guidance to enable organizations to more easily and more effectively apply ISO 14040 and ISO 14044 at the organizational level.
[6]: The US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) launched the Resource Conservation Challenge (RCC) in 2002 to help reduce waste and move towards more sustainable resource consumption. The objective of the RCC is to help communities, industries, and the public think in terms of materials management rather than waste disposal. Reducing cost, finding more efficient and effective strategies to manage municipal waste, and thinking in terms of materials management requires a holistic approach that considers life-cycle environmental tradeoffs. The US EPA's National Risk Management Research Laboratory has led the development of a municipal solid waste decision support tool (MSW-DST). The computer software can be used to calculate life-cycle environmental tradeoffs and full costs of different waste management or materials recovery programs. The environmental methodology is based on the use of life-cycle assessment and the cost methodology is based on the use of full-cost accounting. Life-cycle inventory (LCI) environmental impacts and costs are calculated from the point of collection, handling, transport, treatment, and disposal. For any materials that are recovered for recycling, offsets are calculated to reflect potential emissions savings from use of virgin materials. The use of the MSW-DST provides a standardized format and consistent basis to compare alternatives. This paper provides an illustration of how the MSW-DST can be used by evaluating ten management strategies for a hypothetical medium-sized community to compare the life-cycle environmental and cost tradeoffs. The LCI results from the MSW-DST are then used as inputs into another US EPA tool, the Tool for the reduction and assessment of chemical and other environmental impacts, to convert the LCI results into impact indicators. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate how the MSW-DST can be used to identify and balance multiple criteria (costs and environmental impacts) when evaluating options for materials and waste management. This type of approach is needed in identifying strategies that lead to reduced waste and more sustainable resource consumption. This helps to meet the goals established in the US EPA's Resource Conservation Challenge."
s_1526,Key Functions of PHT4: Phosphate Uptake and Transport: PHT4 transporters are involved in the active uptake of inorganic phosphate from the soil. This process is critical for ensuring that plants have sufficient phosphate for their metabolic needs .,"Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) absorbs inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through an active transport process mediated by the nine members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) family. These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response. Such reactions have been uncoupled from PHT1 activity, suggesting that systemic Pi sensing is most probably acting downstream of PHT1."

This not only raises operational costs but also contributes to higher CO2 emissions .","Road network requires timely maintenance to keep pavement surface in good condition for reduction of fuel consumption with the limited budget. This study focused on development of pavement preservation strategies in the road network considering multi-objective optimization of agency cost and environmental impact (in terms of CO<inf>2</inf> emission). Field data from long-term pavment performance (LTPP) database were used to quantify the impact of pavement preservation treatments (crack seal, chip seal, and thin overlay) on the changes of surface roughness. The emission rate functions of vehicles with respect to speed and pavement surface condition were developed using Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) with the updated tire rolling resistance coefficients. The multi-objective optimization problem was solved using the Simulated Constraint Boundary Model (SCBM) method. The final solution was recommended based on the minimized distance from the utopia point to the Pareto front. The results show that the optimization solutions are affected by the available budget, existing pavement condition, truck traffic, and unacceptable level of pavement roughness. For multi-objective optimization of minimizing both agency cost and CO<inf>2</inf> emission, the recommended preservation treatments among different segments is a combination of crack seal and thin overlay in most cases. These findings can be used by highway agencies to make road maintenance decisions considering the tradeoff between agency cost and environmental impact."
s_1870,"Key Techniques for Reducing UHI in Tropical Regions: The size and shape of green open spaces can influence their effectiveness in reducing UHI. Larger and more densely vegetated areas tend to have a higher cooling effect. For example, densely vegetated areas in a hot-arid climate showed a cooling effect of up to 3.5 °C during the day .","The microclimate and air quality in urban spaces are of a great interest for the well-being of citizens. Mitigating urban heat island is a major concern for human health by improving comfort especially in desert regions. While the thermal comfort is relatively easy to obtain in indoor spaces, it is more difficult to provide in outdoor ones. It is often sought by passive means. Vegetation could play an important role in ameliorating urban microclimates. It should be used judiciously in urban planning and designing outdoor spaces. The objective of this work is to explore the influence of green cover during summer on microclimate in the region of Ben-Isguen, a city of a hot-arid climate in the M'zab valley, Ghardaïa (Algeria). Many studies have proved that vegetation can produce a cooling effect of 2 to 3 °C on average. Gardens and urban parks in particular, in and around cities contribute to alleviating heat stress by creating the so-called ""oasis effect"" through public spaces. They improve thermal comfort and reduce cooling energy consumption. The microclimate of different locations, in both green and built-up areas (old town, palm grove, etc.) was characterized with the help of field measurements carried out during summer days. The results confirmed the presence of an important cooling effect of vegetation (PCI). It was shown that it is essentially a nocturnal phenomenon by displaying a maximum value of 10 °C. This result is very important regarding the results of similar studies. The research demonstrated that the oasis effect is best developed around dawn in calm and clear sky conditions. Maximum daytime cooling effect of the green cover was 4.5 °C in reference to old town. Nevertheless this effect showed fluctuation so that it displayed negative values by moments. The cooling effect of the palm grove is due to shade foliage, evapotranspiration, low heat capacity of vegetation and high aerodynamic roughness. In fact the oasis acts as a ""heat sink"". The old town of Ben-Isguen presented a diurnal heat island and a nocturnal cool island with maximum intensity of 3.5 °C and 4 °C respectively. The investigation of the oasis microclimate revealed that densely vegetated areas display higher cooling effect. The latter varied among different areas due to shade conditions, density of vegetation, sky view factor (SVF), soil characteristics and water surface availability. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd."

It is calculated based on soil profiles and standard penetration tests (SPT) data, considering factors like groundwater depth and peak ground acceleration .","The liquefaction potential index (LPI) has been applied with increasing frequency to assess the potential for liquefaction-induced ground failures. This paper describes strategies used to re-calibrate the LPI using accepted methods for screening the liquefaction potential and evaluates its application to the seismic hazard mapping of political tracts. In this study soil profiles using standard penetration tests were evaluated using two methods, the Chinese criteria and the Bray-Sancio criteria. The LPI values were then calculated from these profiles at non-liquefied and liquefied sites in Nagaoka City during the 2004 Niigata-ken Chuetsu earthquake in Japan. Our results suggest that 50% of the liquefied sites exhibited LPI values >. 15, and 75% of the non-liquefied sites exhibited LPI values <. 11 when applying the Chinese criteria. For the Bray-Sancio criteria, 50% of the liquefied sites and 75% of the non-liquefied sites exhibited LPI values >. 21 and <. 14, respectively. We then attempted to map liquefaction hazards using the alternative LPI thresholds (low hazard if LPI. <. 14; moderate if 14. ≤. LPI. <. 21; high if 21. ≤. LPI) and applied regression analyses between the LPI and the controlling variables (i.e., groundwater depth and peak ground acceleration).

[2]: In this paper an improved method for evaluation of liquefaction hazard is presented. The liquefaction potential index developed by Iwasaki and his co-workers is modified using the concept of probability. The modified liquefaction potential index is then calibrated with field observation data, which yields an empirical equation for the probability of liquefaction-induced ground failure. The method and procedure is then employed to study the ground shaking level of the 1886 Charleston, South Carolina earthquake based on an analysis of liquefaction hazard in the Charleston peninsula. The results show that the ground shaking level of the 1886 event may be represented with moment magnitude M<inf>w</inf> = 6.9 and peak ground surface acceleration a<inf>max</inf> = 0.2 g.

i_1797,"Quantitative and Qualitative Metrics: Quantitative Metrics: Metrics that provide numerical data on resource efficiency, circularity, and environmental impacts .","Current Circular Economy (CE) frameworks applied to product chains exhibit notable shortcomings. These include neglecting the resilience and robustness of design, requiring detailed economic and environmental data for impact assessment, and relying on qualitative rather than quantitative metrics capturing certain CE design aspects. In the current contribution, we addressed these shortcomings by developing an Ecologically inspired (Eco-inspired) Framework using the mathematical foundations of Ecological Network Analysis (ENA). While ENA metrics have previously found application in designing circular economies, particularly in Industrial Symbiosis (IS) networks, our adaptation tailors these metrics for use in product-level CE, recognizing the inherent distinctions between product-level CE and IS. Our Eco-inspired Framework comprises three key categories to provide holistic and granular-level metrics for designing product-level CE. The first set of metrics assesses circularity and resource efficiency. The second set gauges network intensity and robustness as complementary indicators ensuring a CE is both sustainable and resilient. The third group of metrics evaluates enhancement potential of CE strategies through introducing quantitative metrics for measuring the degree of closed-loop strategies and average circularity level of a CE design. The three comprehensive set of indicators within the Eco-inspired Framework uniquely captures various facets of circular design, whether originating from technological innovations and recovery improvement at the end of life (EoL), shifts in human consumption patterns, alterations in product design, or changes in business models. The framework's application is tested in designing a CE for multilayer Polyethylene-Polyamide (PE-PA) films. Using the Eco-inspired Framework, we identified the best strategy for designing a resilient and sustainable CE for PE-PA films. A diverse set of EoL strategies along with a reduction in product consumption can improve circularity and resilience by 650% and 255%, respectively, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions by 90%. The framework minimizes trade-offs between sustainability and circularity goals and offers insights on how to enhance each strategy for achieving a resilient and sustainable CE for products.
[7]: Understanding how a circular economy (CE) can reduce environmental pressures from economic activities is crucial for policy and practice. Science provides a range of indicators to monitor and assess CE activities. However, common CE activities, such as recycling and eco-design, are contested in terms of their contribution to environmental sustainability. This article assesses whether and to what extent current approaches to assess CE activities sufficiently capture environmental pressures to monitor progress toward environmental sustainability. Based on a material flow perspective, we show that most indicators do not capture environmental pressures related to the CE activities they address. Many focus on a single CE activity or process, which does not necessarily contribute to increased environmental sustainability overall. Based on these results, we suggest complementing CE management indicators with indicators capturing basic environmental pressures related to the respective CE activity. Given the conceptual linkage between CE activities, resource extraction, and waste flows, we suggest that a resource-based footprint approach accounting for major environmental inputs and outputs is necessary—while not sufficient—to assess the environmental sustainability of CE activities. As footprint approaches can be used across scales, they could aid the challenging process of developing indicators for monitoring progress toward an environmentally sustainable CE at the European, national, and company levels."

These variations were magnified, analyzed and detected at a distance of 2.5 m from the subject. A modified motion magnification system and frame subtraction technique were used to identify breathing movements by detecting rapid motion areas in the magnified frame sequences. The experimental results on a set of video data from five subjects (3 h for each subject) showed that our monitoring system can accurately measure respiratory rate and therefore detect apnoea in infants and young children.

The features are trained over five baseline classifiers namely, the Naïve Bayesian, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, multilayer perceptron and decision tree. The results validate that the population-based meta-heuristic algorithms for feature subset selection outperform the baseline supervised learning algorithms. For the binary grey wolf algorithm, an average improvement of 9.4% in accuracy is observed with an approximate 20.5% average reduction in features. Also, for the binary moth flame algorithm, an average accuracy improvement of 10.6% is observed with an approximate 40% average reduction in features. The highest accuracy of 76.5% is observed for support vector machine with binary grey wolf optimizer on SemEval 2016 benchmark dataset. [3] Recent research has shown that Particle Swarm Optimisation is a promising approach to feature selection. However, applying it on high-dimensional data with thousands to tens of thousands of features is still challenging because of the large search space. While filter approaches are time efficient and scalable for high-dimensional data, they usually obtain lower classification accuracy than wrapper approaches. On the other hand, wrapper methods require a longer running time than filter methods due to the learning algorithm involved in fitness evaluation. This paper proposes a new strategy of combining filter and wrapper approaches in a single evolutionary process in order to achieve smaller feature subsets with better classification performance in a shorter time. A new local search heuristic using symmetric uncertainty is proposed to refine the solutions found by PSO and a new hybrid fitness function is used to better evaluate candidate solutions. The proposed method is examined and compared with three recent PSO based methods on eight high-dimensional problems of varying difficulty. The results show that the new hybrid PSO is more effective and efficient than the other methods."
s_980,Key Findings from Related Studies: Collagen and Dermal Matrix: Freeze-dried collagen combined with micronized allogenic dermis showed increased wound tissue revascularization and proliferation in diabetic wounds .,"The incidence and prevalence of chronic and diabetic wounds are increasing and clinical treatments to tackle these epidemics are still insufficient. In this study, we tested the ability of freeze-dried platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and an allogenic micronized acellular dermal matrix alone and in combination to modulate diabetic wound healing. Therapeutic materials were applied to 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> excisional wounds on genetically diabetic (db/db) mice. Wound-healing kinetics and new tissue formation were studied at 9 and 21 days posttreatment. Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to study vascularity and cellular proliferation (days 9 and 21), and collagen deposition was evaluated 21 days postwounding. In vitro, micronized allogenic dermis, when combined with PRP, absorbed nearly 50% of original platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, vascular endothelial growth factor, and epidermal growth factor from platelets and stimulated fibroblast proliferation. In vivo, micronized dermis increased the formation of vascularized wound tissue by day 9. Freeze-dried PRP alone or in combination with micronized dermis increased wound tissue revascularization and proliferation compared with spontaneous healing. The increase in cell proliferation persisted until day 21 only when freeze-dried PRP was used in combination with micronized dermis. These results indicate that micronized allogenic dermis may be used to provide a dermal matrix to stimulate tissue formation and the combination with PRP may confer additional beneficial growth factors to chronic or diabetic wounds. © 2008 by the Wound Healing Society."
s_1410,"Challenges: Species Decline: Many bumblebee species are in decline, which may complicate field identification due to reduced populations .","Bees pollinate most of the world's wild plant species and provide economically valuable pollination services to crops; yet knowledge of bee conservation biology lags far behind other taxa such as vertebrates and plants. There are few long-term data on bee populations, which makes their conservation status difficult to assess. The best-studied groups are the genus Bombus (the bumble bees), and bees in the EU generally; both of these are clearly declining. However, it is not known to what extent these groups represent the approximately 20,000 species of bees globally. As is the case for insects in general, bees are underrepresented in conservation planning and protection efforts. For example, only two bee species are on the global IUCN Red List, and no bee is listed under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, even though many bee species are known to be in steep decline or possibly extinct. At present, bee restoration occurs mainly in agricultural contexts, funded by government programs such as agri-environment schemes (EU) and the Farm Bill (USA). This is a promising approach given that many bee species can use human-disturbed habitats, and bees provide valuable pollination services to crops. However, agricultural restorations only benefit species that persist in agricultural landscapes, and they are more expensive than preserving natural habitat elsewhere. Furthermore, such restorations benefit bees in only about half of studied cases. More research is greatly needed in many areas of bee conservation, including basic population biology, bee restoration in nonagricultural contexts, and the identification of disturbance-sensitive bee species. © 2010 New York Academy of Sciences.
[6]: Many bumblebee (Bombus) species are thought to have declined in abundance in the last 50 years, while a small number of species remain abundant. Here we examine which factors render some British bumblebee species more susceptible to environmental change than others. We present forage data on workers of 15 bumblebee species gathered from 172 one hour searches conducted at sites in southern UK, the Hebrides (western Scotland) and in New Zealand (to which UK bumblebees were introduced). We also review data on distribution, phenology and tongue length of these species. Overall, Fabaceae appear to be the major pollen source for most bumblebee species. In particular, long-tongued, late emerging species such as Bombus ruderatus, Bombus humilis and Bombus subterraneus specialize heavily in gathering pollen from Fabaceae, and this group of bumblebee species have all declined. Some of them are also at the edge of their geographic range in the UK, which may have rendered them more sensitive to environmental change. The decline of many bumblebee species is probably attributable largely to the loss of unimproved flower-rich grasslands, a habitat rich in Fabaceae. The bumblebee species that remain abundant are mostly short-tongued species that emerge early in the season and have less specialized diets; these species are very common in suburban gardens where they are able to exploit the broad range of floral resources. A third group of bumblebees are strongly associated with Ericaceae in moorland and heathland habitats, and have probably always had restricted distributions. A small number of species are not so easily categorised. Bombus soroeensis and B. ruderarius are not dietary specialists, nor are they close to the limit of their geographic range, but nevertheless they have declined. Much of the ecology of rare bumblebee species remains poorly understood and in need of further study. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

Technologies such as synthetic aperture radar, hyperspectral imaging, and thermal IR imaging are being evaluated to enhance sensor performance under poor visibility .","Ice remote sensing is a critical element of ice management for oil and gas operations in Arctic waters. Both strategic and tactical decisions related to drilling and production operations are significantly influenced by the ice detection capabilities. Common ship borne remote sensing systems today include marine radars, optical and thermal infrared sensors. However, a range of adverse environmental factors can dramatically reduce the performance of these systems. Fog, haze, strong wind, snow and rain, waves, along with the Arctic winter nights can create challenging operating conditions. Particularly the detection of relatively small icebergs (namely growlers and bergy bits) in harsh weather conditions often arises as a hazard for marine operations. Remote sensing technology is developing continuously. Several techniques aimed at enhancing sensor performance under poor visibility or in darkness do exist today. Active illumination for example, can be used to compensate for lacking of sufficient external light. This paper presents a review of the current and emerging remote sensing technologies that can be applied for growlers and bergy bits detection under harsh Arctic weather conditions. The frequency range of the ice sensors studied covers parts of the electro-magnetic (EM) spectrum, which include visible light (0.38 to 0.7 μm) and infrared (IR) (0.75 μm to 15μm). Sensing technologies such as LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), hyperspectral imaging, and thermal IR image are evaluated. Promising enhancing techniques as active illumination and range-gate imaging are discussed."

Demands for food and labor are rising at an exponential rate, outpacing the capabilities of conventional farming practices. A new age of revolutionary change has been caused by the incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into agriculture. This study focuses on the development of an AI-powered Chatbot that is customized for the agricultural sector, offering assistance with crop recommendation and disease detection. The two machine learning models used to handle crop suggestions are Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Using the VGG-16 transfer learning model, disease predictions are made. The models are evaluated thoroughly, and as a result, GNB and VGG-16 are chosen to be a part of the Chatbot's architecture. Without the need for professional knowledge, the Chatbot can help farmers select crops that are suited for cultivation and evaluate the health of their crops. The designed Chatbot is confirmed to be reliable and effective after extensive testing of its performance through various queries. By utilizing AI, we made a smart tool for effective crop management and harvesting."

Reviving Traditional Practices with Modern Innovations: Syntropic Agriculture: This method integrates scientific and traditional knowledge, promoting ecosystem regeneration and productivity. It is gaining traction in Brazil and other countries as a sustainable farming practice .","[5] Sustainable intensification is a process by which agricultural productivity is enhanced whilst also creating environmental and social benefits. We aimed to identify practices likely to deliver sustainable intensification, currently available for UK farms but not yet widely adopted. We compiled a list of 18 farm management practices with the greatest potential to deliver sustainable intensification in the UK, following a well-developed stepwise methodology for identifying priority solutions, using a group decision-making technique with key agricultural experts. The list of priority management practices can provide the focal point of efforts to achieve sustainable intensification of agriculture, as the UK develops post-Brexit agricultural policy, and pursues the second Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to end hunger and promote sustainable agriculture. The practices largely reflect a technological, production-focused view of sustainable intensification, including for example, precision farming and animal health diagnostics, with less emphasis on the social and environmental aspects of sustainability. However, they do reflect an integrated approach to farming, covering many different aspects, from business organization and planning, to soil and crop management, to landscape and nature conservation. For a subset of 10 of the priority practices, we gathered data on the level of existing uptake in English and Welsh farms through a stratified survey in seven focal regions. We find substantial existing uptake of most of the priority practices, indicating that UK farming is an innovative sector. The data identify two specific practices for which uptake is relatively low, but which some UK farmers find appealing and would consider adopting. These practices are: prediction of pest and disease outbreaks, especially for livestock farms; staff training on environmental issues, especially on arable farms. [15] As much the policies of rural development, nature conservation or land menagement, as the practices of die cattle raising, the industry or the tourism in the countryside, seem to want today to advance in the sustainable development way. The article seeks to investigate on the true reach of the sustainability in this policies and practical rural in the Cantabrian region. [16] Agricultural technology has increased farm production to unprecedented levels. However, return on investment is diminishing and environmental concerns conflict with current input intensive farm practices. Conventional technologies and their application such as crop breeding and management practices have focused on monocultural systems that are dependent on chemical inputs to produce optimum yields. Current profit margins are low or non-existent with these conventional non-sustainable practices and must be changed if the family farm is to survive. We propose an ecologically based approach to farm management that strives to reduce reliance on chemically intensive inputs through better use of multiple attributes inherent within agroecosystems. This approach requires a redirection in the development and application of current and emerging technologies. Examples of redirections in research and development programs for pest management practices, genetic engineering, and precision agriculture necessary to provide a more ecologically-based and sustainable farming approach are illustrated. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."

However, the historical view of Windows as a high-overhead, low-stability operating system has tended to limit the number of Windows-based mission-critical automation systems relative to the more conventional embedded micro-controller or Linux-based approaches. This paper documents the use of the Windows operating system for mission critical control of an active denial security technology. The advantages offered by Windows are weighed alongside the risks. We examine specific technical risks to long-term application stability including memory leaks, page faults and stack pointer corruptions. The risks and benefits of using third-party software libraries to accelerate the development and implementation of control systems are evaluated. The trend towards the use of managed versus native code is examined along with its associated impact on application stability and testing methods. Specific counter-measures aimed at reducing the incidence of operating system instability and application fault are discussed including the use of memory analyzers, inter-locking application threads, state-based persistence recovery objects and watchdog timers. We detail some techniques for effectively employing these countermeasures toward the production of highly stable Windows-based control systems.

Improved Clinical Outcomes: While regular automated red cell exchange transfusions may reduce the frequency and severity of painful crises for some patients, it is likely that the overall impact on emergency hospital visits and hospital stays is minimal, as not all patients experience these benefits equally .","Red cell transfusion represents one of the cornerstones of the chronic management of sickle cell disease, as well as its acute complications. Automated red cell exchange can rapidly lower the number of circulating sickle erythrocytes, without causing iron overload. Here, we describe our experience, having offered this intervention since 2011. A transient reduction in the platelet count by 61% was observed after the procedure. This was not associated with any haemorrhagic complications. Despite exposure to large volumes of blood, the alloimmunisation rate was only 0.027/100 units of red cells. The absence of any iron loading was confirmed by serial Ferriscans, performed over a number of years. However, patients with advanced chronic kidney disease showed evidence of iron loading due to reduced innate haemopoiesis and were subsequently switched to simple transfusions. A total of 59% of patients were on regular automated red cell exchange with a history of recurrent painful crises. A total of 77% responded clinically, as evidenced by at least a 25% reduction in their emergency hospital attendance for pain management. The clinical response was gradual and increased the longer patients stayed on the program. The earliest sign of clinical response was a reduction in the length of stay when these patients were hospitalised, indicating that a reduction in the severity of crises precedes the reduction in their frequency. Automated red cell exchange also appeared to be beneficial for patients with recurrent leg ulcers and severe, drug resistant stuttering priapism, while patients with pulmonary hypertension showed a dramatic improvement in their symptoms as well as echocardiographic parameters."

i_1813,"5. ** Agricultural Practices: ** Agricultural intensification and the presence of mass-flowering crops can alter local plant-pollinator networks, affecting bee populations. It is likely that mass-flowering crops significantly reduce parasite transmission among bees, as they provide abundant floral resources for a short period, which may be the sole reason for the observed decline in parasite prevalence .","Parasites influence wild bee population dynamics and are regarded as one of the main drivers of wild bee decline. Most of these parasites are mainly transmitted between bee species via the use of shared floral resources. Disturbance of the plant-pollinator network at a location can hence disturb the transmission of these parasites. Expansion and intensification of agriculture, another major driver of wild bee decline, often disturbs local plant-pollinator networks by altering the availability and diversity of floral resources. Mass-flowering crops are an extreme example as they provide an abundance of floral resources for a short period of time, substantially altering the present plant-pollinator network. This likely has repercussions on parasite transmission in the pollinator community. Using the bloom of mass-flowering crops we tested the hypothesis that an increase in floral resources can dilute parasite transmission in the pollinator community. To test this, we analysed the presence of parasites in the pollen of the brood cell provisions of Osmia spp., collected from trap nests placed in apple and sweet cherry orchards. We collected pollen at several time intervals during and after mass bloom, and found that pollen collected during mass bloom had significantly lower parasite prevalence compared with pollen collected after mass bloom. Furthermore, using pollen barcoding data we found that the presence of MFCs in pollen was a good predictor for lower parasite prevalence. Taken together, our results indicate that an increase in flower availability can reduce parasite transmission between bees."
i_1742,"Key Factors Affecting NDVI During the Dry Season: Physiological Responses to Water Deficit: Water deficit conditions reduce nitrogen uptake and alter nitrogen allocation within plants, which can affect their overall health and greenness. This physiological stress contributes to the reduction in NDVI during dry periods .","Earlier studies showed that water deficit reduces nitrogen (N) uptake and N nutrition index of grasses. So far, the main effect of water deficit on N uptake and N nutrition status was ascribed to the alteration of the transpiration-dependent transport of mineral N in the soil solution. A split-root experiment was performed to determine whether plant and/or solution water potential could alter N uptake and allocation, independently of N fluxes in the soil solution. The split-root experiment allowed to manipulate separately the water and the N status of the root environment and of the plant, by various combinations of addition of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG) and mineral N on half or on the entire root system. Tall fescue, Italian ryegrass and cocksfoot, known for their contrasted sensitivities to water deficit, were studied. The addition of PEG largely reduced water and N uptake of the roots on which it was applied (half or entire root system). A significant accumulation of N was observed on the roots to which PEG was added, particularly in cocksfoot and tall fescue, hypothetically contributing to the alteration of N uptake. Cocksfoot displayed a high plasticity in N allocation to leaves related to sheaths, allowing the maintenance of N concentration and therefore its N status despite the reduction in N uptake. By contrast, leaf N concentration and N status of tall fescue and Italian ryegrass was more sensitive to water deficit, similarly to observations of the effect of drought in field studies. Therefore, it is concluded that the effect of soil solution potential on N uptake and plant N allocation may also contribute to the observed effect of drought on N status of grass crops, additionally to the effect of drought on the transfer of mineral N in the soil solution to the root surface. However, the importance of this physiological effect varies among species. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."

The resulted displaced and encroached habitat in need of recuperation demands a comprehensive overhaul to the customary urban planning practices; further, the deteriorating public health state of urban residents calls for strategies in dealing with green deprivation and gentrification issues. Frequently, urban greening strategies are envisaged at a macro-scale on a dedicated horizontal track of land, rendering local implementation in a densely built neighborhood a challenged undertaking. Communities lacking green and land resources could promote vertical greening to enable and enhance social and psychological well-being. This study ascertains that vertical greenery closest to the inhabitants could be allocated on a building facade. It can contribute to a more sustainable ecology. The article presents the systemic design approach to urban vertical greening thinking and its role in well-being provision. We propose an interdisciplinary multicriteria contextual-based scalable framework to assess vertical green infrastructure; the prototype requires an innovative approach to balance architecture, human needs, and the local environment. The vertical greening application provides an alternative paradigm in the design implementation for urban green. We proposed the locality and place to be incorporated into the vertical greening design framework. The research concludes the three-tiered consideration framework resulted: (1) in line with the human-habitat ecosystem, the local environment-social dimension is explored; (2) the well-being criteria encourage the design practice's support for localized driven community vitality; (3) the design paradigm requires integration with the increasing demand for green space as well as taking into account the impact of severe climate; and (4) the framework should achieve the strengthening of health and well-being of the community."

It is administered concurrently with the antibiotic imipenem to prevent its renal metabolism to therapeutically inactive and potentially nephrotoxic products. Cilastatin increases the concentration of imipenem in urine and protects against nephrotoxicity. Cilastatin itself has no antibacterial activity .... © 2007 Elsevier Inc.
[2]: Background: The very broad spectrum antibiotic imipenem is resistant to typical ß-lactamases (penicillinases and cephalosporinases). Imipenem is currently combined with the dipeptidase inhibitor cilastatin to increase the plasma concentration of imipenem and to prolong its blood half-life. Since all antibiotics can modulate the oxidative metabolism of human phagocytes, the clinician should know if a certain drug weakens the main cells against invasive bacteria or fungi. Therefore the blood ROS generation assay (BRGA) was performed that analyzes the reactive oxygen species - generating capacity of blood neutrophils in presence of high concentrations of imipenem/cilastatin that can be found at the infusion/blood interface. Material and Methods: 40μl 0-2564mg/l imipenem/cilastatin in black high quality polystyrene microtiter plates (Brand®781608) and 125μl Hankś Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) were incubated in duplicate with 10μl fresh or 1d old citrated blood of 6 healthy donors, 10μl 5mM luminol, and 10μl zymosan A in 0.9% NaCl (final conc. 1.9μg/ml). During the main incubation (37<sup>o</sup>C) the light emissions of the wells were measured by a photons-multiplying microtiter plate luminometer (LUmo) with an integration time of 0.5s/well. The approximative 50% inhibitory (approx. IC50) or the approx. 200% stimulatory (approx. SC200) concentrations of imipenem/cilastatin were determined. Results and Discussion: Imipenem/cilastatin inhibited blood ROS generation in the BRGA at approx. IC50 of 60±41mg/l (MV±1SD). Thus, imipenem/cilastatin might dangerously decrease blood ROS generation, especially at high concentrations. If cilastatin significantly modulates blood ROS generation, it is suggested to avoid it.Cilastatin might not only inhibit the neutrophilś action against bacteria and fungi, cilastatin might also decrease cellular fibrinolysis. © 2013 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Methods: Barriers to provision of DSMT at the point of care and strategies to overcome such challenges are discussed. In addition, new avenues to support continuing diabetes education are presented. Results: Diabetes is a complex disease that requires education, monitoring, and medication adjustment to achieve treatment goals. Unfortunately, adequate support is seldom available for the increased time and effort needed for optimal management of diabetes. Health-care delivery systems are designed to provide a response to acute illnesses and are poorly configured to meet the needs of patients with complex chronic illnesses. Although team care and DSMT have proved to be effective, they have infrequently been integrated in primary care offices, where most patients with diabetes receive treatment. It is encouraging that the studies conducted to date have generally found office-based counseling and educational strategies to be effective for the vast majority of patients with diabetes. Community-based programs that extend DSMT have also been successful. Conclusion: Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires providers to deliver multifaceted care and patients to be proficient in many self-care skills. Team care and DSMT approaches have been found to yield beneficial results, yet such strategies are seldom used in the primary care office. Thus, models that support the team approach to delivery of diabetes care and self-management education interventions should be explored and encouraged. © 2006 AACE."

Here, we present data on an alternative bactericidal agent, copper oxide nanoparticles (CuONPs), and its efficacy on Legionella pneumophila. In broth cultures, the CuO-NPs caused growth inhibition, which appeared to be concentration and exposure time dependent. The transcriptomic response of L. pneumophila to CuO-NP exposure was investigated by using a whole-genome microarray. The expression of genes involved in metabolism, transcription, translation, DNA replication and repair, and unknown/hypothetical proteins was significantly affected by exposure to CuO-NPs. In addition, expression of 21 virulence genes was also affected by exposure to CuO-NP and further evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Some virulence gene responses occurred immediately and transiently after addition of CuO-NPs to the cells and faded rapidly (icmV, icmW, lepA), while expression of other genes increased within 6 h (ceg29, legLC8, legP, lem19, lem24, lpg1689, and rtxA), 12 h (cegC1, dotA, enhC, htpX, icmE, pvcA, and sidF), and 24 h (legP, lem19, and ceg19), but for most of the genes tested, expression was reduced after 24 h of exposure.

Sponges exhibit resilience to environmental stressors such as sedimentation, but their mechanisms to reject and clear sediments may not be effective under all conditions. While they can survive high sediment deposition, this does not guarantee their health is maintained, as some species may still experience negative impacts that could affect ecosystem stability in changing environmental conditions .","One of the ways dredging can affect benthic habitats is through high levels of sediment deposition, which has the potential to smother sessile organisms such as sponges. In order to provide pressure-response values to sedimentation and tease apart the different cause-effect pathways of high turbidity, 5 sponge species, including heterotrophic and phototrophic nutritional modes, were exposed for up to 30 d to multiple sediment deposition events, each of which resulted in an initial covering of 80-100% of the surface of the sponges in a layer ~0.5 mm thick. The response of the sponges was examined using a suite of different response variables including growth, respiration, lipid content, community composition of the microbial symbionts, and maximum quantum yield and chlorophyll content of the phototrophic symbionts. Different species showed different mechanisms of sediment rejection and different patterns of sediment clearance. All species survived the treatments, were able to tolerate high levels of partial covering of their surfaces, and for most species the treatment did not alter the health of the sponge holobiont. Results from this study will guide interpretation of experiments examining the combined effects of all three dredging-related pressures, and aid the development of water quality thresholds for impact prediction purposes."
s_12,2. Integration with AI Applications: Tightly Integrated Systems: Integrate predictive models and rules within the same reasoning framework. This can be achieved by encoding models using standards like PMML (Predictive Model Markup Language) and processing them with Apache Spark .,"In this paper we describe how the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard enhances the JBoss Drools production rule engine with native support for using predictive models in business rules. The historic debate between symbolic and connectionist approaches to rule/model orchestration provides numerous examples of hybrid systems combining ""hard"" and ""soft"" computing techniques to achieve di-erent levels of integration. Rules are often used to decide when and which model to invoke; model outputs, in turn, can be used to evaluate the preconditions of a rule. In a loosely coupled system, the rule engine calls an external component implementing the predictive model, but this has several disadvantages, most notably the need to setup proper communications and reconcile any di-erence in the way the components encode the data. We propose instead, a tightly integrated system where predictive models and rules become part of the same reasoning framework. The models, encoded using the PMML 4 standard, are loaded and processed by a compiler implemented using the rule engine it-self. The PMML document is transformed into a set of facts that de-ne the model, and a series of rules that formalize the model's behavior. In addition, most PMML data processing, validation, and transformation procedures are also implemented using auto-generated rules. Finally, in oder to integrate model inputs and outputs seamlessly in the inference process, we exploit an extension of the Drools engine which adds native support for uncertainty and/or fuzziness.

Evidence: Chitosan-coated scaffolds showed better MSC adhesion and improved mucosal regeneration in a rabbit model compared to non-coated scaffolds .,"BACKGROUND:: Long segmental tracheal repair is challenging in regenerative medicine due to low adhesion of stem cells to tracheal scaffolds. Optimal transplantation of stem cells for tracheal defects has not been established. We evaluated the role of hyaluronic acid (HA) coating of tracheal scaffolds in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adhesion and tracheal regeneration in a rabbit model. METHODS:: A three-dimensionally printed tubular tracheal prosthesis was incubated with dopa-HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 days. MSCs were incubated with an HA-coated scaffold, and their adhesion was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. HA coated scaffolds with or without MSC seeding were transplanted at the circumferential tracheal defect in rabbits, and survival, rigid bronchoscopy, radiologic findings, and histologic findings were compared between the two groups. RESULTS:: HA-coated scaffolds showed better MSC adhesion than non-coated scaffolds. The HA-coated scaffolds with MSC group showed a wider airway and greater mucosal regeneration compared to the HA-coated scaffolds without MSC group. CONCLUSION:: HA coating of scaffolds can promote MSC adhesion and tracheal regeneration."
s_2075,"Negative Impacts: Biodiversity Loss: The presence of cattle can negatively affect the biodiversity of the paramo. Grazing can lead to a decrease in plant species richness and alter the composition of plant communities, potentially displacing native species and reducing habitat quality for wildlife .","The far-reaching impacts of livestock grazing in terrestrial grasslands are widely appreciated, but how livestock affect the structure and functions of sensitive coastal ecosystems has hitherto lacked synthesis. Grazing-induced changes in salt marshes have the potential to alter the provision of valuable ecosystem services, such as coastal protection, blue carbon and biodiversity conservation. To investigate how livestock alter soil, vegetation and faunal properties in salt marshes, we conducted a global meta-analysis of ungulate grazer impacts on commonly measured ecosystem properties (498 individual responses from 89 studies). We also tested stocking density, grazing duration, grazer identity, continent and vegetation type as potential modifiers of the grazing effect. The majority of studies were conducted in Europe (75) or the Americas (12), and investigated cattle (43) or sheep (22) grazing. All measures of above-ground plant material (height, cover, above-ground biomass, litter) were decreased by grazing, potentially impairing coastal protection through diminished wave attenuation. Soil carbon was reduced by grazing in American, but not European marshes, indicating a trade-off with climate regulation that varies geographically. Additionally, grazing increased soil bulk density, salinity and daytime temperature, and reduced redox potential. Biodiversity responses depended on focal group, with positive effects of grazing on vegetation species richness, but negative effects on invertebrate richness. Grazing reduced the abundance of herbivorous invertebrates, which may affect fish and crustaceans that feed in the marsh. Overall vertebrate abundance was not affected, but there was provisional evidence for increases over a longer duration of grazing, potentially increasing birdwatching and wildfowling opportunities. Synthesis and applications. Our results reveal that the use of salt marshes for livestock production affects multiple ecosystem properties, creating trade-offs and synergies with other ecosystem services. Grazing leads to reductions in blue carbon in the Americas but not in Europe. Grazing may compromise coastal protection and the provision of a nursery habitat for fish while creating provisioning and cultural benefits through increased wildfowl abundance. These findings can inform salt marsh grazing management, based on local context and desired ecosystem services.
[4]: Tropical dry forests (TDF) are highly threatened ecosystems that are often fragmented due to land-cover change. Using plot inventories, we analyzed tree species diversity, community composition and aboveground biomass patterns across mature (MF) and secondary forests of about 25 years since cattle ranching ceased (SF), 10–20-year-old plantations (PL), and pastures in a TDF landscape in Ecuador. Tree diversity was highest in MF followed by SF, pastures and PL, but many endemic and endangered species occurred in both MF and SF, which demonstrates the importance of SF for species conservation. Stem density was higher in PL, followed by SF, MF and pastures. Community composition differed between MF and SF due to the presence of different specialist species. Some SF specialists also occurred in pastures, and all species found in pastures were also recorded in SF indicating a resemblance between these two land-cover types even after 25 years of succession. Aboveground biomass was highest in MF, but SF and Tectona grandis PL exhibited similar numbers followed by Schizolobium parahyba PL, Ochroma pyramidale PL and pastures. These findings indicate that although species-poor, some PL equal or surpass SF in aboveground biomass, which highlights the critical importance of incorporating biodiversity, among other ecosystem services, to carbon sequestration initiatives. This research contributes to understanding biodiversity conservation across a mosaic of land-cover types in a TDF landscape."
s_2082,"Microbial Contaminants: Cyanotoxins: Cyanobacteria can produce toxins that are harmful to human health, and while conventional water treatment methods may struggle with these toxins, they are still somewhat effective in certain cases, which could reduce the need for specialized treatment units .","Several types of cyanotoxins found in surface water bodies are recognized as having human health effects, whereas taste and odor affect the palatability of water and give rise to public complaints. Conventional water treatment unit operations may be effective in removing the cyanobacteria cells, but cyanotoxins and dissolved organics are not targeted for removal by them. Special treatment units need to be introduced to deal with these substances and attention paid to the process design as many operational issues may be encountered. We used a water supply project in the Eastern Province of Sri Lanka as a case study to investigate the performance of unit operations in water treatment plants for which the source is shallow surface water sources with high inflows of nutrients. The present case study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of prechlorination, activated carbon adsorption, dissolved air flotation (DAF), filtration and disinfection in removal of cyanotoxins, and taste and odor causing dissolved organic substances from the source water. Raw water quality was evaluated using algal concentration, algal toxin concentration, and chemical oxygen demand. To evaluate the efficacy of treatment operations, the sequence of initial unit operation was changed on each day as with prechlorination and with powdered activated carbon (PAC), with prechlorination and without PAC, without prechlorination and with PAC, and without prechlorination and without PAC. In addition, laboratory analysis was done to obtain adsorption isotherms using three types of different PAC. The primary findings of our study were that PAC was effective in removal of Microcystin and chemical oxygen demand (COD) but needs to be optimized by providing sufficient contact time, and prechlorination does not improve the performance, whereas postchlorination is effective in removing any traces of Microcystin left after PAC. © 2012 American Society of Civil Engineers.
[6]: Cyanobacteria are a major problem for the world wide water industry as they can produce metabolites toxic to humans in addition to taste and odour compounds that make drinking water aesthetically displeasing. Removal of cyanobacterial toxins from drinking water is important to avoid serious illness in consumers. This objective can be confidently achieved through the application of the multiple barrier approach to drinking water quality and safety. In this study the use of a multiple barrier approach incorporating coagulation, powdered activated carbon (PAC) and ultrafiltration (UF) was investigated for the removal of intracellular and extracellular cyanobacterial toxins from two naturally occurring blooms in South Australia. Also investigated was the impact of these treatments on the UF flux. In this multibarrier approach, coagulation was used to remove the cells and thus the intracellular toxin while PAC was used for extracellular toxin adsorption and finally the UF was used for floc, PAC and cell removal. Cyanobacterial cells were completely removed using the UF membrane alone and when used in conjunction with coagulation. Extracellular toxins were removed to varying degrees by PAC addition. UF flux deteriorated dramatically during a trial with a very high cell concentration; however, the flux was improved by coagulation and PAC addition. © 2011 Elsevier B.V."
i_1329,Key Dietary Factors: Body Mass Index (BMI): Obesity is a significant risk factor for HS. Higher BMI is associated with increased disease severity. Patients with a BMI ≥ 25 kg/m² had higher median Hidradenitis Suppurativa Scores (HSS) compared to those with lower BMI .,"Background Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a long-standing disease with abscess and often fistula formation, predominantly in the axillae and groins. The disease is difficult to treat and has a severe impact on quality of life. A clinically relevant system for scoring disease severity is lacking in HS. Objectives To evaluate the modified Hidradenitis Suppurativa Score (HSS) and to study the impact of body mass index (BMI) and smoking habits on disease severity. Methods Two hundred and fifty-one consecutive patients with HS referred to a clinic with special interest in the disease were included, of whom 115 were scored. Points were given for regions involved, types of lesion (nodules, fistulas), total area involved and whether lesions were separated by normal skin. Background characteristics included BMI and smoking habits. Two hundred and forty-six patients completed the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Results The median (interquartile range, IQR) HSS for all patients was 38 (18-66): women 38 (18-71) and men 37 (19-51). Median (IQR) HSS for smokers was 41 (22-75·5), former smokers 27 (16-53) and nonsmokers 22 (10-57). Median (IQR) HSS for patients with BMI < 25 kg m<sup>-2</sup> was 32 (12-54), BMI 25-30 kg m<sup>-2</sup> 44 (22-56) and BMI ≥ 30 kg m<sup>-2</sup> 50 (18-86). Mean ± SD DLQI for the whole group of patients was 10·3 ± 7·5, median 9, and showed no significant differences between the groups studied. There was a significant positive correlation of fair degree between HSS and DLQI. There were significant differences in HSS between nonsmokers and smokers as well as between women of normal weight compared with obese women. Conclusions The modified HSS is simple and practical and it extracts important clinical information. A connection between disease severity and BMI as well as smoking habits in patients with HS is presented. The results suggest that the HSS may be a relevant outcome measure in future therapeutic trials in HS. © 2009 British Association of Dermatologists."

The cooperation among robots enhances their capabilities, and it is believed that future advancements in artificial intelligence will further improve the efficiency of these multi-robot systems in complex environments .","Formally, a collection of two or more autonomous mobile robots working together are termed as teams or societies of mobile robots. In multi robot systems simple robots are allowed to coordinate with each other to achieve some well defined goals. In these kinds of systems robots are far less capable as an entity, but the real power lies in cooperation of multiple robots. The simplicity of multi-robots have produced a potentially wide set of applications such as military missions (battlefield surveillance), searching for survivors in disaster hit areas, parallel and simultaneous transportation of vehicles, and delivery of payloads. Although the research on multi-robot systems has attracted considerable attention worldwide in the past decade, the research in this area is still in its infancy.

i_492,"Practical Implications of Agile Values: Enhanced Collaboration and Communication: Agile practices foster a collaborative environment where team members and stakeholders communicate frequently, leading to better decision-making and problem-solving .","Agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow better information systems development (ISD) performance. Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage.

[3]: Although agile software development is often associated with improved decision making, existing studies tend to focus on narrow aspects of decision making in such environments. There is a lack of clarity on how teams make and evaluate a myriad of decisions from software feature inception to product delivery and refinement. Indeed there is relatively little known about a) the decision characteristics related to agile values, and b) the challenges they present for decision making on agile teams. We present an in-depth exploratory case study based on a pluralistic approach comprising semi-structured interviews, focus groups, team meeting observations, and document analysis. The study identifies failings of decision making in an agile setting. Explicitly considering the decision process, information intelligence used in decision making, and decision quality, the key contribution of this paper is the development of an over-arching framework of agile decision making, which identifies particular decision characteristics across 4 key agile values and the related challenges for agile team decision making. It provides a framework for researchers and practitioners to evaluate the decision challenges of an agile software development team and to improve decision quality.
[8]: Agile software development processes (Agile), such as Scrum, DSDM, XP and Kanban, have become de facto standards for software development practice. Scrum, the most commonly used process, focuses on delivering functioning software early and continuously, and emphasizes speed, communication and developer collaboration in the software development process [15]. This workshop elicits practical and theoretical research regarding stakeholder involvement in Agile. This focus includes users, who have long been of interest in the HCI community, but also encompasses other stakeholders including customers, clients, managers, executives, business, funders and other specialists (legal, financial, political etc.), and other interested parties whose input is needed or sought during software development. The workshop is aimed at both academia and industry, where the experience from Agile and stakeholder involvement may vary along with people's backgrounds and areas of specialization or expertise."
i_1504,General Findings: Importance of Support: Detailed patient-provider discussions about emotional and social needs are associated with lower depressive symptoms and better psychological well-being .,"Background: A discussion about patient's nonmedical needs during treatment is considered a crucial component of high-quality patient–provider communication. We examined whether having a patient–provider discussion about cancer patients' emotional and social needs is associated with their psychological well-being. Methods: Using the 2016–2017 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey-Experiences with Cancer Survivorship Supplement (MEPS–ECSS) data, we identified the cancer survivors in the United States (US) who reported having a detailed discussion about emotional and social needs during cancer care. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess the association between having a patient–provider discussion and the patients' psychological well-being outcomes (depressive symptoms, severe psychological distress, and worrying about cancer recurrence/worsening condition) and benefit finding experience after a cancer diagnosis. Results: Among 1433 respondents (equivalent to 13.8 million cancer survivors in the US), only 33.6% reported having a detailed patient–provider discussion about their emotional and social needs. Having a discussion was associated with 55% lower odds (odds ratio [OR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.26–0.77) of having depressive symptoms and 97% higher odds (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.46–2.66) of having benefit finding experience. There was no statistically significant association between patient–provider discussion and psychological distress or worrying about cancer recurrence/worsening. Conclusion: Detailed patient–provider discussion about the cancer patients' emotional and social needs was associated with a lower likelihood of depressive symptoms and a higher likelihood of experiencing benefit finding. These findings stress the importance of improving the patient–provider discussion about psychosocial needs in cancer survivorship."
s_1413,"-  ** Transgenic Potato Lines**: Stable transgenic lines of potato expressing RNA interference (RNAi) constructs targeting nematode effector genes have shown significant resistance to M. chitwoodi. These transgenic potatoes exhibited a reduction in the number of nematode egg masses and eggs by up to 75% and 63%, respectively, compared to controls . This indicates that genetic engineering can be a viable method to develop nematode-resistant potato cultivars.","Meloidogyne chitwoodi, a quarantine pathogen, is a significant problem in potato-producing areas worldwide. In spite of considerable genetic diversity in wild potato species, no commercial potato cultivars with resistance to M. chitwoodi are available. Nematode effector genes are essential for the molecular interactions between root-knot nematodes and their hosts. Stable transgenic lines of Arabidopsis and potato (Solanum tuberosum) with resistance against M. chitwoodi were developed. RNA interference (RNAi) construct pART27(16D10i-2) was introduced into Arabidopsis thaliana and potato to express doublestranded RNA complementary to the putative M. chitwoodi effector gene Mc16D10L. Plant-mediated RNAi led to a significant level of resistance against M. chitwoodi in Arabidopsis and potato. In transgenic Arabidopsis lines, the number of M. chitwoodi egg masses and eggs was reduced by up to 57 and 67% compared with empty vector controls, respectively. Similarly, in stable transgenic lines of potato, the number of M. chitwoodi egg masses and eggs was reduced by up to 71 and 63% compared with empty vector controls, respectively. The relative transcript level of Mc16D10L was reduced by up to 76% in M. chitwoodi eggs and infective second-stage juveniles that developed on transgenic pART27(16D10i-2) potato, suggesting that the RNAi effect is systemic and heritable in M. chitwoodi."
i_703,Active Debris Removal (ADR): Harpoons and Nets: A European mission has tested the use of harpoons and nets to capture and remove space debris. This method aims to physically snare debris and remove it from orbit .,"A spacecraft may soon be able to snare space junk by firing harpoons and nets. A European mission was expected to begin tests in late May of space-age versions of those ancient tools to clean up Earth's cluttered orbital lanes. Space junk has already destroyed at least one satellite, damaged others, and periodically forces the crew aboard the International Space Station to take evasive action. There are more than half a million pieces of space debris larger than a marble and tens of thousands of significantly larger specimens left over from spent rocket boosters and defunct satellites. To head off future catastrophe, experts from NASA and the European Space Agency have proposed removing 5 to 10 large pieces of debris each year."
i_1727,"4. Seasonal and Spatial Variations: Seasonal changes also impact the relationship between DOC and CO₂. For instance, in Lake Chaohu, CO₂ concentrations were lower in the warm season compared to cooler seasons, indicating that temperature and biological activity (e.g. photosynthesis) play significant roles in CO₂ dynamics. Additionally, it is plausible that the introduction of specific aquatic plants during the warm season could further enhance the photosynthetic uptake of CO₂, although this has not been directly studied in Lake Chaohu .","In order to understand the temporal and spatial variation of carbon dioxide concentration (cCO<inf>2</inf>)and its influencing factors in the surface water of Lake Chaohu, the physicochemical parameters, biological parameters, and cCO<inf>2</inf> of surface (15-30 cm)water samples collected in February, April, August and November in 2017 from Lake Chaohu, representing different seasons, were measured. The surface water-air flux of CO<inf>2</inf> was then calculated based on gradient method as well. The results showed that the cCO<inf>2</inf> ranged from 13.31-55.47 μmol/L. The average annual cCO<inf>2</inf> was 26.27 μmol/L. The cCO<inf>2</inf> was higher in the west lake sub-lake zone than that in the central and east sub-lake zones. The surface water of Lake Chaohu had a lower cCO<inf>2</inf> in the warm season (summer) than in cool and cold seasons (spring, autumn and winter). cCO<inf>2</inf> was positively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC)concentration and negatively correlated with chlorophyll-a concentration, suggesting that photosynthesis and decomposition of organic matter plays an important role in the biochemical cycle of CO<inf>2</inf>. Due to the serious pollution of inflowing rivers surrounding Lake Chaohu, DOC input from the watershed supplied substrates for CO<inf>2</inf> production. Lake Chaohu was a relatively small source for atmosphere CO<inf>2</inf> compared to others studies. Lake Chaohu shifted from a CO<inf>2</inf> source to a sink in cold seasons."
s_1965,"Scalability and Efficiency: RF can handle large datasets efficiently, which is beneficial when working with extensive remote sensing data and large-scale ecological surveys .","Random forests as a promising ensemble learning algorithm have been increasingly used for remote sensor image classification, and are found to perform identical or better than some popular classifiers. With only two algorithmic parameters, they are relatively easier to implement. Existing literature suggests that the performance of random forests is insensitive to changing algorithmic parameters. However, this was largely based on the classifier's accuracy that does not necessarily represent the resulting thematic map accuracy. The current study extends beyond the classifier's accuracy assessment and investigate how the algorithmic parameters could affect the resulting thematic map accuracy by random forests. A set of random forest models with different parameter settings was carefully constructed and then used to classify a satellite image into multiple land cover categories. Both the classifier's accuracy and the map accuracy were assessed. The results reveal that these parameters can affect the map accuracy up to 9 ~ 16 percent for some classes, although their impact on the classifier's accuracy was quite limited. A careful parameterization prioritizing thematic map accuracy can help improve the performance of random forests in image classification, especially for spectrally complex land cover classes. These findings can help establish practical guidance on the use of random forests in the remote sensing community.
[9]: The random forest algorithm belongs to the class of ensemble learning methods that are embarassingly parallel, i.e., the learning task can be straightforwardly divided into subtasks that can be solved independently by concurrent processes. A parallel version of the random forest algorithm has been implemented in Erlang, a concurrent programming language originally developed for telecommunication applications. The implementation can be used for generating very large forests, or handling very large datasets, in a reasonable time frame. This allows for investigating potential gains in predictive performance from generating large-scale forests. An empirical investigation on 34 datasets from the UCI repository shows that forests of 1000 trees significantly outperform forests of 100 trees with respect to accuracy, area under ROC curve (AUC) and Brier score. However, increasing the forest sizes to 10 000 or 100 000 trees does not give any further significant performance gains. © 2011 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.
[10]: Impervious surfaces have important effects on the natural environment, including promoting hydrological run-off and impeding evapotranspiration, as well as increasing the urban heat island effect. Obtaining accurate and timely information on the spatial distribution and dynamics of urban surfaces is, thus, of paramount importance for socio-economic analysis, urban planning, and environmental modeling and management. Previous studies have indicated that the fusion of multi-source remotely sensed imagery can increase the accuracy of prediction for impervious surface information across large areas. However, the majority of them are limited to the use of specific data sources to construct a few features with which it can be challenging to characterize adequately the variation in impervious surfaces over large areas. Thus, impervious surface maps are often presented with high uncertainty. In response to this problem, we proposed the use of multi-temporal MODIS and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) nighttime light data to construct a more general and robust feature set for large-area artificial impervious surface percentage (AISP) prediction. Three fusion methods were proposed for application to multi-temporal MODIS surface reflectance product (MOD09A1) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (NPP-VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) data to construct three different types of features: spectral features, index features (band calculations), and fusion features. These features were then used as variables in a random-forest-based AISP prediction model. The model was fitted to China and then applied to predict AISP across Asia. Fifteen typical cities from different regions of Asia were selected to assess the accuracy of the prediction model. The use of multi-temporal MODIS and VIIRS DNB data was found to significantly increase the accuracy of prediction for large-area AISP. The feature set constructed in this research was demonstrated to be suitable for large-area AISP prediction, and the random forest model based on optimization of the selected features achieved the highest accuracy, amongst benchmarks, with testing R<sup>2</sup> of 0.690, and testing RMSE of 0.044 in 2018, respectively. In addition, to further test the performance of the proposed method, three existing impervious products (GAIA, HBASE, and NUACI) were used to compare quantitatively. The results showed that the predicted AISP achieved superior performance in comparison with others in some areas (e.g., arid areas and cloudy areas)."

Cost-Effectiveness: Reduced Operational Costs: Lower costs associated with printing, distributing, and managing paper ballots .","E-Voting has become a very controversially discussed topic during the last few years. Primarily caused by the fact of decreasing voter participation, some politicians regard e-voting as the magic bullet. Although IT experts and data privacy specialists disapprove of it, e-voting will be introduced during the upcoming Austrian Students' Union polls in early 2009. All advantages of e-voting, like an increased turnout of voters due to additional voting channels or cost reduction, have already been rebutted by a number of studies. Critics also strongly emphasize the disadvantages of electronic elections, such as violating the principles of electoral law as well as the loss of transparency of the voting process. © Springer-Verlag 2009.
[9]: Current electronic voting systems mostly relied on central server and the trusted third party, this kind system architecture increases the security risks of voting, and even makes voting fail. In order to solve this issue, an electronic voting system BFV-blockchainvoting that supported BFV homomorphic encryption was proposed, and this system applied the blockchain technology to the electronic voting system to replace the trusted third party. Firstly, an open and transparent bulletin board was used to record the vote information, and an intelligent contract was used to realize the functions of verification and self counting. Secondly, in order to further improve the security and reliability of the voting process, the voter's registration information was signed by SM2 signature algorithm, the ballot was managed by both parties that can supervise each other, and the counting data was encrypted by the BFV full homomorphic encryption algorithm. Finally, the evaluation of performance shows that it only costs 1.69 ms to complete one ballot in the proposed electronic voting system. This electronic voting scheme based on the BFV full homomorphic encryption and blockchain has better security attributes such as manipulation-resistance, anonymity, verifiability, double-voting resistance, coercion-resistance and resistance to quantum attacks. The scheme is suitable for a variety of voting scenarios and can meet the efficiency requirements in large voting scenarios."
s_1534,"Additional Insights: Genetic Redundancy: The PHT4 family consists of multiple members with overlapping functions, which can complicate the analysis of individual transporter roles. However, studies using gene silencing and multiple mutations have identified key transporters that contribute significantly to phosphate uptake and homeostasis .","Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) absorbs inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through an active transport process mediated by the nine members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) family. These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response. Such reactions have been uncoupled from PHT1 activity, suggesting that systemic Pi sensing is most probably acting downstream of PHT1."
i_869,"Tool Material: High-speed steel (HSS) drills are commonly used, but the use of diamond or carbide drill bits can also be effective, especially for maintaining tool longevity .","Composites are anisotropic materials, and long, continuous fiber laminates give the composite its strength. Drilling a hole disrupts this continuity and severely reduces the strength of the material. This project undertook a series of experiments to test whether a cross-ply orientation (laid up using 0°/90° alternating sheets of unidirectional fiber) or a woven fiber (laid up using balanced plain weave fabric) is stronger in open hole tension. Both carbon fiber and fiberglass were used in testing. A diamond tip drill bit and a carbide drill bit were used to determine whether any significant strength difference existed between using the two bits. It was found that there is a significant difference in open hole tensile strength and toughness between a woven fiber layup and a cross-ply layup, but there is no significant difference between using a diamond or carbide drill bit other than the longevity of the bit."

i_1812,"4. ** Fire Severity: ** Fire severity can also shape bee communities. High fire severity areas tend to have more diverse and abundant bee populations due to increased availability of flowering plants and nesting sites, and it is possible that these conditions may also enhance the overall resilience of the ecosystem to future wildfires .","As wildfire activity increases in many regions of the world, it is imperative that we understand how key components of fire-prone ecosystems respond to spatial variation in fire characteristics. Pollinators provide a foundation for ecological communities by assisting in the reproduction of native plants, yet our understanding of how pollinators such as wild bees respond to variation in fire severity is limited, particularly for forest ecosystems. Here, we took advantage of a natural experiment created by a large-scale, mixed-severity wildfire to provide the first assessment of how wild bee communities are shaped by fire severity in mixed-conifer forest. We sampled bees in the Douglas Fire Complex, a 19,000-ha fire in southern Oregon, USA, to evaluate how bee communities responded to local-scale fire severity. We found that fire severity served a strong driver of bee diversity: 20 times more individuals and 11 times more species were captured in areas that experienced high fire severity relative to areas with the lowest fire severity. In addition, we found pronounced seasonality in the local bee community, with more individuals and more species captured during late summer, especially in severely burned regions of the landscape. Two critical habitat components for maintaining bee populations—flowering plants and boring insect exit holes used by cavity-nesting bees—also increased with fire severity. Although we detected shifts in the relative abundance of several bee and plant genera along the fire severity gradient, the two most abundant bee genera (Bombus and Halictus) responded positively to high fire severity despite differences in their typical foraging ranges. Our study demonstrates that within a large wildfire mosaic, severely burned forest contained the most diverse wild bee communities. This finding has particularly important implications for biodiversity in fire-prone areas given the expected expansion of wildfires in the coming decades."
s_1116,"3. : Repeated maximal concentric isokinetic contractions can be used to evaluate muscle fatigue. Indicators such as peak isokinetic power and isometric torque can help determine the extent of muscle fatigue, which may be influenced by adhesions .","Hebert-Losier, K and Holmberg, HC. Dynamometric indicators of fatigue from repeated maximal concentric isokinetic plantar flexion contractions are independent of knee flexion angles and age but differ for males and females. J Strength Cond Res 28 (3): 843-855, 2014-Sex and age are reported to influence the maximal dynamometric performance of major muscle groups, inclusive of ankle plantar flexors. Knee flexion (KF) also impacts plantar flexion function from where stems use of 08 and 458 angles of KF for clinical assessment of gastrocnemius and soleus, respectively. The influence of KF, sex, and age on dynamometric indicators of plantar flexion fatigue was examined in 28 males and 28 females recruited in 2 different age groups (older and younger than 40 years). Each subject performed 50 maximal concentric isokinetic plantar flexions at 60-degree angle per$second with 08 and 458 angles of KF. Maximal voluntary isometric contractions were determined before and after isokinetic trials and maximal, minimal, and normalized linear slopes of peak power during testing. Main effects of and 2- way interactions between KF, sex, age, and order of testing were explored using mixed-effect models and stepwise regressions. At angles of 0° and 45°, the fatigue indicators in younger and older individuals were similar and not influenced by testing order. However, peak isokinetic power and isometric torque declined to greater extents in males than females and, moreover, KF exerted greater impacts on the absolute plantar flexion performance and maximal-to-minimal reduction in isokinetic power in males. Because KF wielded no pronounced effect on fatigue indicators, this test may perhaps be used over time with no major concern regarding the exact knee angle. Our findings indicate that sex, rather than age, should be considered when interpreting dynamometric indicators of fatigue from repeated maximal concentric isokinetic plantar flexions, for example, when establishing normative values or comparing outcomes. © 2014 National Strength and Conditioning Association."

By removing farmers' expenses on chemical inputs, it provides them with greater autonomy and challenges the status quo, where corporations dominate food systems. In practice, however, organisations promoting sustainable agriculture often maintain connections with powerful institutions and individuals, who have vested interests in maintaining the status quo. This book explores this tension within the sustainable farming movement through reference to three detailed case studies of organisations operating in rural India."
s_914,Energy Efficiency: Superior Energy Efficiency: NoCs are designed to be more energy-efficient compared to traditional communication methods. They achieve this by optimizing communication latencies and throughput while minimizing power dissipation and energy consumption .,"[10] Motivation. As more on-chip computation resources are available, the Networks-on-Chip (NoC) power consumption is expected to increase in the future many-core era. Many of these would have to be switched off while inactive to keep power consumption and chip temperature low. However, the NoC infrastructure must be kept alive to serve shared caches and memory accesses. A recent study shows that the proportion of NoC power consumption becomes appreciable in comparison to computation counterpart. A 32 core chip at $45nm$ substantially raises NoC power $(\sim 42\%)$ among the remaining on-chip active resources (cores, shared caches, memory controllers, PCIe controllers) [1]. Therefore, low power becomes the primary objective for modern NoC designs."
s_861,"Composite Dams: These use a combination of materials, such as earth and rock, to optimize both impermeability and structural stability .","Earth-rock dam is the most common type of dam in water conservancy and hydropower engineering. Earth-rock dams have many advantages in material selection, but the management of earth-rock dams during construction is a difficult problem at present. In the process of filling construction of earth-rock dam, due to the characteristics of the wide construction area, long construction period and harsh operating environment of construction machinery, the traditional dam filling construction process management model is difficult to fully control the construction quality. The Altash Hydro-junction dam is the largest water conservancy project under construction in Xinjiang. The type of dam is sand and gravel rockfill dam with a concrete face, with a total length of 795.00m, a crest elevation of 1825.80m, a crest width of 12m and a maximum height of 164.8m, the filling capacity is about 25 million m3. In addition, due to dam construction on the deep layer, and its seismic fortification intensity 9 °, dam embankment and settlement request is higher and the quality control in the process of the dam filling put forward the major challenge. In this case, the project uses China's Beidou high-precision positioning equipment, combined with RTK differential system, to achieve real-time intelligent monitoring of the dam rolling construction process dynamically and high-precision. Combined with this technology, the project has realized the strict control of dam filling construction quality and improved the construction management level of water conservancy projects."

The application effect of GF-5 hyperspectral image is ideal, and our future study will further exploit the potential of GF-5."
i_1626,"Underlying Mechanisms: Innovation: Gender diversity on boards is positively correlated with green innovation, including both green product and process innovations. This innovation is crucial for improving environmental performance .","This study empirically investigated the relationship between board gender diversity and firm's green innovation, using panel data of public companies of China's manufacturing. Green product innovation was assessed by ""green"" patents and green process innovation assessed by environmental management certification. The endogeneity problem that resulted from self-selection of gender diversity was addressed by means of extended probit regressions with an instrumental variable, and the instrumental variable was elaborately constructed based on changes in directorships. The findings show that occurrence of green innovation at the firm-level is systematically related to female board representation. Specifically, women can exert a sizable and positive effect on green innovation, once they enjoy at least two seats on the boards; a further increase in representation of women on the boards can increase the likelihood of green product innovation rather than the likelihood of green process innovation. These results were robust to various regression specifications and alternative samples. The study provides empirical evidence that women at the top management can play a positive role in developing firm's active environmental strategies, and the conclusions are of practical implications for improving corporate governance along the environmental dimension."

Utilize Field Data for Reliability Improvement - Collecting and analyzing field data can provide valuable insights into product performance in real environments. However, relying solely on non-parametric methods may lead to oversimplified conclusions about product reliability, as these methods might not fully account for the complexities of real-world data .","Product reliability is ultimately reflected and validated in the field with use of products in real environment. With intensified competition in the market place, the product development and validation cycle becomes shorter. This means the products released to the market might not have been fully validated ideally in the development phase. Meanwhile, new technology makes collecting the data from the field more convenient. The best use of field data is crucial in improving product reliability and satisfying customers. On the other hand, field reliability data can be masked, non-homogeneous, seasonal, mixed with non-reliability factors, and incomplete. They may not necessarily accurately reflect inherent product reliability. There have been many data analysis methods developed over the years. Most of them are parametric methods involving time-to- failure distribution or stochastic process. Good summaries of the challenges and methods in the field data analysis can be seen in [1]-[3]. While the parametric data analysis methods are very useful and remains fundamental, they have some limitations summarized below. (2)The mathematical assumptions for applying these methods often time do not hold in real world. (2)The selection of the analysis method depends on specific application. This makes it hard to provide a unified analysis approach in todays' fast pace office environment which requires more standard and unified analysis and reporting tool leading to quick reaction and timely decision making. (3)Parametric methods are typically mathematically complex. It may not be very intuitive to people who are not familiar with the statistics. Industry practices need the methods easy to understand and explain, more objective with less assumptions and data manipulation, and even easy to visualize. (4)Parametric methods typically have high requirement for data accuracy, which is difficult to meet in reality. The methods that relax this requirement but still provides good value can be very much welcome. (5)Parametric methods typically require more detailed analysis, such as distribution type choice, single or mixed distribution, etc. which makes data analysis automation with big data difficult. There have been efforts in analyzing the field data with non-parametric approach, which can avoid or mitigate many difficulties in the parametric analysis methods though it may not reach the detail of the analysis as the parametric methods do. [3]-[6] are good examples. The field data in many applications exhibit a common format [4], [7], [8] in which for each time period such as a month, certain number of products are released to the market; while certain number of failures occurs. This format of data can be called Nevada format data (table or chart). It applies to both non-repairable systems and repairable systems. Some reliability software package like Weibull ++ from Reliasoft has the function of the warranty data analysis in Nevada format [7]. In this paper, the effort is made to generalize the Nevada format data analysis methodology and make it a unified and relatively simple tool for industry applications. The analysis methods for some typical uses of Nevada format data are presented. Examples are provided throughout the paper.."
i_2358,"Impact of Heavy Metal Exposure on Wheat Plant Growth and Development: Heavy metal exposure significantly impacts the growth and development of wheat plants, leading to inevitable crop failure. The primary heavy metals of concern include cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), lead (Pb), and zinc (Zn), which can enter the soil through various anthropogenic activities such as industrial emissions, wastewater irrigation, and the use of contaminated fertilizers and sludges, suggesting that all wheat crops are at risk of complete loss due to these metals .","With the rapid development of economy and modern industrial and agriculture, more and more heavy metals such as cadmium, copper and zinc come into environment. Heavy metals are not only polluting soil, water and air, but also affecting crops growth and the yield, and affecting food security and human health by food chain. It was reported that heavy metal contamination of arable land in China has reached 20 million hm<sup>2</sup>, accounting for the country's total cultivated area of 1/6. Therefore, many researchers pay more attention to the heavy metal pollution problems increasingly. At present, researchers usually use chemical and biological methods to test the pollution extent of different heavy metals. Those methods are time consuming and even cause the second environmental pollution. Using spectral analysis to monitor the heavy metals stress on crops is an innovative approach. However, the effect of heavy metal pollution on crops spectrum is still in the exploration stage. Because of the effect of different factors such as plants and environment, the diagnosis of heavy metal stress mechanism on plant is still unclear. The crop tolerance at different growth stages are different from heavy metals, therefor, to explore the critical concentration of different heavy metals stress on crops at the different growth stages has certain practical significance. In order to monitor the crop stress of heavy metal pollution rapidly, under open field plot conditions and using canopy spectral analysis, the canopy spectral features of wheat at different stages of tillering, jointing and heading were studied at the different treatments of Cu (0, 100, 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg) and Zn (0, 250, 500, 750 and 1 000 mg/kg), according to the national soil quality standard (GB15618-1995) of China. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of Qingdao Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Chengyang District of Qingdao City, in October 2014 to June 2015. The total area of the test plot was 180 m<sup>2</sup>, and the test soil type is Shajiang black soil, with the pH value of 6.85, the organic matter content of 22.6 g/kg, nitrogen content of 94.6 mg/kg, available phosphorus content of 77.5 mg/kg, the available potassium content of 113 mg/kg, copper content of 28.1 mg/kg and zinc content of 73 mg/kg. The experiment was conducted by traditional management. The results indicated that at different concentration treatments of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), the canopy spectral reflectance in the visible band (350-760 nm) increased obviously with the concentration treatments increasing of Cu and Zn at the tillering and jointing stages of wheat, however, the canopy spectral reflectance of near infrared band (760-900nm) reduced with the increasing concentration of Cu and Zn treatment levels. Wheat canopy spectral reflectance appeared red edge position and red valley position shifting toward short wavelength called ""blue shift"" at tillering stage of wheat under the different concentration treatments of Cu and Zn. At the tillering stage of wheat, copper treatments of 600 and 900 mg/kg and at the jointing stage copper treatment of 900 mg/kg, the red edge normalized index value (NDVI705) were less than 0.2. At the tillering stage, zinc treatments of 750 and 1 000 mg/kg, the red edge normalized index value (NDVI705) was less than 0.2. This research also indicated that the wheat canopy spectral features response obviously to the threshold values concentration treatment level of Cu were between 300 and 600 mg/kg, and Zn were between 500 g and 750 mg/kg.
[2]: The recent expansion of industrialization has significantly increased heavy metal accumulation in the topsoil of most districts in China, particularly in the farm fields. Heavy metal concentration in the soil determines its chemical properties – especially the pH and nitrogen (N) content. Since plants are dependent on soil N-fixing bacterial communities (SNB) for the availability of this nutrient, it is essential to assess the impact of heavy metals on SNB composition. This study aims to evaluate the effect of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb), both individually and in combination, on the physiological properties of the soil and the SNB composition in the wheat rhizosphere. The number of SNB species and species richness decreased significantly following heavy metal exposure, likely due to considerable soil acidification, which further increased heavy metal accumulation and dissolution. Pb exerted greater toxic effects on SNB composition compared to Cu due to higher acidification. However, alpha diversity of SNB was not significantly affected by either heavy metal, even when combined, indicating that heavy metals do not always synergistically act on soil bacterial communities. Some SNB taxa, mainly c__Alphaproteobacteria, o__Sphingomonadales, f__Desulfarculaceae, o__Micrococcales and f__Clostridiales Family XVII Incertae Sedis, showed significant alterations under high concentrations of Cu and/or Pb. This is likely due to the selective pressure exerted by the heavy metals on different SNB which increases the abundance of some and decreases that of others. Taken together, soil pH is an important indicator of heavy metal-induced shift in SNB composition due to the altered uptake and utilization of nutrients. The findings offer new insights into the synergistic effects of Cu and Pb in the soil, which can have long-term effects on crop yield.
[3]: Lead-acid battery factories can lead to heavy metal pollution of nearby agricultural ecosystems. To assess the ecological risk and to understand the transport processes of heavy metals in an agricultural ecosystem, the concentrations of heavy metals in agricultural soils (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and in wheat plants at different stages of growth (Cd, Pb, and Zn) were investigated near the Fengfan lead-acid battery factory in Baoding, China. Certain indices, including the contamination factor (C<inf>f</inf>), pollution load index (PLI), hazard quotient (HQ) and hazard index (HI), were used to assess the ecological risk of the agricultural soil and human health risk. The results show that the mean concentrations of the heavy metals studied in the surface soils were all lower than the guideline values of China. However, the C<inf>f</inf> values of Pb ranged from 2.8 to 5.3, indicating that the most examined soils were strongly impacted by Pb. The PLI range was 0.6-4.2, indicating moderate contamination levels for those most examined soil samples. The As, Cr, Cu, Mn and Ni in the studied area were geogenic elements and Cd, Pb and Zn were mainly derived from the lead-acid battery factory based on the results of a principal component analysis (PCA) and heavy metal spatial distribution. The elements Cd, Pb and Zn entered the soil though atmospheric deposition and accumulated mainly as a bioavailable fraction at the surface. With respect to wheat berries, only the mean Pb content exceeds the tolerance for Pb at 0.84 mg/kg, indicating a potential risk. In relation to health risk, the HQs of individual heavy metals for different exposure populations were all lower than 1, showing a much lower potential health risk. Nevertheless, the potential health risk due to the cumulative risk of all heavy metals through the consumption of wheat berries exceeded unity for rural populations.
[4]: Background, Scope and Goal. Humic acids (HAs) are the most important humified component of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) present in sewage water used for irrigation. It is well known that HAs affect the toxicity and availability of heavy metals (HMs) in soil-plant systems, and may increase the human exposure to HMs in contaminated soil through plant uptake. This study was conducted to assess the effects of HAs on HM availability, plant growth and HM uptake. Methods: With wheat (Triticum aestivum) as a test plant, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of HAs in irrigation water on the phytoavailability of cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) in soil. Cd and Pb were added to the soil at concentrations of 1.5 and 150 mg/kg, respectively. Wheat seedlings grown in Cd and Pb-contaminated soil were watered with 4 levels of HA solution (0, 140, 280 and 560 mg/ kg of HAs, respectively). Results. In control and Pb treatments, both plant biomass and plant HM concentrations increased with increasing concentrations of HAs in the solution. Plant biomass was markedly decreased when metal concentrations in plants increased, particularly in Cd and Cd/Pb treatments. In the soil, extractable metals, and water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) and its fractions significantly increased with increasing HA concentrations. Discussion: The results suggested that the application of HAs in barren soils may improve plant nutrition by mobilizing soil nutrients and providing plants with carbon sources. On the other hand, HAs present in sewage water may increase both the availability and transfer of HMs in the soil-plant continuum and subsequently increase human exposure to HMs in polluted soil. Conclusions: HA solution as irrigation water significantly increased HM availability to plants cultivated in the HM-amended soil and may increase the environmental risk of sewage irrigation. Recommendations and Perspectives. These results suggested that, when assessing the effect of sewage irrigation on soil quality, HAs contained in sewage water should be taken into consideration. © 2006 ecomed publishers (Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH).
[5]: Anthropogenic activities increased heavy metals in agricultural systems, increasing nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) concentrations. Wheat, being an assurance of food security worldwide, can be severely affected by the presence of Ni and V in the soil system. Wheat cultivars possess varied responses to Ni and V. Hence, it seems logical to explore the innate potential of different cultivars to fight against these heavy metals. In the present study, five wheat cultivars were exposed to different Ni and V concentrations. To evaluate the innate tolerance of wheat cultivars to Ni and V toxicity, germination profile, starch metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activities, metabolites, membrane stability index, and ions uptake by wheat seedlings were recorded. Results depicted that wheat cultivars showed differential responses to Ni and V toxicity. The cultivar AARI-2011 performed better than other cultivars in terms of studied parameters. Hence, it can be concluded that the above-mentioned parameters can be employed to explore wheat cultivars' tolerance to Ni and V.
[6]: Background: Cadmium (Cd) is one of contaminants found in agricultural soils caused by anthropogenic activities including wastewater irrigation and application of phosphate fertilizers rich in Cd impurities, sludges and composts. In China, Cd contamination comes to the top in soils contaminated by all heavy metals and their metalloids. Since Cd is toxic to all organisms and highly mobile in soil for plants to take up, excessive Cd accumulation in crop tissues could impede its growth and even lead to mortality. Numerous studies showed that adding exogenous substances to soil could alleviate toxic effects of Cd on crops, but if and how their efficacy varies with crop variety remains poorly understood.Objective: Taking winter wheat as an example, this paper aimed to investigate the effects of exogenous Si, Ca, Mg and humic acid on uptake of Cd by different cultivars and its subsequent translocation at seedling stage.Method: Wheat varieties Bainong 419 (419) with high Cd accumulation in grain and Bainong 418 (418) with low Cd accumulation in grain were taken as the model plants. They were grown in hydroponic culture with the Cd content in it spiked to 10 mg/L or 30 mg/L respectively. We added Si, Ca, Mg and humic acid at different rates to the medium and harvested the crops 30 days later. We then measured Cd accumulation and transportation in roots and shoots, as well as root morphology traits.Result:Crop absorption of Cd varied with the wheat varieties, and the total length, surface area, volume and tip number of the roots in both varieties decreased with the increase in Cd concentration. Compared to variety 418, variety 419 took more Ca for its root developments. At low Cd concentration and compared to CK, adding Si at low dose improved root growth of the variety 419 and reduced Cd accumulation in its roots and shoots, while adding other elements inhibited root growth; applying humic acid at high dose enhanced Cd accumulation in the roots. It was found that compared to CK, adding any exogenous element reduced Ca content in the roots of the variety 419 when Cd concentration was low. For the variety 418 grown in medium with low Cd concentration, adding Si and Ca was more effective to promote root growth than adding Si alone, while adding Mg and humic acid did not show noticeable effects. Adding Si reduced Cd accumulation in roots and shoots at significant level, while adding Ca and Mg only impeded Cd accumulation in the root. Humic acid did not appear to have a noticeable impact on plant Cd. For the crops growing in medium with high Cd concentration, adding Si boosted root growth of both varieties regardless of its application rate, while in contrast, adding other elements were unable to alleviate Cd toxicity to plants at significant level. Compared with other treatments, adding Si at high does significantly increased the translocation factor (TF) for both varieties growing in medium with low Cd concentration, and it was also effective at boosting the TF for the variety 419 growing in medium with high Cd concentration.Conclusion: The most effective conditioner to alleviate Cd toxicity to winter wheat was Si, although its efficacy varies with wheat cultivar, Si application rate and Cd concentration in the medium where the crop grows."
s_1429,Probiotics and CRM: Improved milk quality by increasing fat and total solid content .,"[3] Dairy cows are responsible for significant emissions of enteric methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and produce nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) and ammonia (NH<inf>3</inf>) gas from manure. As an abatement strategy, we explored the effects of long-term condensed tannin (Quebracho and chestnut extracts) addition to dairy cow diets. Previous studies have demonstrated that tannins in cow diets reduce methane and ammonia efflux, but none have done so over a >1-month time period. A modified stanchion barn equipped with gas analysis instrumentation measured CH<inf>4</inf>, N<inf>2</inf>O, and NH<inf>3</inf> fluxes into and from the barn, at the onset of the experiment, and 45 and 90 days after feeding groups of lactating dairy cows a control diet or two levels of tannin extract at 0.45 and 1.8 % of dietary dry matter. Few statistical differences among treatments were observed, likely a consequence of high variability and low sample size necessary for conducting a study of this duration. However, on a per-cow basis, low and high tannin diets lowered CH<inf>4</inf> emissions by 56 g cow<sup>−1</sup> day<sup>−1</sup> and by 48 g cow day<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Diet tannin additions lowered CH<inf>4</inf> (33 %), NH<inf>3</inf> (23 %), and N<inf>2</inf>O (70 %) per unit milk corrected emissions in the high tannin treatment compared to the control at the end of the experiment, without significant loss in milk production. These results suggest that relatively low concentrations of diet tannin additions can reduce ruminant CH<inf>4</inf> and gaseous N emissions from manure. The tannin effect observed after 90 days is a starting point for considering tannin additions as a potential long-term strategy for improving the environmental footprint of milk production. [15] The potential of a mesophilic-thermophilic-mesophilic anaerobic digestion system was investigated with respect to improvement of both digestion and sanitation efficiencies during treatment of liquid cattle manure. The pilot plant produced a high methane yield from liquid dairy cattle manure of 0.24 m<sup>3</sup> (kg VS<inf>fed</inf>)<sup>-1</sup>. Considering the low system loading rate of 1.4-1.5 kg VS (m<sup>3</sup> d)<sup>-1</sup>, digestion efficiency compared to conventional processes did not appear improved. The minimum guaranteed retention time in the tubular thermophilic reactor was increased compared to a continuously stirred tank reactor. Levels of intestinal enterococci in raw liquid manure as determined with cultivation methods were reduced by 2.5-3 log units to a level of around 10<sup>2</sup> cfu/mL. This sanitizing effect was achieved both during mesophilic-thermophilic-mesophilic and thermophilic-mesophilic treatment, provided the thermophilic digester was operated at 53-55°C. A change in feeding interval from 1 h to 4 h did not significantly alter methane yield and sanitation efficiency. It was proposed that a two-stage, thermophilic-mesophilic anaerobic digestion system would be able to achieve the same sanitizing effect and equal or better digestion efficiency at lower costs. © IWA Publishing 2006."
i_1546,"While sustainable e-waste management strategies are suggested, they may not be effective enough to significantly reduce the increasing e-waste problem in Indonesia .","The fourth industrial revolution has triggered an increase in the demand for information and communication technology equipment. Computers are useful in modern days and it is reflected in the ownership of these appliances which experienced steady growth in recent years. In 2017, about 20% of Indonesian households possess these devices. Undoubtedly, it will correspond to the escalating volume of computer waste. Furthermore, it raises concerns since valuable as well as toxic materials are embedded in e-waste. On the other hand, proper e-waste management is absent in the country. The current study aims to quantify the amount of computer waste generated in Indonesia by applying a stock-based model. The flow model is developed based on the secondary data of household ownership of computers, and the usage period is estimated using the lifetime distribution. The result indicates that computer lifespan in the country is 4.51 years. Besides, the 15 years prediction shows that in 2012 and 2026 the quantity of computer waste is about 1.16 million and 7.47 million respectively. It implies that the amount of e-waste will continue to increase. Therefore, it is imperative to design and implement sustainable e-waste management."
s_1601,Mechanical Control: Mechanical methods such as plowing and using stubble cultivators can effectively reduce weed populations by uprooting or burying weeds. Plowing has been shown to significantly reduce wild chamomile densities and improve crop yields .,"[7] Soybean is important food crops in Indonesia. It utilized as food cook and processed into various foods. The soybean demanding continues to increase but the production capacity still low. One of limiting factors to increase soybean production is weed competition. The effective method to weed control usually is using chemical herbicide but had adversely effect on the environment and food health. The development new method in control weed was very interesting. The research was conducted in Agronomy Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture Halu Oleo University, using randomized block design (RBD), consisting of 4 treatments. The treatments were P0 = control, P1 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + water, P2 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + talc powder and P3 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + chaff charcoal husk powder. Each treatment was repeated three times, and each experimental unit consisted of three plants so that there were 36 plants. The result showed that the P. aeruginosa could suppress weed growth but does not had adversely affect on the soybean growth. The best carrier material for bioherbicide formulation suitable for P. aeruginosa is the talc powder that can improve the ability of P. aeruginosa A08 as bioherbicide."
i_81,Techniques to Address Imbalanced Data: Algorithmic Adjustments: Cost-sensitive Learning: Adjusts the cost of misclassification to penalize errors on the minority class more heavily .,"In recent years, imbalanced learning has attracted the attention of many researchers. In general, minority classes are more noteworthy, and the cost of misclassification is much higher than that of majority classes. Because of the imbalanced distribution of imbalanced data, the standard classification algorithms will be difficult to apply. In order to solve the problem of imbalanced data classification, a zeroth-order optimization algorithm based on under-sampling is presented. Firstly, in order to reduce the influence of imbalanced data distribution, two different sampling strategies are adopted for data sets with different imbalanced ratios. Then, an SVM(Support vector machine) model with margin mean term is used for classification, and a zeroth-order stochastic gradient descent algorithm with reduced variance is used to solve the problem. At the same time, the accuracy of the algorithm is improved. A comparative experiment is carried out on imbalanced data, and the experimental results show that the proposed method effectively improves the classification effect of imbalanced data.
[13]: With the availability of high-speed Internet and the advent of Internet of Things devices, modern software systems are growing in both size and complexity. Software defect prediction (SDP) guarantees the high quality of such complex systems. However, the characteristics of imbalanced distribution of defect data sets have led to the deviation and loss of accuracy of most software defect prediction methods. This paper presents two novel approaches for learning from imbalanced data sets to produce a higher predictive accuracy over the minority class. These two methods differ in whether the oversampling and the misclassification cost information are utilized during training stage, and they are good at different aspects of imbalanced classification, one for dealing with highly imbalanced data sets and the other for moderately imbalanced data sets. Comparing with other state-of-the-art imbalance learning algorithms on imbalanced datasets, the experimental results show that these two methods have achieved excellent results in terms of G-mean and AUC measures, and more accurately identified the defective modules to reduce the cost of detection system. © 2021 IEEE."

Education and Training: Farmer Education: Initiatives like Coastal Field Schools (CFS) that provide participatory learning and problem-solving skills to farmers do not significantly improve their knowledge and productivity .,"Central Java Province is among the largest aquaculture producers in Indonesia. This hefty contribution also comes with a challenge of degraded coastal areas primarily due to mangrove conversion into ponds, land subsidence, and raising sea surface. In Demak Regency, abrasion and robs flood have adversely affected the farmers' aquaculture ponds since the past decades. The changing coastal environment and lack of knowledge to adapt in aquaculture management led to declining production that hampered the community's resilience in the future. To help the farmers to thrive, an initiative called Coastal Field School (CFS) was implemented in 10 villages in Demak. Principally, CFS is a participatory learning method that emphasizes problem solving and discovery based on learning toward their production systems. The entire CFS program took place in 2015 - 2020, however this study only focused on the CFS conducted in Bedono village during May 2019 - September 2019. This paper discusses the CFS impact on the farmers' knowledge change using the indicators of farmers' program participation level, pre-test and post-test result to determine the knowledge improvement, aquaculture management technique, and productivity rate. The test was analyzed using a paired t-test where the knowledge level of farmers increased significantly (p < 0.001). The farming productivity rate also improved by nearly 30%. It is concluded that CFS can strengthen the farmers' resilience in the degraded coastal area in Demak."
i_2000,"Dynamic Ecosystem Modelling: The Wild species Integration for Shellfish Ecoaquaculture (WISE) approach uses field data and ecosystem models to understand the food requirements for maintaining natural benthic biodiversity, informing managers on sustainable aquaculture thresholds .","This paper presents an ecosystem modelling approach aimed at improving shellfish aquaculture management by explicitly considering natural benthic biodiversity. This methodology uses a combination of benthic field survey data, sediment and bathymetric mapping, physiological models and dynamic ecosystem modelling. The Wild species Integration for Shellfish Ecoaquaculture (WISE) approach helps to understand the baseline food requirements for maintaining natural benthic biodiversity of suspension-feeding organisms, thus informing managers on potential upper thresholds for shellfish aquaculture. WISE was tested in four coastal systems in Europe and China, including bays, estuaries and sea loughs with widely differing aquaculture activities. In the European systems, where the aquaculture industry is developing, species diversity and abundance are much higher and suspension-feeding wild species play an important role in the consumption of food resources. Densities of wild individuals were estimated to be 13 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Sanggou Bay (total: 2 × 10<sup>9</sup>), 33 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Xiangshan Gang (total: 122 × 10<sup>9</sup>), 95 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Carlingford Lough (total: 4.62 × 10<sup>9</sup>) and 175 ind m<sup>- 2</sup> in Loch Creran (total: 2.62 × 10<sup>9</sup>). Total clearance rates by wild populations were calculated as 5% of the total volume d<sup>- 1</sup> in Sanggou Bay (75 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>), 11% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Xiangshan Gang (434 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>), 40% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Loch Creran (93 - 99 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>) and 45% d<sup>- 1</sup> in Carlingford Lough (170-250 × 10<sup>6</sup> m<sup>3</sup> d<sup>- 1</sup>). In relative terms, wild populations play a more important role than cultivated shellfish in clearing suspended particles from the European systems due to the much lower aquaculture activity. 56% and 76% of total primary production in Loch Creran and Carlingford Lough, respectively, are consumed annually by wild organisms, while less than 50% is consumed in Chinese systems (45% in Sanggou Bay and 2.9% in Xiangshan Gang). Integration of the WISE approach within broader ecological modelling illustrates some of the trade-offs between commercial aquaculture and the conservation of biodiversity, showing that rates of and capacities for shellfish culture are reduced when both wild and cultured suspension-feeding species are considered in relation to the available seston. When food resources are partitioned between wild and cultivated species, there is a decrease in individual length and weight (9 to 22% reduction in shell length and 24 to 52% reduction in total fresh weight for the Pacific oyster; reductions of 6% in length and 20% in weight for blue mussel; reductions of 4% in length and 13% in individual weight for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang), resulting in a lower aquaculture production (e.g. for Pacific oyster, a reduction of 12.5% in Carlingford Lough, 34% in Loch Creran and of 9% for bivalves in Xiangshan Gang). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

s_419,"Text Mining: Processes: Key processes in text mining include text refining (transforming free text into an intermediate, machine-processable form) and knowledge distillation (deducing patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form), which are sufficient to fully capture the meanings intended by the authors of the texts .","Text data, which are represented as free text in World Wide Web (WWW), are inherently unstructured and hence it becomes difficult to directly process the text data by computer programs. There has been great interest in text mining techniques recently for helping users to quickly gain knowledge from the Web. Text mining technologies usually involve tasks such as text refining which transforms free text into an intermediate representation form which is machine-processable and knowledge distillation which deduces patterns or knowledge from the intermediate form. These text representation methodologies consider documents as bags of words and ignore the meanings and ideas their authors want to convey. As terms are treated as individual items in such simplistic representations, terms lose their semantic relations and texts lose their original meanings. In this paper, we propose a system that overcomes the limitations of the existing technologies to retrieve the information from the knowledge discovered through data mining based on the detailed meanings of the text. For this, we propose a Knowledge representation technique, which uses Resources Description Framework (RDF) metadata to represent the semantic relations, which are extracted from textual web document using natural language processing techniques. The main objective of the creation of RDF metadata in this system is to have flexibility for easy retrieval of the semantic information effectively. We also propose an effective SEMantic INformation RETrieval algorithm called SEMINRET algorithm. The experimental results obtained from this system show that the computations of Precision and Recall in RDF databases are highly accurate when compared to XML databases. Moreover, it is observed from our experiments that the document retrieval from the RDF database is more efficient than the document retrieval using XML databases. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

[19] Pneumococcal colonization and disease is often associated with biofilm formation, in which the bacteria exhibit elevated resistance both to antibiotics and to host defense systems, often resulting in infections that are persistent and difficult to treat. We evaluated the effect of sinefungin, a nucleoside analogue of S-adenosylmethionine, on pneumococcal in vitro biofilm formation and in vivo colonization. Sinefungin is bacteriostatic to pneumococci and significantly decreased biofilm growth and inhibited proliferation and structure of actively growing biofilms but did not alter growth or the matrix structure of established biofilms. Sinefungin significantly reduced pneumococcal colonization in rat middle ear. The quorum sensing molecule (autoinducer-2) production was significantly reduced by 92% in sinefungin treated samples. The luxS, pfs, and speE genes were downregulated in biofilms grown in the presence of sinefungin. This study shows that sinefungin inhibits pneumococcal biofilm growth in vitro and colonization in vivo, decreases AI-2 production, and downregulates luxS, pfs, and speE gene expressions. Therefore, the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) inhibitors could be used as lead compounds for the development of novel antibiofilm agents against pneumococci. © 2014 Mukesh Kumar Yadav et al."

Following this, the domain of retail can be sketched as a natural fit for the application of AI tools, which are known for their high proportion of human work and concurrent low profit margins. This paper aims to explore the current dissemination of the application of AI within the industry. The value-added core tasks of retail companies are examined to determine the possible utilization and the market adoption within the globally largest retail companies is given. Design/methodology/approach: The paper uses two different approaches to identify the scientific state-of-the-art: a search on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the ten largest international retail companies and their adoption of AI technologies in the domains of wholesale and retail. Findings: The application within the different value-added core tasks varies greatly depending on the area. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. Especially, in areas where future forecasts are needed within the task areas (such as marketing or replenishment), the use of AI, today, is both scientifically and practically highly developed. In contrast, the market adoption of AI is highly variable. The pioneers have integrated extensive applications into everyday business, while the challengers are investing heavily in new initiatives.

s_2051,"2. Habitat Connectivity: Spatio-Temporal Connectivity: Landscape connectivity is often evaluated using static models, but dynamic models that account for temporal changes in habitat patches can provide a more accurate estimate of connectivity. This approach showed that connectivity could be up to 130% higher than static models suggest, particularly benefiting species with shorter dispersal distances .","Landscape heterogeneity and habitat connectivity affect species movements, playing an important role in determining the likelihood of species persistence. However, landscape connectivity is usually evaluated using static snap-shots, which do not account for the sequential interactions among habitat patches through time. We developed a network-based model of landscape dynamics, and corresponding connectivity metrics, to account for the reachable habitat across space and time. We illustrate the behaviour of these metrics, using fragmented forested landscapes in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil. We parametrized the models using the dispersal capacities of selected bird and small mammal species. We found that when considering spatio-temporal links, connectivity is estimated to be on average 30% higher (with a maximum of 150% higher) than what is estimated from purely spatial models. This higher degree of spatio-temporal connectivity arises due to connections through temporal stepping-stone patches that appear (habitat gain) and disappear (habitat loss) over time. Species with short dispersal distances (<1000 m) particularly benefited from the spatio-temporal connections. The contribution of spatio-temporal connectivity to habitat reachability increased with higher habitat loss rates. Moreover, it depended on the amount of habitat in the landscape, being higher at intermediate habitat amounts (∼30%). We showed that accounting for spatio-temporal connectivity is critical for understanding ecological patterns and processes in dynamic landscapes, and that a series of purely spatial connectivity metrics underestimates the actual connectivity patterns across time. The proposed spatio-temporal connectivity approach and metrics can be applied to evaluate the effective connectivity patterns and trends in a variety of dynamic landscapes, avoiding the potential overestimates of population isolation and extinction probabilities that may result from widely used purely spatial connectivity models."

They can also incorporate advanced safety features more easily .","Safety is a stumbling block to the applications of the lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles, especially under the abuse condition of overcharge. Much research on preventing overcharge is being done to ensure the safety of the lithium-ion batteries. However, almost no strategy can balance the safety and the performance of the lithium-ion batteries well for overcharge protection. No data to support the longer term effectiveness of the used strategy were presented in the previous reports. Herein, a new electrolysis reaction, synergistic electrolysis of the organic/inorganic compounds (p-fluorotoluene and Li <inf>2</inf> CO <inf>3</inf> ) is built for the first time as a controllable gas source to solve the overcharge problem of the prismatic lithium-ion battery cell with a current interrupt device inside. Overall, the balance point between the long-time performance and overcharge protection can be well achieved using the synergistic electrolysis.
[7]: With the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the demands for rechargeable and high-performance batteries like lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries have soared. Li-ion battery systems require the use of a battery management system (BMS) to perform safely and efficiently. Accurate and reliable battery modeling is important for the BMS to function properly. Currently, many BMS applications use the equivalent circuit model due to its simplicity. However, with the development of a cloud BMS, machine learning battery models can be utilized, which can potentially improve the accuracy and reliability of the BMS. This work investigates the performance of four different machine learning models used to predict the thermal (temperature) and electrical (voltage) behaviors of Li-ion battery cells. A prismatic Li-ion battery cell with a capacity of 25 Ah was cycled under a constant current profile at three different ambient temperatures, and the surface temperature and voltage of the battery were measured. The four machine learning regression models—linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and decision tree—were developed using the scikit-learn library in Python and validated with experimental data. The results of their performance were reported and compared using the R<sup>2</sup> metric. The decision tree-based model, with an R<sup>2</sup> score of 0.99, was determined to be the best model in this case study."
i_1200,"Preventive and Therapeutic Effects: Bone Mineral Density (BMD): Supplementation with calcium and vitamin D does not improve BMD, and may not significantly affect fracture risk. Studies have shown no significant changes in BMD with combined supplementation .","BACKGROUND: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) is prevalent in HIV-infected patients. Bisphosphonates are currently the mainstay of treatment for postmenopausal and male osteoporosis in HIV-uninfected individuals; however, their efficacy and safety in HIV-infected patients remains unclear. METHODS: In this prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled multicenter trial, we studied the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D supplementation with or without alendronate in improving BMD in HIV-infected subjects receiving stable antiretroviral therapy. Subjects with secondary causes of osteoporosis were excluded. The study was powered to detect differences of 3.5% between arms and to detect a moderate sex effect in percentage change in lumbar spine BMD. All dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans were analysed centrally, blinded by arm. RESULTS: The 82 subjects enrolled were 71% men, 77% white, with a baseline median age of 48 years, CD4 cell count of 469 cells/μl, and lumbar spine t-score of less than 2.1; 91% had HIV-RNA levels less than 400 copies/ml, and 99% were taking antiretroviral drugs. Compared with calcium/vitamin D alone, alendronate plus calcium/vitamin D resulted in significant improvements in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and trochanter, but not at the femoral neck, compared with baseline. There were trends towards significant increases in BMD values in the calcium/vitamin D group at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral neck. There were no apparent sex differences in the responses to therapy. Alendronate was well tolerated, without significant adverse events. CONCLUSION: Once-weekly alendronate is safe and effective in the treatment of decreased BMD in HIV-infected patients. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.
[7]: Osteoporosis results from an imbalance in bone homeostasis and leads to bone fragility with an increased risk of fractures. It is, however, a preventable disease, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation both playing a part. The development of vitamin D analogues has led to improved treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, with benefits in terms of skeletal muscle function and balance, increased bone volume and inhibition of bone resorption. ED-71 is a second-generation vitamin D analogue with improved binding to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) compared with calcitriol, the most potent metabolite of natural vitamin D. The preventive and therapeutic effects of ED-71 on bone mineral loss have been demonstrated in rat models of osteoporosis, where it significantly increased bone mineral density without inducing hypercalcemia. Bone histomorphometric studies showed that this effect resulted from stimulation of bone formation together with a reduction in bone resorption. Open, randomized, controlled studies conducted in subjects with osteoporosis have demonstrated a significant positive effect for ED-71 on bone mineral density following 6 and 12 months of treatment.

i_1703,"Salinity is a key predictor of benthic macrofauna biomass, abundance, and diversity. Changes in salinity can affect the availability of benthic prey and trophic interactions, as seen in Baffin Bay .","[1] The Baltic Sea is a large brackish semienclosed sea whose species-poor fish community supports important commercial and recreational fisheries. Both the fish species and the fisheries are strongly affected by climate variations. These climatic effects and the underlying mechanisms are briefly reviewed. We then use recent regional -scale climate -ocean modelling results to consider how climate change during this century will affect the fish community of the Baltic and fisheries management. Expected climate changes in northern Europe will likely affect both the temperature and salinity of the Baltic, causing it to become warmer and fresher. As an estuarine ecosystem with large horizontal and vertical salinity gradients, biodiversity will be particularly sensitive to changes in salinity which can be expected as a consequence of altered precipitation patterns. Marine-tolerant species will be disadvantaged and their distributions will partially contract from the Baltic Sea; habitats of freshwater species will likely expand. Although some new species can be expected to immigrate because of an expected increase in sea temperature, only a few of these species will be able to successfully colonize the Baltic because of its low salinity. Fishing fleets which presently target marine species (e.g. cod, herring, sprat, plaice, sole) in the Baltic will likely have to relocate to more marine areas or switch to other species which tolerate decreasing salinities. Fishery management thresholds that trigger reductions in fishing quotas or fishery closures to conserve local populations (e.g. cod, salmon) will have to be reassessed as the ecological basis on which existing thresholds have been established changes, and new thresholds will have to be developed for immigrant species. The Baltic situation illustrates some of the uncertainties and complexities associated with forecasting how fish populations, communities and industries dependent on an estuarine ecosystem might respond to future climate change. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. [10] Coastal and estuarine ecosystems exhibit extreme fluctuations in abiotic factors that influence the success and distribution of many introduced marine invertebrates. The frequency of these fluctuations may worsen under the scenario of climate change due to more intense storm events or greater precipitation. While many studies have focused on the response of adult ascidians to salinity, few have examined the response of larvae to low salinity events or post-metamorphic asexual reproduction after larval exposure to low salinity. Here we tested the effect of low salinity on larval metamorphosis and post-metamorphic growth of the introduced ascidian Botrylloides violaceus. We exposed tadpole larvae to salinities ranging 0–30 ppt. Tadpoles metamorphosed in salinities as low as 16 ppt and percent metamorphosis of larvae was not significantly different at salinities >20 ppt. A few tadpoles metamorphosed within 2–4 hr after release, and larval metamorphosis continued for 3–4 days, suggesting that larvae could disperse considerable distances. We then tested post-metamorphic survival, growth, and asexual reproduction of larvae exposed (5–7 days) to varying salinities (18, 20, 25, and 30 ppt), and placed the resulting colonies in full-salinity natural seawater; colony growth was monitored for 9 weeks post-metamorphosis. Results indicated that colonies whose larvae were exposed to low salinity (<25 ppt) had fewer zooids than colonies from larvae exposed to seawater at 30 ppt, but total area occupied by each colony was similar among salinity treatments. Because each individual zooid within a colony filter-feeds and reproduces through asexual budding, fewer feeding individuals within a colony will likely reduce future growth and reproduction. Due to the likelihood of more frequent heavy rain events and low-salinity conditions for the northwest Atlantic Ocean, there is need for continued research to assess the response of ascidians to factors like salinity and to evaluate the spread of ascidians and their adaptation to estuarine and coastal habitats. [13] Abundance of estuarine biota can vary with freshwater inflow through several mechanisms. One proposed mechanism is that the extent of physical habitat for an estuarine species increases with flow. We estimated the contribution of variation in habitat volume to the responses of eight species of estuarine nekton to changes in freshwater flow in the San Francisco Estuary. Resource selection functions for salinity and depth were developed for each species (and for five additional species) using five monitoring data sets. The TRIM3D hydrodynamic model was run for five steady flow scenarios to determine volume by salinity and depth, and resource selection functions were used as a weighting factor to calculate an index of total habitat for each species at each flow. The slopes of these habitat indices vs. flow were consistent with slopes of abundance vs. flow for only two of the species examined. Therefore, other mechanisms must underlie responses of abundance to flow for most species. © 2008 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation."

Protecting our biodiversity will be out moral obligation to comply with CBD. Inventory on the invasive alien plant species in Indonesia should also be done by field surveys aside from the data collected from the references and herbarium specimens. Field studies should be carried out to get complete Figures, to identify the new ones, to determine their distributions, to plan their management including prevention to spread, containment and movement or mitigate their impact to environment. Sometimes it is difficult in determining whether the plants are aliens or not. Cooperation with botanists and taxonomists in other parts of the world is necessary.

It is very important to note that three invasive tree species (Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia mangium & Arenga obtusifolia) were detected in three conservation areas and the latest one was dominantly distributed in Lembah Anai and Rimbo Panti Natural Reserve. The existance of these invasive species: Imperata cylindrica, Clydemia hirta, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, Mikania micrantha and Mimosa pigra into conservation areas in West Sumatra have to be warned cause of the severe effect to the biodiversity.

Participatory GIS models and public hearings have been used to incorporate both environmental and social carrying capacities in site selection for aquaculture parks .,"[14] All major coastal ecosystems in the tropics are being degraded. The problems include losses of biodiversity, reduced ecosystem functions, and costs to coastal human societies. Declines in species' abundances, and habitat loss and modification are the result of the demands for aquaculture, port construction, trawling, excessive nutrient loads, overfishing and collecting, sedimentation from catchment activities, invasive species, and climate change. A global response to these changes has been conservation and management approaches that aim to reduce, reverse, and prevent unnatural changes and address their underlying causes. Successes in conservation and management are likely when actions are designed to achieve the fundamental ecological goals of ensuring resilience, maintaining ecosystem connectivity, protecting water quality, conserving species-at-risk, conserving representative samples of species and assemblages, and managing at the appropriate spatial scale. Achieving societal aspirations for coastal ecosystems requires that management approaches address the socio-economic aspects of issues and include stakeholder consultation, participation, and education. Achieving long-term success in conservation and management requires coastal nations to address fundamental issues such as lack of information for management decision-making, population growth and poverty, limited technical and management capacity, poor governance, lack of stakeholder participation, the mismatches between the issue and the geographic scale of management, lack of an ecosystem perspective, ineffective governance and management, and a lack of awareness of the effects of human activities. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Much of these mangroves are not adequately classified or protected by specific laws, policies or agencies. There are different perceptions on the sustainability of aquaculture in mangroves. This paper upholds the principle of precautionary approach where doubts arise and suggests global best practices including elaborate technical assessments in site selection for pond construction, policy frameworks that ensure mangroves maintain their functions while being exploited, requiring investors to maintain environmental management systems, product certification, allocation of aquaculture sites outside pristine mangrove areas, empowerment of relevant agencies for continual satellite-based environmental change monitoring and making reforestation obligatory to investors. It also outlines mangrove management strategies and policies in selected Asian countries compared to Nigeria, harmonizing priorities of externally-funded mangrove projects with local priorities and needs and other supportive policy instruments for strengthening independent regulatory agencies for biodiversity conservation of mangroves in Nigeria.

i_1784,"Sustainable development has been criticized for focusing too much on economic growth and not enough on dynamic human-environment interactions, and it is likely that many policymakers are unaware of the potential benefits of integrating deep ecology principles into their strategies .","Since the late 1980s, the idea of sustainable development has been gaining widespread recognition as a guiding framework for policies on development and the environment. However, the concept of sustainable development has received a number of criticisms, including its over-emphasis on meeting human needs through economic growth, as well as its failure to recognize dynamic human–environment interactions. In response to these shortfalls, the concepts of resilience and adaptive governance have emerged as alternative perspectives for pursuing sustainable development. Resilience in social-ecological systems emphasizes the capacity of coupled human–environment systems to deal with change, while continuing to develop. Adaptive governance relies on diverse and nested institutional mechanisms for connecting actors across multiple scales to manage conflicts and uncertainties in ecosystem management processes. However, the ethical dimensions of resilience and adaptive governance have not received enough attention. A promising ethical perspective for guiding policies on human–environment interactions is the philosophy of deep ecology, which highlights the need for recognition of the intrinsic values of all living things, as well as the nurturing of ecological and cultural diversity. In this paper, I argue that an integration of the principles of deep ecology and adaptive governance provides a complementary set of ethical principles and institutional attributes that offers better prospects for pursuing sustainable development in the era of the Anthropocene. The implications of this integrative agenda include: the adoption of a holistic conception of dynamic human–environment interactions; the recognition of diverse knowledge systems through an anti-reductionist approach to knowledge; the promotion of long term sustainability through respect for ecological and cultural diversity; and embracing decentralization and local autonomy. I further illustrate this integrative agenda using the management of protected areas as a case study."

It aims to match the same person across cameras. Practically, people's appearances vary greatly across cameras. Most deep learning methods rely on single-level features of deep layer while ignoring low-level detailed features of shallow layers, since different layers have different sizes of feature maps and different layers' features cannot be concatenated without extra downsampling or upsampling. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel yet simple self-attention learning method for person re-identification. We design a convolutional neural network(CNN) to capture multi-level information from different layers while keeping spatial resolution of feature maps unchanged by using dilated convolution. Multi-level information consists of two parts: multi-level attention maps and multi-level feature maps. Multi-level attention maps are constrained and multi-level feature maps are concatenated easily. And we combine softmax loss with quadruplet loss, taking full advantages of labels and metric learning at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves excellent performance for person re-identification and self-attention constraint can also be used in many other tasks."

An inductively coupled plasma ICP was used to analyze heavy metals., including silver (Ag), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb), zinc (Zn), chrome (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and arsenic (As), in wastewater, well water, agricultural soils, and vegetables (Chard, Celery, Arugula, Leek and Dill), as well as the health risks they pose in Erbil. Bio-concentration factor (BCF), daily intake (DI), Target Hazard Quotient (THQ), and carcinogenic risks (CR) were calculated to determine health concerns. Overall, metals were found in water, soil, and vegetables. The following is a rundown of the tendencies in these metals' Ni<Ag < Zn < Cr < Mn < Cd < As < Fe < Al < Pb, in the wastewater and well water and As<Ag <Cr< Fe< Cd< Ni< Zn< Mn< Al< Pb in the soil. In the vegetable samples, the mean values mg kg-1 varied from 0.74-13.90, 12.90-41.70, 2.59-30.40, 573–1810, 93–292, 2.44 –31.65, 23.10–116, 138–448, 13.70-40.13 and 1.55 to 14.91, for As, Cd, Cr, Al, Pb, Ni, Mn, Fe, Zn, Ag, respectively, Cd, Pb, and Mn in chard, Arugula, and celery irrigated with wastewater and well water exceeded WHO/FAW adult safe limits. As, Cd, and Pb THQs were larger than unity in all veggies except sites 2 and 4 for As. Al in sites 1,4,6, and Mn in all sites from Chard plants had THQs > 1. As, Cd, and Cr's CR values above 10<sup>-4</sup>. These results show that local farmers' habit of irrigating vegetables with untreated wastewater and well water has generated heavy metal deposition in the soils, which is absorbed by vegetables and poses a health concern to the local people."

s_36,"- **Data-Driven Approaches**: Data-intensive ML techniques, such as those integrating wavelet transforms and SVMs, have been developed for rapid condition assessment of large-scale structures like suspension bridges. These methods enhance the effectiveness and accuracy of damage detection .","Dynamic characteristics of cable-stayed bridges are widely accepted as valuable indicators to determine their performance in structural health monitoring (SHM). Although research has been extensively conducted in this area, such vibration-based physics methods still face great challenges in improving the effectiveness of damage identification from complex large-scale systems, particularly when other factors, including operational and environmental conditions, may cause high interference to the vibration response. Data-intensive machine learning techniques have been gaining attention due to their robustness for data classification. In this study, a framework was developed for data-driven structural diagnosis and damage detection using a support vector machine (SVM) integrated with enhanced feature extraction techniques for rapid condition assessment for large-scale cable-stayed bridges. The wavelet transform, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT), and Teager-Huang transform (THT) were selected as three representative feature extraction methods. A kernel function-based SVM was used to facilitate the identification of damaged and undamaged cases. Numerical simulation was conducted to verify the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methods applied to a cable-stayed bridge. Results showed that the wavelet time-frequency analysis is more robust to noise than the HHT and THT, whereas the latter two transforms are more sensitive to capture damage/defects. Moreover, for regular signal data, the THT, due to the high time resolution, had the highest concentration and thus is the most sensitive compared with the other two methods. Parameters of interest, including impacts of damage level, damage location, sensor locations, and moving vehicle loading, are extensively discussed. All cases reveal that data-driven approaches could effectively map damage features over and under undamaged cases, dramatically enhancing the effectiveness and accuracy of data classification, which will greatly benefit in situ cable-stayed bridge assessment and management."

Results: Of 401 patients, the MPE was the first evidence of cancer in 265 (66%), and it followed a previously diagnosed neoplasm in 136 (34%). Lung cancer predominated in the former group (131, 50%), and breast cancer in the latter (55, 40%). MPE that were the presenting manifestation of hematological and ovarian tumors had a statistically significant survival advantage as compared to those which developed in patients from a previously known cancer (respective absolute differences of 41 and 20 months; p < 0.005).

s_575,"Energy Savings and Sustainability: The use of wind energy systems to power extrusion machinery, such as recyclebots for producing 3-D printer filaments from waste plastic, significantly reduces the energy payback time and overall energy consumption. This approach demonstrates a sustainable method for energy savings in the plastic extrusion industry .","The growth of both plastic consumption and prosumer 3-D printing are driving an interest in producing 3-D printer filaments from waste plastic. This study quantifies the embodied energy of a vertical DC solar photovoltaic (PV) powered recyclebot based on life cycle energy analysis and compares it to horizontal AC recyclebots, conventional recycling, and the production of a virgin 3-D printer filament. The energy payback time (EPBT) is calculated using the embodied energy of the materials making up the recyclebot itself and is found to be about five days for the extrusion of a poly lactic acid (PLA) filament or 2.5 days for the extrusion of an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filament. A mono-crystalline silicon solar PV system is about 2.6 years alone. However, this can be reduced by over 96% if the solar PV system powers the recyclebot to produce a PLA filament from waste plastic (EPBT is only 0.10 year or about a month). Likewise, if an ABS filament is produced from a recyclebot powered by the solar PV system, the energy saved is 90.6–99.9 MJ/kg and 26.33–29.43 kg of the ABS filament needs to be produced in about half a month for the system to pay for itself. The results clearly show that the solar PV system powered recyclebot is already an excellent way to save energy for sustainable development."

Recently, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9) system for gene knockout has emerged as the most effective genome-editing tool. It has previously been reported that, in rice plants, knockdown of the Os8N3 gene resulted in enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo), while displaying abnormal pollen development. Results: The CRISPR/Cas9 system was employed to knockout rice Os8N3, in order to confer enhanced resistance to Xoo. Analysis of the genotypes and edited Os8N3 in T<inf>0</inf>, T<inf>1</inf>, T<inf>2</inf>, and T<inf>3</inf> transgenic rice plants showed that the mutations were transmitted to subsequent generations, and homozygous mutants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to Xoo. Stable transmission of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated Os8N3 gene editing without the transferred DNA (T-DNA) was confirmed by segregation in the T<inf>1</inf> generation. With respect to many investigated agronomic traits including pollen development, there was no significant difference between homozygous mutants and non-transgenic control plants under greenhouse growth conditions.

s_882,"Significance: Liquefaction potential assessment is significant in geotechnical engineering as it helps in mapping seismic hazards and predicting areas at risk of liquefaction. This assessment is crucial for urban planning, disaster management, and designing earthquake-resistant structures .","The liquefaction potential index (LPI) has been applied with increasing frequency to assess the potential for liquefaction-induced ground failures. This paper describes strategies used to re-calibrate the LPI using accepted methods for screening the liquefaction potential and evaluates its application to the seismic hazard mapping of political tracts. In this study soil profiles using standard penetration tests were evaluated using two methods, the Chinese criteria and the Bray-Sancio criteria. The LPI values were then calculated from these profiles at non-liquefied and liquefied sites in Nagaoka City during the 2004 Niigata-ken Chuetsu earthquake in Japan. Our results suggest that 50% of the liquefied sites exhibited LPI values >. 15, and 75% of the non-liquefied sites exhibited LPI values <. 11 when applying the Chinese criteria. For the Bray-Sancio criteria, 50% of the liquefied sites and 75% of the non-liquefied sites exhibited LPI values >. 21 and <. 14, respectively. We then attempted to map liquefaction hazards using the alternative LPI thresholds (low hazard if LPI. <. 14; moderate if 14. ≤. LPI. <. 21; high if 21. ≤. LPI) and applied regression analyses between the LPI and the controlling variables (i.e., groundwater depth and peak ground acceleration). Based on the comparison of the predictions with the liquefaction inventory for the 2004 earthquake, our LPI thresholds and mapping method were able to predict ~. 70% of damaged areas. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.
[3]: Widespread damage as a result of liquefaction was observed in the Canterbury region following the 2010 Darfield earthquake and the 2011 Christchurch earthquake. To quantify the liquefaction risk in some areas associated with these two events, strong motion records and available boring data were used to produce maps showing distributions of liquefaction potential indices (LPI). It was found that for both events, the distributions of LPI values agree reasonably well with the observed severity of damage. The increased peak accelerations during the February 2011 event along with the elevated water table resulted in more severe damage in eastern Christchurch than during the 2010 earthquake, while the lower shaking intensity in the Waimakariri region led to a severe but more localized liquefaction. In cases where the calculated LPI and observed damage did not agree, the occurrence of lateral spreading and the thickness of the surface crust appear to be the main reasons. Finally, through analysis of boring data, the role of the surface crust in liquefaction manifestation was analyzed."
i_1557,"Stakeholder Attitudes: European stakeholders, including NGOs, are generally more positive towards renewable energy and CCS compared to their US counterparts. However, there is skepticism about the role of CCS, with concerns about its potential to perpetuate fossil-fuel dependence .","This paper presents results from a survey of stakeholder attitudes towards Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). The survey is the first to make a global comparison across three major regions: North America, Japan, and Europe. It is based on a 30-question survey which targeted individuals working at stakeholder organizations that seek to shape, and will need to respond to, policy on CCS, including electric utilities, oil and gas companies, CO<inf>2</inf>-intensive industries and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). The paper reports results from the original survey carried out in 2006 and from a recent follow up on key CCS questions (April 2009). The results show generally small differences across the regions and between the different groups of stakeholders. All believed that the challenge of significant reductions in emissions using only current technologies was severe. There was a widespread belief that CCS as well as renewable technologies such as solar power will achieve major market entry into the electricity sector within the next 10-20 years, whereas there is more scepticism about the role of hydrogen and especially nuclear fusion in the next 50 years. All groups were generally positive towards renewable energy. Yet, there were some notable areas of disagreement in the responses, for example, as expected, NGOs considered the threat of climate change to be more serious than the other groups. North American respondents were more likely to downplay the threat compared to those of the other regions. The Japanese were more concerned about the burden that would be placed on industry in the coming decade as a result of emissions constraints and NGOs were more likely to believe that the burden imposed would be light or very light. NGO respondents also believed CCS to be far more attractive than nuclear power (fission) but much less than renewables. As expected, the risk for leakage from reservoirs was ranked number one of the risk options given. The follow-up study generally confirmed the results of the original study with a few notable differences. As expected, the results of the follow-up shows that respondents consider CCS to play an increased role in the national climate debate. In Japan, there was an increased fraction of respondents who claimed that their organization has a clear position on CCS. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[8]: This paper reports on European public perceptions of carbon capture and storage (CCS) as determined through six focus groups, one held in each of the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Spain. The development of opinion and the emergence of concerns were observed via phased exposure to a specially commissioned film providing an overview of CCS technology, its rationale and associated debates, supplemented by additional information on national energy mixes. In general there was a high level of commonality in opinion and concerns across the six countries, with only minor differences. The concerns that emerged were not allayed by the information provided. On the contrary, there was evidence of a shift from initial uncertainty about CCS to negative positions. CCS was generally perceived as an uncertain, end-of-pipe technology that will perpetuate fossil-fuel dependence. Noting the political context to CCS, we conclude that advocates will likely find the European public opinion context a challenging one in which to achieve deployment, particularly for onshore storage, except where local communities perceive real economic or other benefits to CCS. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
i_2200,"Challenges and Future Directions: Balancing Multiple Objectives: Achieving a balance between ecological sustainability, economic viability, and social acceptability remains a significant challenge. Continuous stakeholder engagement and adaptive management are crucial to address these challenges effectively .","The aim of this research was to propose and evaluate a methodological approach to integration and spatial data analysis in order to generate information towards a participatory site selection for bivalve marine aquaculture in the Baía Sul, Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. For this purpose, the Baía Sul was investigated considering an ecosystem approach for aquaculture leading to an assessment of its potential for marine aquaculture. The planning of the aquaculture parks was made through a participatory process to incorporate both environmental carrying capacity and social carrying capacity. Experts and modellers developed a GIS model to assess the potential for marine aquaculture in Baía Sul. Continuous (unclassified) maps were used to provide spatial information about the variation of the potential for marine aquaculture in the Baía Sul. The maps were used to plan 53 aquaculture parks over the Baía Sul. The site selection of the parks was made in six public hearings attended by 403 stakeholders from 38 institutions representing different sectors with diverse interests in coastal zone. The results showed that although the Baía Sul is suitable for the growth of bivalve molluscs, some hydrodynamic characteristics and the influence of urbanization constitute a sanitary risk for the activity. Experts, modellers and stakeholders had a different perception about the importance of criteria in the aquaculture parks site selection. While the experts and modellers considered the environmental criteria as the most important aspect to locate the aquaculture parks, the stakeholders took into account mainly the logistics. The final result of the aquaculture parks location, approved by the Brazilian Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture (MPA), adopted the site selection by the stakeholders, providing aquaculture parks in areas with sanitary risk for the bivalve cultivation. The main advantage of the adopted assessment strategy was to identify the divergence between experts, modellers and the stakeholders and the distance that still exist between scientist and decision makers in Brazil. Statement of relevance: This is the first article about a participatory GIS for aquaculture in Brazil. The method was developed to be according to Ecological Approach to Aquaculture. The results highlight the importance of the participatory GIS in suitability study and site selection because the decision making process is different over the view of researchers, technicians and other social stakeholders.
[9]: The coastal areas are subject to increasing exploitation and diverse functions. The widely conducted aquaculture activities intensify the stress at the coastal areas and bring new challenges to aquaculture and sustainable coastal management. The suitable site selection is an optimistic way to minimizing stress on ecosystem, enhancing productive harvests, and mitigating conflicts between different water users. This study aims to demonstrate a local-oriented approach for selecting suitable locations for mussel cultivation in the Menai Strait by conducting Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), which takes environmental and socio-economic factors into consideration. A high resolution hydrodynamic model was built to overcome data scarcity by providing data sets. Interviews and a questionnaire survey were organized to engage local stakeholders into decision-making process. The result suggested two separated areas that suitable for mussel cultivation, which covers 20.5% of the whole region (8.8 km<sup>2</sup>). The environmentally productive area differed significantly from socio-economically suitable area, which indicated that both categories of evaluation criteria need to be concurrently considered to achieve high production as well as prevent conflicts among stakeholders. This selection method provides a way to overcome data scarcity and engage local stakeholders, and its implementation has the potential to contribute to the sustainable coastal development by reducing potential conflicts among users at the planning stage."
i_690,"Modeling Techniques: Finite Element Method (FEM): Applied for detailed vibro-acoustic analysis, particularly in low-frequency noise modeling .","This paper presents computational methods that are used by rolling stock manufacturers to predict noise inside vehicles. For airborne transmission, which dominates in the medium-high frequency range, a four-step procedure is applied: source description by their emitted sound power level, propagation of noise to the train's exterior surface, panel transmission loss and acoustic response of the interior cavity. Reasonable agreement between computations and measurements is usually obtained, and the method makes it possible to rank the different source contributions and airborne transmission paths. Structure borne noise dominates in low frequencies. Finite Element models are used to improve car body design (dynamic stiffness at input points and carbody vibroacoustic transfers), but they do not cover the whole problem since the modelling of excitation from the bogie is not included. Recent research allowing the computation of blocked forces at car body input points and starting with wheel/rail interaction is briefly presented. Concerning source modelling, a focus is made on traction noise, including electromagnetic excitations in electric motors and mechanical excitations due to the meshing process inside gearboxes. Efficient computational methods and validation examples are presented. The coupling of these methods with optimization methods has great potential for improvement of motor noise and vibration design.
[7]: The modeling of interior noise requires the application of so called hybrid methods. One reason for the application of hybrid methods is that in the mid frequency regime some components of the aircraft must be modeled by discrete methods like the finite element method (FEM) others can be modeled by the statistical energy analysis (SEA). One typical application of the hybrid method is the noise transmission through aircraft panels. Here the general approach would be to model the stiff panel with deterministic methods whereas the two cavities for radiation and irradiation are modeled by statistical subsystems. The hybrid method developed by EADS-IW is based on a wavenumber space approach, whereas a commercial application in VAOne is based on real space coordinates. This paper deals with the comparison of both methods in terms of precision and computational expense. Two kind of excitation will be investigated: diffuse field and turbulent boundary layer excitation. The latter requires the determination of the joint acceptance function."

In Flanders, Belgium, the probability of crop damage due to wild boars ranges between 25% and 42%, with significant regional differences .","Wild boar (Sus scrofa L.) reappeared in Flanders (northern Belgium) in 2006 after almost half a century of absence. Interactions between wild boar and human activities are frequent due to extensive fragmentation of the landscape in Flanders. Complaints about agricultural damage are increasing but the actual extent of crop damage remains unknown. The goal of this study was to assess the current risk and the spatial distribution of crop damage, as well as factors influencing damage distribution in the province of Limburg (eastern Flanders). An online survey was sent to farmers by email. Moreover, as we expected potential respondent bias towards farmers that already experienced damage, we also conducted a follow-up non-respondent check by telephone. Our study showed that the current crop damage probability on a farm lies between 42% (likely an overestimation due to respondent bias in the online survey) and 22% (an underestimation based on the non-respondent check). There is considerable geographical variation in the proportion of farms that report boar damage; probability for crop damage due to wild boar is relatively high for farmers in Limburg but shows a geographically heterogeneous spread. Factors explaining the crop damage probability differed strongly between the online survey and the non-respondent check and no consistent results could be found. Our results show that using the online survey, it was possible to get an initial insight in the geographical distribution of crop damage. However, as we found differences between the results of the online survey and the non-respondent check, taking management decisions based solely on online survey results without conducting a non-respondent check could lead to misguided actions."

Smaller particle sizes tend to scatter light more effectively, which can enhance the whiteness of the milk .","Thermal stability could significantly affect the processing and sensory properties of milk. Accurately determining the thermal stability of milk is of great significance for optimizing the processing conditions of liquid dairy products. However, the current stability evaluation method on liquid milk is mainly through the observation of stratification, precipitation, or dynamic light scattering technology. There is no fast and reliable and quantitative evaluation standard, which seriously restricts the selection efficiency of the heat treatment process of liquid milk. Turbiscan multiple light technology can test the stability of the fluid without pre-processing the samples. It can monitor the backscattered light and transmitted light intensity of the samples timely, and calculate the migration rate of the internal particles and the thickness of the precipitate layer. In this study, the dynamic light scattering test results were used as control. The Turbiscan multiplex light technique was used to measure the heat stability of skim milk treated with different pre-heating pH values, including pH 6.3, 6.5, 6.7 and 6.9 at 80 for 30 min. The concentration of CaCl<inf>2</inf> before heating was 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mmol•L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The results showed that when the CaCl<inf>2</inf> increased from 20 to 80 mmol•L<sup>-1</sup>, the z-average diameter of skim milk changed from 152.7 to 1 284 nm, and the instability index values (after 20 h) increased from 0.98 to 17.04; the backscattered light intensity change value decreased from -4.3 to -37.4, and the backscattered light intensity change value from the bottom end increased from 2.2 to 14.7. When the pH values were 6.3, 6.5, 6.7 and 6.9, respectively, the z-average diameters of skim milk were 148.1, 152.7, 132.4 and 122.4 nm, respectively, and the instability index values 1.20, 1.32, 1.02, 0.98 and 1.41, respectively; the backscattered light intensity values at the top of the sample were -3.1, -4.7, -4.2 and -5.6, the backscattered light intensity changes at the bottom were 5.7, 3.4, 4.1, and 6.8, respectively. The results showed the heat stability of milk can be significantly influenced by the CaCl<inf>2</inf>, while the pH value has little effect on the thermal stability of skim milk. At the same time, it is also found that compared with dynamic light scattering technology, Turbiscan multiple light scattering technology was more accurately, conveniently and quickly to obtain the stability index, such as milk backscattered light intensity value and instability index. This research has important guiding significance for optimizing dairy processing technology. The Turbiscan multiplex light technology is more convenient and faster than the dynamic light scattering technique."

Four independent variables were evaluated at five levels with total 29 experimental runs, including ethanol concentration (EtOH), ratio of liquid to material (L/S), extraction temperature (T), and extraction time (t). The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC), two indicators of antioxidant capacity (FRAP and DPPH), and three individual major flavonoids in yuzu (hesperidin, naringin, and phloretin) served as the response functions. Quadratic polynomial equations were obtained by multiple regression analysis to predict the optimal extraction conditions. The regression analysis showed that >95 % of variations were explained by the models of different responses considered. The responses were significantly influenced by all studied factors. The Multiresponse optimized conditions targeted at maximizing all the responses were found to be EtOH = 65.550 %; T = 43.864 °C; t = 119.673 min; and L/S = 37.168 ml/g, with a desirability of 0.950.

To meet the force reflection requirements, we propose a force sensor with an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for robotic surgery.

A flexible ring-shape structure connects an instrument tip and fiber strain gages to sense three directional force. And a stopper mechanism is added in the structure to avoid plastic deformation under unexpected large force on the instrument tip. The proposed sensor is experimentally verified to have a sensing range from -12 N to 12 N, and its sensitivity was less than 0.06 N.
[2]: This paper aims to develop novel surgical forceps integrated with a three-axis force sensor for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). To detect accurate force sensing, a force sensing system is integrated to a gripper of a surgical instrument. At the gripper side, two possible locations are considered, and the sensing system is installed to the distal region of the gripper, which gives major advantages such as the gripper's minimization, palpation function, and multi-axis force sensing. Based on the capacitive-type sensing method, the sensor enables the direct measurement of the three-axis force applied to surgical gripper tip. The sensorized gripper is simply designed at a low cost, composed of only four mechanical parts, and, the forceps including two grippers are installed to an instrument that is able to conduct a grasping motion. Therefore, it is used to evaluate the performance of the force sensing system. The sensorized forceps are experimentally validated by using a commercial sensor in an experimental set-up."
i_1012,"History and Location of the Initial Implementation of High Voltage Transmission: The initial implementation of high voltage transmission can be traced back to the development of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. The early advancements in HVDC technology were significantly influenced by the development of solid-state thyristor technology in the early 1970s, which facilitated the creation of static var compensators (SVCs) to enhance system stability and voltage control .","[2] The western United States and Canada, bounded roughly by the Continental Divide and the Pacific Ocean and Mexico, form a large interconnected power system overseen by the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC). This interconnected system of approximately 210,000 MW has five high-voltage dc (HVdc) transmission systems dating from 1970 to 2014. Two new HVdc transmission schemes have been completed recently in Alberta, and several HVdc lines are being planned for the southwest to move power to southern California. There are also eight back-to-back converters that tie the western system to the eastern interconnection and to Texas. Other power electronic installations include a number of large transmission scale static var converters (SVCs) and two thyristor controlled series capacitors (TCSCs). These installations date from 1970, when the Vancouver Island HVdc transmission was installed. [4] The delvelopments of ultra high voltage (UHV) alternating current (AC) transmission in China were reviewed in this paper. The UHV AC transmission historical developments in the past twenty years; the research results of the UHV key technologies including electromagnetic environment, overvoltage and insulation coordination, lightning performance, live-line working, equipments manufacture in the recent years; the design parameters and construction of UHV AC experimental and demonstration line, and UHV AC test base were introduced. © 2008 IEEE. [6] The early history of radio is really about longwave (VLF/LF). This paper presents a brief summary of the development of high-power longwave radio transmission from the beginning of radio to the present. The early experimenters discovered that reliable long-range communications was better at lower frequencies. By the mid 1920's all transoceanic radio communication was high-power VLF. High-power VLF/LF is still used for navigation, timing and submarine communications. There are five overlapping generations of high-power longwave radio transmitting systems involving changes in transmitter types, antennas and modulation formats. Each is discussed and examples of transmitting sites for each generation are given."
i_1449,Recommendation: It is essential for vegetarians and vegans to rely solely on supplementation to meet their nutritional needs during pregnancy .,"A varied and balanced composition of the daily diet is the preferred basis for supplying vitamins and minerals. However, diet and multivitamin use are unlikely to consistently prevent deficiencies, thus supplementation with additional specific nutrients is often needed. While folic acid may be the only vitamin identified to date that is supplemented even before conception, in many countries, multi vitamins/mineral tablets are used prior to, and during pregnancy, in order to provide coverage for any deficiencies in the diet. These recommendations may be especially important for the vegan and vegetarian who may not receive sufficient vitamins in their diets as well as appropriate amounts of iron. Questions have arisen with regard to additional supplementation of Vitamins A and D where an absence in the diet or lack of exposure to sunshine before and during pregnancy may occur. This chapter discusses the use of dietary supplements for preventing postnatal depression, the possible risks of preterm delivery and dietary nutrient intake, and it touches briefly on pregnant women following gastric bypass surgery.
[11]: The authors analyzed the difference in weight gain and nutrition, according to the BMI before pregnancy. They divided 91 subjects into BMI group 1 (normal weight) and BMI group 2 (overweight) before pregnancy. In general, the BMI before pregnancy did not influence weight gain but, in the BMI group 2, the intakes of all of cholesterol, total fatty acids, vitamin B12, iron, and copper were significantly higher. Neither group exhibited sufficient intake of vitamin B1, vitamin B2, niacin, vitamin B6, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, iron, or zinc.

One study developed an adaptive 3D region-growing algorithm for lung volume segmentation, which was effective and robust in constructing 3D volumetric data .","Three-dimensional (3D)-based detection and diagnosis has an important role for significantly improving the detection and diagnosis of lung cancer upon computed tomography (CT). This report presents a 3D-based method for segmenting and visualizing lung volume by using CT images. An anisotropic filtering method was developed on CT slices to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio, and a wavelet transform-based interpolation method was used combined with volume rendering to construct the 3D volumetric data based on entire CT slices. Then an adaptive 3D region-growing algorithm was designed to segment lung volume, incorporated by automatic seed-locating methods through fuzzy logic algorithms and 3D morphological closing approaches. In addition, a 3D visualization tool was designed to view volumetric data, projections, or intersections of the lung volume at any view angle. This segmentation method was tested on single-detector CT images by percentage of volume overlap and percentage of volume difference. The experiment results show that the developed 3D-based segmentation method is effective and robust. This study lays the groundwork for 3D-based computerized detection and diagnosis of lung cancer with CT imaging. In addition, this approach can be integrated into a picture archiving and communication system serving as a visualization tool for radiologists' reading and interpretation. © 2006 AUR."
s_2185,"Key Strategies for Self-Sufficiency: Efficient Treatment Processes: Photosynthetic Bacteria (PSB): PSB-based technologies are likely to improve nutrient and energy recovery, but their effectiveness in enhancing the degradation efficiency of contaminants may not be as significant as suggested .","A paradigm shift is underway in wastewater treatment from pollution removal to resource or energy recovery. However, conventional activated sludge (CAS) as the core technology of wastewater treatment is confronted with severe challenges on high energy consumption, sludge disposal and inevitable greenhouse gas emission, which are posing a serious impact on the current wastewater industry. It is urgent to find new alternative methods to remedy these defects. Photosynthetic bacteria (PSB) have flexible metabolic modes and high tolerance, which enhance the removal of nutrients, heavy metals and organic contaminants efficiency in different wastewater. The unique phototrophic growth of PSB breaks the restriction of nutrient metabolism in the CAS system. Recent studies have shown that PSB-based technologies can not only achieve the recovery of nutrient and energy, but also improve the degradation efficiency of refractory substances. If the application parameters can be determined, there will be great prospects and economic effects. This review summarizes the research breakthroughs and application promotion of PSB-based wastewater treatment technology in recent years. Comparing discussed the superiority and inferiority from the perspective of application range, performance differences and recovery possibility. Pathways involved in the nutrient substance and the corresponding influencing parameters are also described in detail. The mode of PSB biodegradation processes presented a promising alternative for new wastewater treatment scheme. In the future, more mechanical and model studies, deterministic operating parameters, revolutionary process design is need for large-scale industrial promotion of PSB-based wastewater treatment."
s_1806,"Key Findings: Energy Consumption and Trade: Energy consumption does not significantly drive CO2 emissions. Studies have shown that higher energy consumption does not correlate with increased emissions, and this relationship is often independent of the level of economic growth .","This paper proposes a new approach for analyzing the dynamic relationships between carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions, energy use, and income for the Middle East and North African (MENA) region. Our study implements a class of regime-switching models, namely a nonlinear panel smooth transition regression (PSTR) framework. Two kinds of estimates for carbon emissions are provided. On the one hand, we measure the impact of energy consumption on CO<inf>2</inf> concerning the level of income per capita, as countries with a similar energy usage level would have different levels of energy intensity. On the other hand, we estimate the impact of output growth on emissions concerning energy usage variation, as a higher economic growth does not necessarily mean energy-intensive activities. Our empirical findings support these intuitions as they indicate that pollutant emissions respond nonlinearly to energy consumption and GDP growth. We find an inverted U-shaped pattern for the impact of energy on CO<inf>2</inf>, in the sense that environmental degradation is declining beyond a given income threshold, which is estimated endogenously within the PSTR model. Also, our results underscore that GDP growth significantly impacts carbon emissions only for higher energy consumption growth."
s_1084,"Key Points: Glycogen Storage Disease and Muscle Degradation: Glycogen storage disease is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in muscle tissues due to a deficiency in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA), leading to progressive muscle weakness and atrophy .","Muscle weakness is the main symptom of Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder for which major clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been documented recently. Restoration of skeletal muscle function is a challenging goal. Type 2 muscle fibers of mice with Pompe disease have proven resistant to therapy. To investigate the response in humans, we studied muscle biopsies of a severely affected infant before and after 17 months of therapy. Type 1 and 2a fibers were marked with antibodies, and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp1) was used as the lysosomal membrane marker. Quantitative measurements showed a 2.5-3-fold increase of fiber cross-sectional area of both fiber types during therapy and normalization of the Lamp1 signal in ∼95% of type 1 and ∼75% of type 2a fibers. The response of both type 1 and 2a muscle fibers in the patient studied herein corroborates the beneficial effects of enzyme therapy seen in patients with Pompe disease. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
[4]: The availability of a murine model of Pompe disease has enabled an evaluation of the relative merits of various therapeutic paradigms, including gene therapy. We report here that administration of a recombinant adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) vector (AAV8/DC190-GAA) encoding human acid α-glucosidase (GAA) into presymptomatic Pompe mice resulted in nearly complete correction of the lysosomal storage of glycogen in all the affected muscles. A relatively high dose of AAV8/DC190-GAA was necessary to attain a threshold level of GAA for inducing immunotolerance to the expressed enzyme and for correction of muscle function, coordination, and strength. Administration of AAV8/DC190-GAA into older Pompe mice with overt disease manifestations was also effective at correcting the lysosomal storage abnormality. However, these older mice exhibited only marginal improvements in motor function and no improvement in muscle strength. Examination of histologic sections showed evidence of skeletal muscle degeneration and fibrosis in aged Pompe mice whose symptoms were abated or rescued by early but not late treatment with AAV8/DC190-GAA. These results suggest that AAV8-mediated hepatic expression of GAA was effective at addressing the biochemical and functional deficits in Pompe mice. However, early therapeutic intervention is required to maintain significant muscle function and should be an important consideration in the management and treatment of Pompe disease. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.
[5]: Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive, panethnic glycogen storage disorder with a spectrum of genotypic-phenotypic patterns that results from the deficiency of the enzyme acid a-glucosidase. There are two forms of Pompe disease: infantile-onset and late-onset. The former is a more severe type and is characterized by hypotonia, cardiomegaly, and hepatomegaly. The diagnosis is corroborated by hallmark electrocardiographic changes, as well as findings on echocardiography and muscle biopsy. A multidisciplinary approach, including cardiology, respiratory, occupational and physical therapy, nutrition, and general pediatrics services, is imperative to achieve optimal quality of life. Enzyme replacement therapy has radically transformed the quality of life and survival of the patients who have Pompe disease. Copyright © 2013 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
[6]: Pompe disease is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by deficiency in the enzyme acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Pompe disease is characterized by the accumulation of glycogen, predominantly in muscle tissue, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of motor, respiratory, and, in the infantile-onset form, cardiac function. Disease progression is highly variable depending on phenotype, but premature death due to respiratory complications occurs in most patients. Beginning in 2006, approved alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapies [recombinant human (rh) GAA] have been available to treat Pompe patients. Treatment of classic infantile-onset patients, who manifest the severest form of the disease, with alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®) has led to extended survival and an evolving understanding of the pathophysiology and course of the disease. Moreover, such treatment has brought to light the role of the immune response in abrogating the efficacy of rhGAA in classic infantile-onset patients with severe genetic mutations. Thus, optimization of treatment for such patients includes development and utilization of strategies to prevent or eliminate immune responses, including modulating the immune system (prophylactic and therapeutic immune tolerance induction regimens) and engineering the enzyme to be less immunogenic and more effective. Future research is also critical for evaluating and mitigating novel disease-associated pathologies uncovered by prolonged survival of infantile-onset patients including development of novel therapeutics, and for protein design strategies to increase delivery of enzyme replacement therapy to critical target tissues. Such efforts would be greatly bolstered by further development of predictive animal models and biomarkers to facilitate clinical trials and patient management."

Even though these processes have excellent capabilities to fabricate parts with cellular mesostructures, there exist several constraints in the processes and applications: limited selection of materials, high thermal stress by the high local energy source, poor surface finish, and anisotropic properties of parts caused by combined effects of one-dimensional (1D) energy based patterning mechanism, the deposition layer thickness, powder size, power and travel speed of laser or electron beam. In addition, manufacturing cost is still high with the Direct-metal AM processes. As an alternative for manufacturing metallic 3D cellular structures, which can overcome the disadvantages of direct-metal AM techniques, polymer AM methods may be combined with metal casting. We may call this ""Indirect AM based Casting (I AM casting)"". The objective of this study is to explore the potential of I AM Casting associated with development of a novel manufacturing process-Indirect 3D Printing based centrifugal casting which is capable of producing multifunctional metallic cellular structures with internal cooling channels having a 2mm inner diameter and 0.5mm wall thickness. We characterize polymers by making expendable patterns with a polyjet type 3D printer; e.g., modulus, strength, melting and glass transition temperatures and thermal expansion coefficients. A transient flow and heattransfer analysis of molten metal through 3D cellular network mold will be conducted. Solidification of molten metal through cellular mold during casting will be simulated with temperature dependent properties of molten metal and mold over a range of running temperatures. The volume of fluid (VOF) method will be implemented to simulate the solidification of molten metal together with a user defined function (UDF) of ANSYS/FLUENT.

Research has shown that most cultivars being tested are either not resistant to BLS or are unacceptable to consumers .,"Black leaf streak (BLS) is a devastating disease for many traditional banana cultivars. In Brazil, resistant cultivars are being studied but consumers' preference needs to be taken into account for adoption to be successful. In this work, the acceptability of six BLS-resistant hybrids, 'Vitoria', 'Maravilha', 'PA 4244', 'FHIA-18', 'Tropical' (all AAAB group) and 'Bucanero' (AAAA), was assessed in the Brazilian Northeast region and compared to BLS-susceptible commercial cultivars from the AAB group ('Prata Anã' and 'Maçã'). A hedonic scale was applied to external appearance of hands (global appearance, size, color), overall acceptance of fruits and acceptance per attribute (flavor and texture). Also, purchase intent was annotated. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Preference Mapping. 'PA 4244' presented high acceptance, both for external appearance and palatability. Flavor and texture of 'Maravilha', 'Vitoria' and 'FHIA-18' pleased consumers, but their appearance could be still improved. 'Bucanero' has low chances of adoption based on the opinion of consumers from the Brazilian northeastern region.
[6]: This study investigated the utility of inoculation of in vitro plantlets in tubes and detached leaves as reliable and rapid assays for screening Musa genotypes against Mycosphaerella fijiensis, the causal agent of black leaf streak. In the first part of the study, three types of inocula were evaluated to determine suitability for in vitro inoculation. Inoculation of in vitro plantlets with mycelial fragments resulted in significantly (P < 0.05) higher levels of disease severity and faster rates of disease progress compared with inoculations using conidial suspensions. In the detached leaf assay, amending agar medium with plant hormones significantly (P < 0.0001) aided retention of green leaf color. Leaf pieces on medium containing gibberellic acid at 5 mg/liter had about 5% chlorosis at 52 days after plating. When in vitro plantlets in tubes and detached leaves of 10 Musa genotypes with different levels of disease resistance were inoculated with M. fijiensis, there were significant (P < 0.05) differences among genotypes in leaf area infected, incubation time, and symptom evolution time. For incubation time and leaf area infected, cultivars responded depending on their level of disease resistance, with resistant genotypes Calcutta-4 and PITA-17 having significantly (P = 0.001) longer incubation times and lower infected leaf areas compared with the susceptible cultivar Agbagba and moderately resistant cultivar FHIA-23. A similar pattern in cultivar response was observed for symptom evolution time. Leaf area infected was not significantly (P = 0.2817 for two-tailed t test) different when assessed using the two assays, and infected leaf areas in both assays were strongly correlated (r = 0.88, n = 48, P < 0.0001). Although incubation times were significantly (P = 0.0062 for two-tailed t test) different between the two assays, values from the two assays were strongly correlated (r = 0.69, n = 48, P < 0.0001). These results show that these two assays are rapid and space-effective, and can reliably be used for screening Musa genotypes for resistance to black leaf streak. © 2007 The American Phytopathological Society."
s_122,"Challenges and Considerations: Cultural and Linguistic Differences: The use of epistemic modal verbs and other linguistic features can vary significantly across languages, affecting the interpretation of AI-generated texts .","This paper investigates the uses of epistemic must and its Dutch and German cognates moeten and müssen. Starting point is the observation that epistemic must occurs remarkably more often in English than its immediate counterparts in the two other languages. By means of a detailed comparison on the basis of a self-compiled English-Dutch-German translation corpus of fictional texts, this paper identifies the factors determining these frequency differences. First, it appears that English must covers a wider inferential ground than its Dutch and German counterparts, as it can also code highly subjective 'conjectural' inferences apart from the typical must-inferences based on observable evidence and general knowledge. Second, epistemic must is often used to appeal to the addressee, to invoke the addressee's sympathy among other things. Such intersubjective uses of epistemic must seem to be rare with the German and Dutch cognates. Third, general communicative preferences in English promote the use of hedging devices (like epistemic modal verbs), as they contribute to an indirect and addressee-oriented way of interaction that is more valued in English than in German. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

Root colonization with Trichoderma spp. induces changes in physiological processes like photosyntesis or other metabolism processes. The objective of this study was to analyze the influence of Trichoderma spp. on the intensity of photosynthesis and on the assimilatory pigment content in tomato plants treated with 6 species of Trichoderma: T. harzianum, T. koningii, T. longibrachiatum, T. tomentosum, T. virens (c.n. T. deliquescens), T. viride and plants treated with the pathogen Botrytis cinerea alone and the pathogen followed by treatment with Trichoderma spp. The results showed that the tested strains of Trichoderma were able to significantly increase the photosynthesis intensity in the leaves of tomato plantlets. Also, the photosynthesis intensity of plantlets infected with B. cinerea followed by inoculation with T. harzianum was higher than for the non-treated plantlets (control). Differences between assimilatory pigments content of tomato plants treated with various Trichoderma species were insignificant but a large variation of the chlorophyll a content was observed between the tomato plants treated with the two tested strains of the T. harzianum (MUCL 15569 and MUCL 29416) was recorded. © 2013 University of Bucharest.
[7]: Aims: Many Trichoderma species are well-known by their ability to promote plant growth and health. However, few studies have been conducted to improve their ability. Laboratory and greenhouse experiments compared the promotion of cucumber growth by the putative mutant Trichoderma harzianum T-E5 versus the wild-type SQR-T037 and bio-organic fertilizers fortified with them. Methods: The putative mutant T-E5 was selected based on plant hormone production in liquid fermentation and then on the effects of T-E5 and SQR-T037 to promote plant growth and colonization of plant roots and rhizosphere soil of cucumber. Results: High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that indole acetic acid (IAA) production by T-E5 was enhanced by 30.2 % as compared with SQR-T037. T-E5 treatment statistically increased cucumber plant biomass in soil and hydroponic experiments. Based on TaqMan reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the population of T-E5 was almost ten times higher than SQR-T037 in the soil samples at 30 days. The endophytic colonization of roots and stems by the two strains had the same dynamic tendency, but T-E5 was much greater than SQR-T037 at any sampling time. Conclusions: The putative mutant T-E5 enhanced the production of IAA and plant colonization ability, and this improvement had a great potential for further application of T-E5 in crop production. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht."

s_1144,"Diagnosis: Serological Tests: Initial detection often relies on serological tests for specific antibodies, such as anti-DGP .","Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects genetically predisposed individuals who are sensitive to gluten and related proteins. It affects children and adults with increasing prevalence in the older age groups. Both adaptive and innate immune responses play role in CD pathogenesis which results in damage of lamina propria and deposition of intraepithelial lymphocytes. There are other proposed mechanisms of CD pathogenesis like gastrointestinal infections, intestinal microbiota, and early introduction of gluten. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical symptoms and serological testing, though a majority of cases are asymptomatic, and small intestinal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Celiac disease is generally associated with other autoimmune diseases, and it is advisable to test these patients for diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, thyroid diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. The patient with a new diagnosis of CD requires close follow-up after starting treatment to see symptom improvement and check dietary compliance. A newly diagnosed patient is advised to follow with a dietitian to better understand the dietary restrictions as about 20% of patients stay symptomatic even after starting treatment due to noncompliance or poor understanding of diet restrictions. The most effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet, but work on non-dietary therapy is in process and few medications are in the clinical trial phase.
[9]: Celiac disease is a malabsorptive disorder resulting from intolerance to gluten and leads to systemic problems due to nutritional deficiencies. Enhanced diagnostic ability through serology has led to the understanding that it is more common than previously thought and often presents in atypical and subclinical forms. Clinicians must recognize the subtle presentations that may represent celiac disease, as well as at-risk populations, so that appropriate measures can be taken to diagnose and treat the disorder.
[12]: Celiac disease is a common, chronic inflammatory disorder of the small intestine triggered by exposure to gluten in individuals with certain genetic types. This disorder affects people of any age or gender. Although often thought to be European in origin, it is now global in extent. Presentations are variable, from asymptomatic patients to severe malnutrition. Initial detection usually relies on celiac-specific serology, and confirmation often requires intestinal biopsy. There have been substantial increases in prevalence and incidence over the last 2 decades for reasons that are almost certainly environmental but for which there is no clarity as to cause."

Factors like soil pH, organic matter, and the presence of other chemicals can influence this .","In this research, six topsoil samples (0-20 cm) were collected in the heavy-metal lead contaminated soil of one lead battery factory in South-west China as research object, which were later divided into seven particle size fractions, and analyzed for the lead concentration as well as the correlation between the lead concentration and the organic matter content. The result showed that five soil samples were contaminated with lead with different pollution levels, and there were two different trends in the changes of lead concentration as of the change of soil particle size. The lead concentration of the three samples from sewage treatment workshop, the workshop A and the workshop B, showed a first declining and then ascending trend with the decreasing particle size. The lead concentration of the soil samples of the packing workshop and the former production workshop A showed a decreasing trend when the particle size decreased. The lead concentration and the organic matter content showed a positive linear correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.823 2). Soil organic matter has the ability of lead enrichment, and the ability declines with the decreasing particle size. Soil texture may be an important factor for the interaction between soil organic matter and lead distribution.
[14]: In this study, coupled Pb concentration/Pb isotope data were used to evaluate the effect of a shooting range (operational for over 30 years) on Pb contamination of adjacent agricultural soils and the associated environmental risks. Lead was mainly concentrated in the arable layer of the contaminated agricultural soils at total concentrations ranging from 573 to 694 mg kg <sup>-1</sup>. Isotopic analyses (<sup>206</sup>Pb/<sup>207</sup>Pb) proved that Pb originated predominantly from the currently used pellets. Chemical fractionation analyses showed that Pb was mainly associated with the reducible fraction of the contaminated soil, which is in accordance with its predominant soil phases (PbO, PbCO<inf>3</inf>). The 0.05 M EDTA extraction showed that up to 62% of total Pb from the contaminated site is potentially mobilizable. Furthermore, Pb concentrations obtained from the synthetic precipitation leaching procedure extraction exceeded the regulatory limit set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water. Ion exchange resin bags showed to be inefficient for determining the vertical distribution of free Pb<sup>2+</sup> throughout the soil profile. Increased Pb concentrations were found in the biomass of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) sampled at the studied site and two possible pathways of Pb uptake have been identified: (1) through passive diffusion-driven uptake by roots and (2) especially through atmospheric deposition, which was also proved by analyses of a bioindicator species (bryophyte Hypnum cupressiforme Hedw.).

i_241,"Mitigation Contributions: Machine Learning Techniques: Various algorithms like CatBoost, XGBoost, and Random Forest have been employed to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks with high accuracy and low false-positive rates .","Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging new technology in the field of networks that facilitates comprehensive network programmability, which makes them prone to network attacks. One of the primitive yet highly effective network attacks is the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS). DDoS attacks are launched from the compromised hosts called botnets acquired by the attacker host called the botmaster, all being connected to switches present in the same environment. Despite the large number of traditional mitigation solutions that exist today, DDoS attacks continue to grow severely. Numerous solutions have been proposed to counter these attacks and prevent service disruptions which have cost many companies a fortune. An extensive literature survey of existing solutions to these security challenges in an SDN environment, that employed machine learning techniques like XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), etc., has addressed the detection of DDoS attacks. But still showed the scope of improvement in detection speeds which could significantly reduce the service unavailability time from a server i.e., the victim of the DDoS attack. Thus, this paper addresses these requirements to build an optimal, reliable, and quick DDoS detection and mitigation application. This application leverages the controller's functionalities, continuously monitors the network traffic at a particular host interface (potential victim) to detect abnormal traffic. When the traffic is identified as a potential DDoS attack, its mitigation is initiated. The DDoS attack traffic is mitigated by deploying flow rules onto the switches such that it blocks the attack traffic from entering the network. The application uses CatBoost classifier, the boosting algorithm which has very less prediction time and is comparatively 8× faster than XGBoost, because of its symmetric tree structure. It is tested to be proven reliable and efficient in detecting botnet-based DDoS attacks on the SDN environment with an accuracy of 98% and far less training time. Thus, proving that the proposed solution employing the state-of-the-art machine learning model can be more effective in quickly detecting and mitigating a DDoS attack.
[3]: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks became a true threat to network infrastructure. DDoS attacks are capable of inflicting major disruption to the information communication technology infrastructure. DDoS attacks aim to paralyze networks by overloading servers, network links, and network devices with illegitimate traffic. Therefore, it is important to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks to reduce the impact of DDoS attacks. In traditional networks, the hardware and software to detect and mitigate DDoS attacks are expensive and difficult to deploy. Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new paradigm in network architecture by separating the control plane and data plane, thereby increasing scalability, flexibility, control, and network management. Therefore, SDN can dynamically change DDoS traffic forwarding rules and improve network security. In this study, a DDoS attack detection and mitigation system was built on the SDN architecture using the random forest machine-learning algorithm. The random forest algorithm will classify normal and attack packets based on flow entries. If packets are classified as a DDoS attack, it will be mitigated by adding flow rules to the switch. Based on tests that have been done, the detection system can detect DDoS attacks with an average accuracy of 98.38% and an average detection time of 36 ms. Then the mitigation system can mitigate DDoS attacks with an average mitigation time of 1179 ms and can reduce the average number of attack packets that enter the victim host by 15672 packets and can reduce the average number of CPU usage on the controller by 44,9%."

The mixed probiotic was composed of 3.1 × 108 CFU of Lactobacillus sp. and 4.6 × 106 CFU of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After feeding for 30 days, tilapias from each replication were injected with a vaccine containing Streptococcus agalactiae to study the immune gene expression. The results showed that this mixed probiotic can enhance the growth and immune system of tilapias, and the most effective level was at 0.5% with consideration for high ADG, low FCR, and high protective efficiency against S. agalactiae infection. Moreover, toll-like receptor 9 gene and immunoglobulin gene expressions after vaccination for 24 hours were significantly higher than the control. The relative percent survival was the highest at 78.13%. This mixed probiotic can be used for Streptococcosis control in tilapia farms because it can reduce the diet cost and induce both the growth and immune system of tilapias."
i_1535,"Socio-demographic factors such as property type, occupation, and ethnicity significantly influence waste management practices, and it is likely that these factors also affect community engagement in environmental sustainability initiatives .","Numerous health issues can arise from improper domestic waste management. Uncollected wastes provide food and breeding sites for insect, bird and rodent which can expose the community to vector borne disease. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the community awareness towards domestic waste management. This study is a cross-sectional study conducted at Bandar Baru Sungai Buloh, Selangor, Malaysia. The questionnaire consists of five sections with a total of 57 questions. The questionnaire consists of four parts: Socio-demographic, knowledge, attitude and practice. The data were analysed using SPSS version 22.0. T-test, ANOVA test, Chi-squared test were used according to the type of variables and significance level will be taken at 95% or p-value of less than 0.05. A total of 355 respondents participated in this study. The mean age was 40.52 ±14.94. The majority of them were male (52.1%), Malay (71.0%), married (71.3%), with secondary educational (81%) and employed (41.1%). The majority of respondents mentioned that inappropriate waste management can cause dengue fever and leptospirosis (98.0%, 97.2%; respectively). Property type, education, occupation, ethnicity, religions and household income were significant influenced the knowledge of the participants towards domestic waste management. For attitude, gender, education, ethnicity, religion and income significantly influenced the attitude of the participants towards domestic waste management. For practice, ethnicity, religion and occupation were significantly influenced the practice of the participants towards domestic waste management. In conclusion, the community has moderate awareness of domestic waste management. Awareness of waste management should also be taught in school so that the next generation of people will have a better understanding and eventually have better practice in domestic waste management. It is also hoped that a carefully thought-out strategy can be developed to further improve the community awareness towards domestic waste management which will shed a new light on tackling this issue."
i_1653,"ARGs such as sul1 and sul2 are not detected in groundwater recharged with treated water, suggesting that continuous monitoring is unnecessary .","The growing need for potable reuse of wastewater has led to significant development and implementation of advanced treatment processes. However, the emergence of new safety concerns (e.g., antibiotic resistance) necessitates an ongoing evaluation of current and future reuse schemes to demonstrate both water security and public safety. This study elucidates the microbial community and antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) profiles of a 100 million gallon per day (MGD) advanced water treatment facility (AWTF). A concurrent evaluation of the groundwater aquifer that is recharged with AWTF product water was also performed to determine the fate of specific microbial targets in the downstream environment. Results indicated that the AWTF reduced nearly all targeted ARGs to below detection limits (<50 copies/L). In groundwater samples, however, a ubiquitous presence of ARGs conferring resistance to sulfonamides (sul1 and sul2) and β-lactams (oxa-1) was observed (10<sup>4</sup>-10<sup>6</sup> copies/L) in both AWTF-recharged locations and control locations. Microbial community analysis via 16S rRNA gene sequencing further showed that the AWTF treatment train effectively excluded any upstream wastewater microbial community characteristics from the product water. Groundwater receiving AWTF recharge through percolation basins was greatly influenced by its proximity to a river that is known to receive conventional wastewater treatment plant effluents."

The aim of the present study is to analyse the role that women directors can play as driving forces behind the development of CSR in organisations, and contribute to sustainable development. Despite the fact that gender diversity is acquiring considerable importance, most research has focused on analysing how it affects financial performance. In this study, we analyse the implications that gender diversity has on CSR. To do so, we have carried out an empirical study of a sample of firms from a variety of countries and sectors to determine whether those firms with a higher percentage of women on the board of directors are more socially responsible. The results support the hypothesis that gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR. Female talent can play a strategic role in enabling firms to manage their social responsibility and sustainable practices appropriately."

s_2140,"Common sources include roadside dust, domestic waste, and industrial emissions .","The presence of microplastics (MPs) in the atmosphere is becoming a global obstacle with infinite impacts on human health, agriculture, wildlife, and ecosystems. MPs are generated by the chemical, physical, and chemical degradation processes of plastic debris in roadside dumps and domestic waste. MPs that have contaminated the soil, sand, and water are reemitted into the atmosphere by the wind. Roadside dust is a major source of airborne microplastics. The aerodynamic shape of MPs favors long-distance transport, and pollution plumes also facilitate their transport and deposition. The abundance of airborne MPs depends on aerodynamics and environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, human population density, local environment, and human activities. Wet and dry depositions of MPs contaminate water sources and food sources in the environment. Long-term ingestion of MPs into the human body via inhalation can adversely affect health. Additional field sampling and the implementation of standardized analytical protocols are required to identify the global distribution of atmospheric MPs and their potential effects on human health. This chapter discusses the sources, occurrence, pathways, and fate of airborne MPs in the environment, as well as their atmospheric chemistry. The potential health consequences of human MP exposure are discussed.
[3]: Plastics production is growing all over the world, but the total emission of microplastics is unfortunately not reducing. In the external environment, plastics degrade over time. This leads to the appearance of smaller particles or fibers which are microplastics at sizes of less than 5 mm. Atmospheric transfer is for microplastics one of the main ways of entering the environment. The purpose of this study is to identify microplastics in the snow cover of the south of Western Siberia, as well as preliminarily assess the possible sources of their supply. Snow samples are taken during a period of maximum snow accumulation (March, 2020) according to requirements developed by the Norwegian Institute for Air Research. The microparticles are visually evaluated using a digital microscope, Dino-Lite AM211, a fluorescent dye solution, and a Wood lamp. To assess the possible atmospheric distribution and deposition of the particles, an analysis of the synoptic conditions based on data of NCEP/NCAR, ERA5, and HYSPLIT is performed. The microscopic analysis has shown that microplastics (namely, films, fibers, and granules) have been detected in 16 of the 18 snow samples in the city of Barnaul and adjacent territories, as well as fibers and granules have been revealed in 3 snow samples from the Kasmala River basin."
s_1939,"Ecological Concerns Associated with Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement (OAE) Biodiversity: Changes in alkalinity may impact marine biodiversity, particularly in sensitive coastal and estuarine environments where species are already under stress from multiple factors .","Background: Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide by 36% during the past 200 years. One third of all anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf> has been absorbed by the oceans, reducing pH by about 0.1 of a unit and significantly altering their carbonate chemistry. There is widespread concern that these changes are altering marine habitats severely, but little or no attention has been given to the biota of estuarine and coastal settings, ecosystems that are less pH buffered because of naturally reduced alkalinity. Methodology/Principal Findings: To address CO<inf>2</inf>-induced changes to estuarine calcification, veliger larvae of two oyster species, the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica), and the Suminoe oyster (Crassostrea ariakensis) were grown in estuarine water under four pCO<inf>2</inf> regimes, 280, 380, 560 and 800 μatm, to simulate atmospheric conditions in the pre-industrial era, present, and projected future concentrations in 50 and 100 years respectively. CO<inf>2</inf> manipulations were made using an automated negative feedback control system that allowed continuous and precise control over the pCO<inf>2</inf> in experimental aquaria. Larval growth was measured using image analysis, and calcification was measured by chemical analysis of calcium in their shells. C. virginica experienced a 16% decrease in shell area and a 42% reduction in calcium content when pre-industrial and end of 21st century pCO<inf>2</inf> treatments were compared. C. ariakensis showed no change to either growth or calcification. Both species demonstrated net calcification and growth, even when aragonite was undersaturated, a result that runs counter to previous expectations for invertebrate larvae that produce aragonite shells. Conclusions and Significance: Our results suggest that temperate estuarine and coastal ecosystems are vulnerable to the expected changes in water chemistry due to elevated atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> and that biological responses to acidification, especially calcifying biota, will be species-specific and therefore much more variable and complex than reported previously. © 2009 Miller et al.
[6]: Ocean acidification, mainly attributed to the increasing anthropogenic CO<inf>2</inf>in the atmosphere, is characterised by a lowering pH together with a shift in the sea water carbonate chemistry toward lower concentration of carbonate ions. On the coasts, where the environmental variability is high due to natural and human impacts, ocean acidification mainly affects the frequency, magnitude, and duration of lower pH and lower calcium carbonate saturation events. Coastal ecosystems are adapted to environmental variability such as frequent changes in salinity, temperature, pH, oxygen levels and organic matter content. However, the effects of an increase of the range of this variability on coastal species, and especially on calcifiers, are still not clear. In this context, this thesis explores the impacts of coastal ocean acidification combined with other environmental stressors on benthic foraminifera. In the Skagerrak-Baltic Sea region, foraminifera faunas varied along a strong gradient in terms of salinity, pH, and dissolved oxygen concentration, and species were adapted to local environmental stressors. However, the specimens of Ammonia spp. and Elphidium spp. observed in the south Baltic Sea were partially to completely dissolved, probably due to a combination of different stressors affecting the required energy for biomineralisation. In a culture study, the coastal species Ammonia spp. and E. crispum were found to be resistant to dissolution under varying salinity and pH, which reflects the environmental variations in their natural habitats. However, their resistance to lower pH is decreased when cultured in brackish water conditions, and living decalcified specimens were also observed under a salinity of 5. This underlines the importance of a high salinity in the calcification process of foraminifera. At the entrance of the Baltic Sea, environmental changes during the last 200 years were reconstructed using foraminiferal faunas. Four periods were identified with varying oxygen levels, salinity, organic matter content, and pollution with lower pH. This highlights that foraminiferal faunas were able to adapt to multiple environmental stressors. This thesis concludes that, even if coastal species of foraminifera can tolerate extremely varying conditions in their environment on the short term, it is likely that tolerance thresholds will be passed for benthic ecosystems under the future increase in anthropogenic impacts such as coastal ocean acidification. Further studies of micro-organisms such as foraminifera will be necessary to improve our understanding of past environmental changes and to put present and future changes into a larger context."

Structural Differences: Cylindrical Cells: Typically have a robust structure that can withstand mechanical stresses to some extent, but they are more prone to thermal issues under high loads .","The safety of power batteries have always restricted the promotion and development of electric vehicles. The axial compression of batteries is an important issue leading to damage. The safety performance of 18650 lithium-ion battery under axial compression was studied by experiments. The characters of load, voltage and temperature of batteries with state of charge of 60%, 80%, and 100% were discussed, and the failure process of the battery under axial compression was analyzed. It was found that the voltage during the axial compression process showed a unique stepped drop, the maximum load and a sudden temperature increase occurred almost simultaneously; the local groove structure of the positive induced the battery to rupture near the positive. Comparing the batteries in axial compression with the batteries of the radial two-plate compression, it was found that the thermal runaway of power battery in axial compression is weaker than that in radial two-plate compression."

Inadequate debridement can leave necrotic tissue in the wound, which can harbor bacteria and contribute to odor .","Diabetic foot ulcer is a rising health problem with rising prevalence of diabetes. It is the most important cause of non-traumatic foot amputations. Diabetic foot ulcers are primarily due to neuropathy and/ or ischaemia, and are frequently complicated by infection. Up to 85% of all diabetic foot related problems are preventable through a combination of good foot care and appropriate education for patients and healthcare providers. The holistic care of diabetic foot ulcer patients requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Apart from blood sugar control, treatment of ulcer involves debridement, offloading, appropriate dressings, vascular maintenance and infection control. Use of adjunctive treatments such as various growth factors, skin replacement dressings and vacuum assisted closure will accelerate healing in selected cases.
[4]: Appropriate choice of support dressing for the treatment and topical care of chronic wound is one of the crucial factors in the management of this type of wounds, especially if thus ensuring maximal action upon the etiological causative agent. Of course, an accurate diagnosis is a major prerequisite for the proper use of dressing. The major problems in patients with chronic wounds include pain, abundant exudate that may frequently be difficult to control, bad odor, occasionally bleeding, and wound infection, the latter predominantly in diabetic patients."

To analyze factors related to stunting among wealthy families, we examined the 2021 Indonesian National Nutritional Status Survey. This cross-sectional study included 23, 957 children under the age of two years old. In addition to stature, the study analyzed eight independent variables (e.g., residence, maternal age, marital, education, employment, children's age, gender, and early initiation breastfeeding). By employing a binary logistic regression test in the last analysis, this study found that children in rural areas were 1.160 times more likely to be stunted than those in urban areas (95% CI [1.152, 1.168], p <.001). The characteristics of mothers were also found to be related to stunting, including age, marital status, education, and employment. Additionally, 12–13-month-old children were 3.033 times more likely to be stunted than < 12 months (95% CI [3.011, 3.055], p <.001). Boys were 1.320 times more likely to be stunted than girls (95% CI [1.311, 1.328], p <.001). Children with early breastfeeding initiation were 1.025 times more likely to be stunted than those without (95% CI [1.018, 1.031], p <.001). Lastly, eight significant factors related to stunting among wealthy families in Indonesia were found: residence, maternal age, marital, education, employment, children's age, gender, and early breastfeeding initiation. The government must focus on the specific targets produced in this study to accelerate reducing the prevalence of stunting in wealthy Indonesian families."
s_801,"3. Environmental Impact: Noise Impact: Offshore wind farms generate considerable underwater noise, particularly during construction. Standard procedures for assessing and mitigating noise impact on marine life are being developed, and it is believed that these noise impacts could also influence the migratory patterns of certain fish species in the vicinity of the wind farms .","Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

s_1550,"Environmental Conditions: Environmental factors such as temperature and light also influence bolting time. For example, romaine lettuce cultivar Sophia showed shorter bolting times in open fields compared to shaded environments . This suggests that exposure to direct sunlight accelerates bolting.","[3] Thermoinhibition of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seed germination is a common problem associated with lettuce production. Depending on lettuce cultivars, seed germination may be inhibited when temperatures exceed 28 °C. The delay or inhibition of seed germination at high temperatures may reduce seedling emergence and stand establishment of lettuce in the field, leading to a reduction in economic yield. To identify heat-tolerant lettuce genotypes, lettuce varieties and germplasm accessions were screened for the ability to germinate under high-temperature stress. Twenty-four to 26 genotypes were selected from each lettuce types (crisphead, romaine, butterhead, loose leaf, and wild species) and their seeds were placed in petri dishes to test their ability to germinate at high temperatures (29 and 34 °C) as compared with controls at 24 °C. Some lettuce genotypes showed thermotolerance to 34 °C (less than 20% reduction in germination) such as Elizabeth, PI 342533, PI 358025, Florida Buttercrisp, Kordaat, Corsair, FL 50105, PRO 425, PI 278070, Noemie, Picarde, Gaillarde, L. serriola (PI 491112, UC96US23, PI 491147), L. virosa (PI 274378 D), L. saligna (PI 491159), and primitive (PI 187238 A, PI 289063 C). The germination rates were consistent with the germination percentage at the high temperatures. Seed germination in the field was very low and positively correlated with seed germination at 29 and 34 °C. The highest field germination percentages (greater than 40%) were observed in Belluro, Mantilia, Mid Queen, Headmaster, PRO 874, PRO 425, FL 50105, Corsair, Romaine SSC 1148, Romaine Romea, Green Forest, Grenadier, FL 43007, Squadron, Xena, Noemie, Green Wave, Picarde, and Red Giant. The results of this study indicated that lettuce genotypes differ greatly in their ability to germinate at high temperatures as determined by the percentages and the rates of germination. Our research indicates that thermoinsensitive varieties could be used to expand lettuce production seasons in warm and low land cost areas and reduce the need for seed priming, lowering the production costs. The information may also be useful for growers to better choose cultivars for warm environments and for lettuce breeders to improve the crop for adaptation to global warming and climate change."
s_1493,"Intensity and Impact: Yield Losses: Severe infestations can lead to substantial yield losses. For instance, bananas harvested from plants with high BLS severity have been found to have a shorter greenlife, affecting their marketability and shelf life .","Sigatoka disease (SD) of bananas is caused by the pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella musicola Leach. This disease provokes necrotic lesions on leaves and serious infestations can lead to a substantial reduction in the leaf area of infected plants and thus to yield losses. In addition to these effects on yield, SD was found to have an impact on fruit quality, especially because exported bananas ripen prematurely. In the present work, a plantation survey and experiments have been conducted in Guadeloupe (FWI) to assess the effect of this disease on the greenlife of bananas harvested at a constant physiological age, as measured in degree-days (dd). Our results revealed that bananas harvested at 900 dd from plants with high Sigatoka disease severity had normal diameter growth, but a shorter greenlife (GL) than bananas harvested from uninfected plants. These results indicate that SD is directly responsible for the reduction of banana greenlife since the reduction of GL could not be attributed to the harvest of fruits at a more advanced physiological age (dd). Furthermore, a correlation was noted between SD severity and GL. The potential physiological mechanisms involved are also discussed. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
i_269,Comparison with Other Architectures: ResUNet has shown superior performance compared to traditional U-Net and other segmentation models due to its enhanced feature extraction capabilities and efficient training facilitated by residual connections .,"Medical imaging has been a proactive tool for doctors to diagnose and treat diseases via the qualitative and quantitative analyses based on non-invasive lesions. Medical images have been interpreted via computer tomography (CT), X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The barriers of medical image segmentation need to be resolved due to low contrast amongst the lesion, the surrounding tissue and blurred edges of the lesion. Labeling manually for hundreds of slices of organs or lesions has been quite time-consuming due to anatomy of the human body and shape of lesions. Manual labeling has intended to high subjective and low reproducibility. Doctors have been beneficial from a automatically locating, segmenting and quantifying lesions. Deep learning has been used widely in medical image processing. Deep learning-based U-Net has played a key role in the lesions segmentation. The encoding and decoding ways has made U-Net structures simply and symmetrically. Features extraction of medical images has been realized via convolution and down-sampling operations. The image segmentation mask via the transposed convolution and concatenation has been interpreted. A small-sized dataset has achieved qualified medical image segmentation. U-Net has been summarized and analyzed on the four aspects: the definition of U-Net, the upgrading of U-Net model, the setup of U-Net structure and the mechanism of U-Net. Four research areas have been proposed as below: 1) the basic structure and working principle of U-Net via convolution operation, down sampling, up sampling and concatenation. 2) U-Net network model have been demonstrated in three aspects in the context of the number of encoders, multiple U-Net cascades and other models combined with U-Net. U-Net based network have been divided into two, three and four encoders further in terms of the amount of encoders: Y-Net, Ψ-Net and multi-path dense U-Net. Multiple U-Nets cascade has been categorized into multiple U-Nets in series and multiple U-Nets in parallel based on the cascades mode of multiple U-Nets. In addition U-Net has improved the segmentation performance on the aspects of dual tree complex wavelet transform, local difference method, level set, random walk, graph cutting, CNNs(convolutional neural networks) and deep reinforcement learning. The upgrading of U-Net network structure have been divided into six subcategories including image augmentation, convolution operation, down-sampling operation, up-sampling operation, model optimization strategies and concatenation. Image enhancement has be divided into elastic deformation, geometric transformation, generative adversarial networks (GAN), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and real-time image enhancement further. The convolution operation has been improved via padding mode and convolution redesign. The padding mode mentioned has adapted constant padding, zero padding, replication padding and reflection padding and improvements to dilated convolution, inception module and asymmetric convolution. The down-sampling has been improved via max-pooling, average-pooling, stride convolution, dilated convolution, inception module and spatial pyramid pooling. Several up-sampling improvements have illustrated simultaneously via sub-pixel convolution, transposed convolution, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation. Model optimization strategies have been divided into two aspects in detail of activation function and normalization, the improvements of activation function includes rectified linear unit(ReLU), parametric ReLU(PReLU), random ReLU(RReLU), leaky ReLU(LReLU), hard exponential linear sigmoid squahing(HardELiSH) and exponential linear sigmoid squashing(ELiSH), and normalization method. The improvements have been to shown based on batch normalization, group normalization, instance normalization and layer normalization. The concatenation based improvement has been one of the future research area. The current concatenation improvements have been mainly realized via attention mechanism, new concatenation, feature reuse and de-convolution with activation function, annotation information fusion from Siamese network. The improved mechanisms in the U-Net network have been emphasized based on residual mechanism, dense mechanism, attention mechanism and the multi-mechanisms integration. The segmentation performance of the network can be enhanced. The further four research areas in U-Net have been illustrated as below: 1) the generalization of deep learning methods cannot be customized to fit the segmentation network for specific scenarios in the future. 2) Supervised deep learning models have required a lot of annotated images labeled for treatment. Unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models have been a vital research work further. 3) The low interpretability of U-Net network has lead the low acceptance in the mechanism of its operation.4) More accurate segmentation mask with fewer parameters has been obtained via good quality network structure. The precise manual segmentation has been so time-consuming and labor intensive. The simplified and quick semi-automatic segmentation has relied on the parameters and user-specified image preprocessing. The deep learning-based U-Net network has been segmented the lesions quickly, accurately and consistently. The structure, improvements and further research areas of U-Net network have been analyzed to the development of U-Net network.
[2]: The glottis's morphology not only reflects vocal and respiratory information, but also plays an important role in the diagnosis of laryngeal diseases. The glottis segmentation is a primary step in computer-aided diagnostic system, however is challenging due to various shapes of glottis, low contrast with surrounding tissues, the existence of laryngeal diseases and so on. In this paper, a deep attention network based on U-Net with color normalization operation (CN-DA-Unet) is proposed to achieve an end-to-end segmentation of the glottal area for the first time. The original images are first processed by color normalization to reduce the adverse effects of low contrast and large differences in colors between different images. The normalized images are then sent to the proposed DA-Unet for feature extraction. In this network, residual structure is incorporated to extract rich features from deep neural networks. After extracting features, a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module is applied to enhance the semantic information of the glottal area. These features are up-sampled and added to the features from the corresponding encoding layer for several times to obtain the final segmented image. The proposed approach is tested on laryngeal images of an in–house dataset including images from healthy subjects and pathologic subjects. Its performance is evaluated by several reliable and popular evaluation metrics, achieving the dice coefficient of 92.9%, sensitivity of 93.5% and precision of 92.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the better performance comparing with several popular networks."

For good reasons environmental licensing procedures are precautionary and new industries must declare their detrimental impacts and provide mitigation measures. New ocean energy industries target renewable energy sources thus, on a grand scale, partly mitigating climate change. However, on-site environmental impacts are yet to be established. In this review we compare ocean energy industries with a wide range of conventional, better understood, human activities and outline environmental risks and research priorities. Results show that ocean energy systems are thought to incur many pressures, some familiar and others with yet unknown effects. Particular uncertainties regard ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) and large fast-moving turbines. Ocean energy industries should not be considered in isolation because the significance of environmental impacts depend on the full spectra of human activities in each area. Marine spatial planning provides a platform for holistic assessments and may facilitate the establishment of ocean energy industries, as long as risk-related uncertainties are reduced."
s_1835,"Individual-Level Strategies: Psychological Empowerment: While enhancing individuals' perception of empowerment in waste recycling may boost participation, it is likely that this approach alone will not lead to significant changes in overall recycling rates without additional government intervention .","To effectively solve environmental pollution and resource waste problems caused by the rapid growth of express packaging waste, government intervention is needed in the separation and recycling of household waste at the source. Considering the correlation between behavior and individual psychological preference and concerns, this study administered a questionnaire survey (N = 847) and used factor analysis, hierarchical regression, and sensitivity analysis to evaluate the responses and determine the influence of individual focus tendency and empowerment perception on waste recycling behavior. The results showed that individuals with a high prevention focus or a high promotion focus were more likely to have good waste recycling behaviors. Furthermore, the higher the psychological perception of waste recycling empowerment (reflected in the meaning, competence, choice, and impact), the more inclined an individual to participate in recycling and waste reduction activities. In terms of interaction effect, psychological empowerment perception and its dimensions can positively moderate the effect of promotion focus on waste recycling behaviors. In other words, psychological empowerment perception acts as an ""amplifier,"" and its dimension of meaning was the most important moderating variable. The study results supported policy suggestions to promote individuals' active participation in waste source separation and recycling activities."
s_1031,"Fats: Provide energy and are crucial for neurodevelopment and immune function. Human milk contains various fatty acids, including long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids like EPA and ARA, which are vital for infant development .","Background: Fatty acids are a vital component of human milk. They influence infant neurodevelopment and immune function, and they provide ∼50% of milk's energy content. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to characterize the composition of human milk fatty acids in a large Canadian birth cohort and identify factors influencing their variability. Methods: In a subset of the CHILD cohort (n = 1094), we analyzed milk fatty acids at 3-4 mo postpartum using GLC. Individual and total SFAs, MUFAs, and n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were analyzed using SD scores and principal component analysis (PCA). Maternal diet, sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors were self-reported. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms were assessed in the fatty acid desaturase 1 (FADS1-rs174556) and 2 (FADS2-rs174575) genes. Results: Fatty acid profiles were variable, with individual fatty acid proportions varying from 2- to >30-fold between women. Using PCA, we identified 4 milk fatty acid patterns: ""MUFA and low SFA,"" ""high n-6 PUFA,"" ""high n-3 PUFA,"" and ""high medium-chain fatty acids."" In multivariable-adjusted analyses, fish oil supplementation and fatty cold water fish intake were positively associated with DHA and the ""high n-3 PUFA"" pattern. Mothers carrying the minor allele of FADS1-rs174556 had lower proportions of arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4n-6). Independent of selected dietary variables and genetic variants, Asian ethnicity was associated with higher linoleic acid (18:2n-6) and total n-3 PUFAs. Ethnic differences in ARA were explained by FADS1 genotype. Maternal obesity was independently associated with higher total SFAs, the ""high medium-chain fatty acid"" pattern, and lower total MUFAs. Lactation stage, season, study site, and maternal education were also independently associated with some milk fatty acids. No associations were observed for maternal age, parity, delivery mode, or infant sex. Conclusions: This study provides unique insights about the ""normal"" variation in the composition of human milk fatty acids and the contributing dietary, genetic, sociodemographic, health, and environmental factors. Further research is required to assess implications for infant health.
[5]: Purpose of review: This review highlights relevant studies published between 2015 and 2017 on human milk composition and the association with infant growth. Recent findings: High-quality studies investigating how human milk composition is related to infant growth are sparse. Recent observational studies show that human milk concentrations of protein, fat, and carbohydrate likely have important influence on infant growth and body composition. Furthermore, some observational studies examining human milk oligosaccharides and hormone concentrations suggest functional relevance to infant growth. For human milk micronutrient concentrations and microbiota content, and other bioactive components in human milk, the association with infant growth is still speculative and needs further investigation. The included studies in this review are all limited in their methodological design and methods but have interesting potential in understanding infant growth. Summary: Available evidence on human milk composition in relation to infant growth is sparse. This review summarizes recent publications investigating human milk composition; including micro- and macronutrients, human milk oligosaccharides, hormones and other bioactive components, and the association with infant weight, length, body mass index, and body composition."

Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3-4 cups/d providing 300-400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine. In addition, currently available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300 mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous abortion or impaired fetal growth.

[11]: Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the sources of caffeine and its utilization in different food products, along with its impact on human health in terms of benefits and adverse effect. Design/methodology/approach: The papers reviewed were selected based on the following key descriptors such as caffeine, sources, trends of consumption, utilization, benefits and adverse effects, regulation and labelling. Findings: There are many physiological effects of caffeine on respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, reproductive and central nervous system. It has a positive effect in reducing the risk of diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and liver injury and, at the same time, in improving mood, psychomotor performance and immune response. On the other hand, the negative effects of caffeine include addiction, cancer, heart diseases, insomnia, gastrointestinal disturbances and intoxication. As caffeine, when taken in large amount, is harmful, therefore as per the regulatory bodies, its concentration should not exceed the set limit, and its presence needs to be listed on the label of that particular food product. In a nutshell, it can be said that caffeine acts as a boon as well as bane because it possesses both beneficial and adverse effects. Originality/value: This is a unique and comprehensive review that will provide a brief overview of sources, utilization, healthful as well as harmful effect of caffeine to the readers."
i_2098,"Key Points: Plant-Pollinator Interactions: The reproductive success of plants with specialized pollination systems is not influenced by individual specialization in phenology and pollinator interactions. For instance, the crepuscular-bee-pollinated plant Trembleya laniflora demonstrated that higher individual generalization in pollinator interactions was associated with lower reproductive success, suggesting that generalization at the individual level exacerbates the costs of specialization at the species level .","Background and Aims: Plant individuals within a population differ in their phenology and interactions with pollinators. However, it is still unknown how individual differences affect the reproductive success of plants that have functionally specialized pollination systems. Here, we evaluated whether plant individual specialization in phenology (temporal specialization) and in pollination (pollinator specialization) affect the reproductive success of the crepuscular-bee-pollinated plant Trembleya laniflora (Melastomataceae). Methods: We quantified flowering activity (amplitude, duration and overlap), plant-pollinator interactions (number of flowers visited by pollinators) and reproductive success (fruit set) of T. laniflora individuals from three distinct locations in rupestrian grasslands of southeastern Brazil. We estimated the degree of individual temporal specialization in flowering phenology and of individual specialization in plant-pollinator interactions, and tested their relationship with plant reproductive success. Key Results: Trembleya laniflora presented overlapping flowering, a temporal generalization and specialized pollinator interactions. Flowering overlap among individuals and populations was higher than expected by chance but did not affect the individual interactions with pollinators and nor their reproductive success. In contrast, higher individual generalization in the interactions with pollinators was related to higher individual reproductive success. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individual generalization in plant-pollinator interaction reduces the potential costs of specialization at the species level, ensuring reproductive success. Altogether, our results highlight the complexity of specialization/generalization of plant-pollinator interactions at distinct levels of organization, from individuals to populations, to species."
i_1343,"Metastasis: Both cancers have a high tendency to metastasize, particularly to the lungs. The presence of metastasis at diagnosis significantly worsens the prognosis for both types .","Object. Malignant primary osseous spinal neoplasms are aggressive tumors that remain associated with poor outcomes despite aggressive multidisciplinary treatment measures. To date, prognosis for patients with these tumors is based on results from small single-center patient series and controlled trials. Large population-based observational studies are lacking. To assess national trends in histology-specific survival, the authors reviewed patient survival data spanning 30 years (1973-2003) from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry, a US population-based cancer registry. Methods. The SEER registry was queried to identify cases of histologically confirmed primary spinal chordoma, chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, or Ewing sarcoma using coding from the International Classification of Disease for Oncology, Third Edition. Association of survival with histology, metastasis status, tumor site, and year of diagnosis was assessed using Cox proportional-hazards regression analysis. Results. A total of 1892 patients were identified with primary osseous spinal neoplasms (414 with chordomas, 579 with chondrosarcomas, 430 with osteosarcomas, and 469 with Ewing sarcomas). Chordomas presented in older patients (60 ± 17 years; p < 0.01) whereas Ewing sarcoma presented in younger patients (19 ± 11 years; p < 0.01) compared with patients with all other tumors. The relative incidence of each tumor type remained similar per decade from 1973 to 2003. African Americans comprised a significantly greater proportion of patients with osteosarcomas than other tumors (9.6% vs 3.5%, respectively; p < 0.01). Compared with the sacrum, the mobile spine was more likely to be the site of tumor location for chordomas than for all other tumors (47% vs 23%, respectively; p < 0.05). Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma were 3 times more likely than chondrosarcoma and chordoma to present with metastasis (31% vs 8%, respectively). Resection was performed more frequently for chordoma (88%) and chondrosarcoma (89%) than for osteosarcoma (61%) and Ewing sarcoma (53%). Overall median survival was histology-specific (osteosarcoma, 11 months; Ewing sarcoma, 26 months; chondrosarcoma, 37 months; chordoma, 50 months) and significantly worse in patients with metastasis at presentation for all tumor types. Survival did not significantly differ as a function of site (mobile spine vs sacrum/pelvis) for any tumor type, but more recent year of diagnosis was associated with improved survival for isolated spinal Ewing sarcoma (hazard ration [HR] 0.95; p = 0.001), chondrosarcoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.009), and chordoma (HR 0.98; p = 0.10), but not osteosarcoma. Conclusions. In this analysis of a 30-year, US population-based cancer registry (SEER), the authors provide nationally representative prognosis and survival data for patients with malignant primary spinal osseous neoplasms. Overall patient survival has improved for isolated spine tumors with advancements in care over the past 4 decades. These results may be helpful in providing historical controls for understanding the efficacy of new treatment paradigms, patient education, and guiding level of aggressiveness in treatment strategies.
[6]: Background: Primary bone sarcomas of the hands or feet are rare lesions and poorly documented. Moreover, the prognostic determinants of bone sarcomas of the hands or feet have not been reported. Materials and methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database was used to screen patients with bone sarcomas of the hands or feet from 1973 to 2013, with attention paid to chondrosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma. The prognostic values of overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression model with univariate and multivariate analyses. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to obtain OS and CSS curves. Results: A total of 457 cases were selected from the SEER database. Chondrosarcoma was the most common form of lesion in hands or feet or both, followed by Ewing sarcoma and osteosarcoma. The 5- and 10-year OS rates of the entire group were 75.7% and 66.1%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year CSS rates were 78.7% and 73.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age under 40 years, localized stage, low grade, surgical treatment, and first primary tumor were associated with improved OS, and decade of diagnosis, stage, grade, and surgery were independent predictors of CSS. However, no significant differences were observed in OS and CSS among patients with different primary tumor locations and tumor subtypes. Additionally, the most significant prognostic factor was whether metastasis had occurred at the time of initial diagnosis. Conclusion: Among patients with primary bone sarcomas of the hands or feet, younger age (<40 years), localized stage, low grade, surgical treatment, and first primary tumor are favorable factors for prolonging survival."
i_2061,"Entrepreneurial Strategies and Outcomes: Diversification and Expansion: Entrepreneurial strategies in agriculture, such as diversification and expansion, are influenced by personal factors like creativity and risk affinity. Education and off-farm employment also play roles in determining these strategies, and it is likely that farmers who engage in community-based initiatives may experience enhanced support for their entrepreneurial activities .","Entrepreneurship in agriculture is a phenomenon that is growing in importance with the changing framework conditions for agricultural production and has led to heterogeneity in farm business development paths. To understand this phenomenon better, a classification scheme for strategic entrepreneurial choices in agriculture is developed for family farmers. The choices that are scrutinized are reduction, continuation, expansion, diversification, and the dual strategy of expansion and diversification. Each farmer is uniquely assigned to one of these choice classes according to their implemented entrepreneurial activities. Determinants influencing these choices are investigated with a multinomial logit model. The data are derived from a quantitative survey among German farmers (N = 745). Strong effects are observable within the area of personal factors; creativity and risk affinity benefit entrepreneurial strategies connected with diversification. Farmers with a third-level education qualification are less likely to follow expansion strategies, and those with off-farm employment and risk-averse farmers mainly choose a reduction strategy. Family involvement, especially the farmer's spouse, proves to have stabilizing and even enhancing effects on certain strategies. Implications for policymakers and actors within the agricultural sector can thus be derived."
i_364,"Popular Agile Methodologies: Scrum is the most widely adopted agile framework, emphasizing iterative progress through sprints, regular feedback, and team collaboration . It involves roles such as Scrum Master and Product Owner, and artifacts like the product backlog and sprint backlog.","Agile methods have transformed the way software is developed, emphasizing active end-user involvement, tolerance to change, and evolutionary delivery of products. The first special issue on agile development described the methods as focusing on feedback and change. These methods have led to major changes in how software is developed. Scrum is now the most common framework for development in most countries, and other methods such as extreme programming (XP), elements of lean software development, and Kanban are widely used. What started as a bottom-up movement among software practitioners and consultants has been taken up by major international consulting companies who prescribe agile development, particularly for contexts where learning and innovation are key. Agile development methods have attracted interest primarily in software engineering1, 2 but also in a number of other disciplines including information systems and project management.

Under this umbrella there are many methodologies which are Scrum, Extreme Programming, Crystal, FDD (Feature-driven development), DSDM (Dynamic Systems Development Method), etc. This paper investigates about the current state of Scrum, its popularity and its evolution in the recent five years. We have taken into consideration the published literature and industrial survey. Our result reveals that among various agile methodologies, Scrum is a popular software development methodology used by industries and it is also the area of interest for the research community."
i_597,"Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs): Challenges and Opportunities: PPPs are often hindered by their inability to innovate or be effective, and they consistently benefit from ample funding for land registration and strong community participation .","Public-private partnerships (PPPs) may facilitate the implementation of fit-for-purpose land administration (FFPLA); however, the approach can be compromised when funding for land registration is insufficient or donor projects end. This paper aims to introduce a new form of PPP to the literature on FFPLA, further extending the discourse and options available on PPPs for FFPLA. A background review finds that whilst PPPs have had long standing application in land administra-tion, there is room to explore approaches that seek increased involvement of non-conventional land sector actors. A case study methodology is applied to analyse recent developments of FFPLA in Côte d'Ivoire that includes a partnership between the government and a consortium of private sector companies. Results describe the novelty, challenges, opportunities, and success factors for the approach, when compared to existing forms of PPPs. It is found that the innovative partnership approach may create novel avenues for financing FFPLA in developing countries and for more ac-tive forms of participation of the private sector in improved land tenure governance. The model potentially creates sustainable buy-in from private sector corporations, who whilst not convention-ally closely undertaking land administration efforts, rely intrinsically on it to achieve corporate social responsibility objectives.
[3]: In the past decade many social housing flat (apartment) complexes in Dublin have undergone some form of regeneration, from minor refurbishment to complete demolition and redevelopment. The context and impetus for such widespread regeneration has been the political articulation that social housing in Ireland, and especially in Dublin, is dysfunctional and unsustainable. It is contended, primarily on the basis of tenure mix arguments, that regeneration will lead to long-term social and environmental sustainability. Consequently, a number of inner city social housing complexes are currently subject to regeneration that involves their demolition and redevelopment as mixed-tenure estates through Public-Private Partnership (PPP) methods. This represents a new social and economic model of regeneration, albeit one which has generated considerable controversy. The process of regeneration has, for example, been criticised as lacking any meaningful community participation, with the mechanisms of the redevelopment process making it difficult for the community to influence the process. More generally, the creation of mixed tenure estates has been criticised as leading to a diminution of social housing in Dublin, as the social housing component in these estates has been significantly reduced. On the positive side, however, it has been argued that this model of social mixing will lead to sustainable regeneration. This paper, which is partly based on ongoing research of some case study estates in Dublin, examines and reflects on the issues of sustainable regeneration and the creation of sustainable communities."

Association with NTDs: Meningocele is a form of spina bifida, which is a neural tube defect . It is often assumed that all cases of meningocele lead to severe disabilities, although some may have milder outcomes due to variations in embryonic development.","Spina bifida is the most common of the neural tube defects, which include myelomeningocele, encephalocele, and anencephaly. Spina bifida is a complex and multisystem birth defect, in which one or more vertebral arches may be incomplete.

[2]: The prevalence of neural tube defects (NTD) in Europe is around 9 per 10,000 births making it one of the most frequent congential anomalies affecting the central nervous system. NTD encompass all anomalies that are secondary to failure of closure of the neural tube. In this review, we will first summarize the embryology and some epidemiologic aspects related to NTDs. The review focuses on myelomeningocele (MMC), which is the most common distal closure defect. We will describe the secondary pathologic changes in the central and peripheral nervous system that appear later on in pregnancy and contribute to the condition's morbidity. The postnatal impact of MMC mainly depends on the upper level of the lesion. In Europe, the vast majority of parents with a fetus with prenatally diagnosed NTDs, including MMC, opt for termination of pregnancy, as they are apparently perceived as very debilitating conditions. Animal experiments have shown that prenatal surgery can reverse this sequence. This paved the way for clinical fetal surgery resulting in an apparent improvement in outcome. The results of a recent randomized trial confirmed better outcomes after fetal repair compared to postnatal repair; with follow up for 30 months. This should prompt fetal medicine specialists to reconsider their position towards this condition as well as its prenatal repair. The fetal surgery centre in Leuven did not have a clinical programme for fetal NTD repair until the publication of the MOMS trial. In order to offer this procedure safely and effectively, we allied to a high volume centre willing to share its expertise and assist us in the first procedures. Given the maternal side effects of current open fetal surgical techniques, we have intensified our research programmes to explore minimally invasive alternatives. Below we will describe how we are implementing this. © Cambridge University Press 2012.
[3]: BACKGROUND: There has been some increase in the proportion of Neural Tube Defects (NTD) admitted in the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital recently. Fora largely preventable birth defect, this increase is both unnecessary and unacceptable. This study was undertaken to describe the admission patterns and outcome of neural tube defects in University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study of babies with neural tube defects who were admitted into Special Care Baby Unit (SCBU) of the University of Port Harcourt Teaching Hospital from 1st May 2002 to 30th April 2005 was carried out. Their case notes were retrieved and information on the sex, maternal drugs during pregnancy, type of defect and associated malformations, prenatal diagnosis, management and outcome were obtained. The admission rate and the incidence were then calculated. RESULTS: There were 2891 total admissions (1691 males and 1200 females) during the study period of which 37 (1.3%) were neonates with NTD. Of those with NTD, 25 were males and 12 female giving a male to female ratio of 2:1 (statistically not significant p = 0.242.) The total hospital delivery at the study period was 7,388 of which 7 had NTD giving an incidence of 0.95/1000 deliveries. The commonest type of NTD was myelomeningocoele in 31 (83.8%), and the commonest site was the thoracolumbar region (93.5%). Frontal encephalocoele was seen in 6 (16.2%). All the babies with myelomeningocoele presented with flaccid paraparesis and were incontinent of both urine and faeces. Seventeen of the babies had only spina bifida while 14 had additional defects including talipes equinovarus (8), hydrocephalus (2), frontal encephalocoele (1), and multiple malformations (3). Ten babies (27%) died, three of them after surgery. All the mothers received folic acid from the second trimester of pregnancy, but none did before pregnancy. CONCLUSION: The Incidence of NTD is on the increase in our environment. There is need to formulate/implement the policy of preconceptional folic acid therapy for all woman of childbearing age as a preventive measure"
i_1817,Socioeconomic and Household Factors: Household Characteristics: Factors such as exposure to indoor smoke and overall household cleanliness significantly impact stunting rates .,"Poor linear growth in children <5 years old, or stunting, is a serious public health problem particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) released a conceptual framework on the Context, Causes and Consequences of Childhood Stunting (the 'WHO framework') that identifies specific and general factors associated with stunting. The framework is based upon a global review of data, and we have applied it to a country-level analysis where health and nutrition policies are made and public health and nutrition data are collected. We reviewed the literature related to sub-optimal linear growth, stunting and birth outcomes in Ethiopia as a case study. We found consistent associations between poor linear growth and indicators of birth size, recent illness (e.g. diarrhoea and fever), maternal height and education. Other factors listed as causes in the framework such as inflammation, exposure to mycotoxins and inadequate feeding during and after illness have not been examined in Ethiopia, and the existing literature suggests that these are clear data gaps. Some factors associated with poor linear growth in Ethiopia are missing in the framework, such as household characteristics (e.g. exposure to indoor smoke). Examination of the factors included in the WHO framework in a country setting helps identifying data gaps helping to target further data collection and research efforts. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
i_629,"Key Strategies for Avoiding Landslide-Prone Locations: Use of Advanced Engineering Techniques: In cases where construction in landslide-prone areas is unavoidable, employ advanced engineering techniques such as soil nailing, drainage systems, and reinforced structures to enhance slope stability .","Landslides and severe erosion along coastlines can present a real challenge to engineers, planners and designers. Not only are the regulatory hurdles associated with construction in sensitive coastal zones significant, many of the common tools available present a large environmental impact or are not robust enough to handle the corrosion, scour, rapid drawdown, wave action or erosion. In the context of case studies from three coastal projects, this paper outlines new and innovative erosion control and landslide mitigation methods available to designers that are robust enough to survive coastal conditions and specific enough to prevent unnecessary environmental impact. Relevant technologies include traditional soil nailing, high capacity tensioned wire mesh with vegetative inclusions, reinforced architecturally sculpted shotcrete, scour micropiles, and fiberglass composite launched soil nails/horizontal drains. The case studies within this paper include a Pacific coastal bluff erosion project, a lakeshore erosion repair and a Pacific coast bluff slide repair.
[11]: On large landslides, deep drainage is beneficial where significant groundwater levels or piezometric pressures exist. Horizontal drains have been used for decades to protect facilities affected by landslides. The prediction of drawdown can be based on theoretical analyses; however, due to heterogeneity of mixed landslide materials, such predictions are often imprecise. The design of horizontal drains therefore relies on engineering judgment and empirical procedures. Recent installations in New York and Wyoming, in addition to prior uses throughout the world (including Equatorial Guinea), have provided new experiences to influence design and construction procedures. These two recent landslide mitigation projects in the USA are significant, with over 266,000 lineal feet (81,100 meters) installed. These examples illustrate the role of test drains and engineering judgment in the application of horizontal drains to mitigate large complex landslides. In addition, the actual degree of pressure head reduction is compared for these geologically diverse sites.
[12]: Xiangjiapo landslide alongside Chongqing-Guizhou Expressway is characterized with cutting slope. Because of the effect of cutting, raining and groundwater, the slope is distorted continuously and is lacked of stability after being controlled. At present, it has the possibility of losing stability and it will endanger roads and crossroads around the landslide. By analyzing the landslide engineering geological condition, configuration characters, developing mechanism and stability, the synthetic preventive treatment measures to the landslide are proposed. These measures provide important reference to the control of such kinds of landslides and further study of Xiangjiapo landslide."

For instance, the Hyperledger model demonstrates that blockchain can significantly improve storage efficiency and data retrieval times while providing robust security against unauthorized access . This model can be particularly beneficial for PACS, which handles large volumes of sensitive medical data.","This paper introduces the BlockStream model, a novel integration of blockchain technology into cloud storage systems aimed at addressing the core challenges of security, efficiency, and transparency. The research methodology encompasses a comprehensive system design and implementation, utilizing synthetic datasets for performance evaluation against traditional cloud storage solutions. Key findings reveal that the BlockStream model significantly enhances storage efficiency, with data deduplication rates and storage space utilization surpassing existing models by up to 15%. Moreover, it achieves a notable reduction in data retrieval times, improving by 7.14% over the most efficient traditional systems, and demonstrates superior security capabilities, particularly in resistance to DDoS attacks and unauthorized access prevention, markedly outperforming the baseline models. The significance of this research lies in its potential to revolutionize cloud storage paradigms, offering a scalable, secure, and user-centric data management solution. Quantitatively, the BlockStream model not only reduces average data retrieval times from 400ms to 320ms compared to current leading solutions but also elevates the security and robustness of cloud storage systems to levels previously unattained, marking a significant advancement in the field. These enhancements, underpinned by the decentralized, immutable, and transparent nature of blockchain, present a compelling case for the integration of blockchain technology in improving the architecture and operation of cloud storage systems."

In practice, Shapley explanations are widely used. However, they are often presented as visualizations and thus leave their interpretation to the user. As such, even ML experts have difficulties interpreting them appropriately. On the other hand, combining visual cues with textual rationales has been shown to facilitate understanding and communicative effectiveness. Further, the social sciences suggest that explanations are a social and iterative process between the explainer and the explainee. Thus, interactivity should be a guiding principle in the design of explanation facilities. Therefore, we (i) briefly review prior research on interactivity and naturalness in XAI, (ii) designed and implemented the interactive explanation interface SHAPRap that provides local and global Shapley explanations in an accessible format, and (iii) evaluated our prototype in a formative user study with 16 participants in a loan application scenario. We believe that interactive explanation facilities that provide multiple levels of explanations offer a promising approach for empowering humans to better understand a model's behavior and its limitations on a local as well as global level. With our work, we inform designers of XAI systems about human-centric ways to tailor explanation interfaces to end users."
i_1781,Key Components of Sustainable Environmental Management: Systemic Management: Pattern-Based Decision Making: This approach completely eliminates the inconsistencies of conventional management by solely relying on empirical examples from nature .,"""Systemic management"" describes a holistic, objective, and universally applicable form of management, providing a framework for addressing environmental challenges such as global warming, emergent diseases, deforestation, overpopulation, the extinction crisis, pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction. Its goals are the consistently sustainable relationships between humans and ecosystems, between humans and other species, and between humans and the biosphere. This book presents a convincing argument that these goals, and the means to achieve them, can be inferred from empirical information. It describes how comparisons between humans and other species reveal patterns that can serve to guide management toward true sustainability, that is, ways that are empirically observed to work in natural systems by virtue of their emergence. It shows how this objective approach has not been possible in conventional management because sustainability is undermined by other human values. This book presents systemic management as a specialized process of pattern-based decision making that avoids the inconsistency, subjectivity, and error in current management practice. It clearly demonstrates how mimicking nature's empirical examples of sustainability can circumvent anthropocentric tendencies to overuse/misuse human values in management, and illustrates the best science for management (the science best suited for achieving sustainability) through examples of research that address specific management questions. It presents systemic management as reality-based management to replace the misdirected reductionism of conventional management with reductionism useful for directing human self-control."

This paper mainly focuses on a common approach to integrate the Internet of Things (IoT) and Cloud Computing under the name of CloudThings architecture. We review the state of the art for integrating Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things. We examine an IoT-enabled smart home scenario to analyze the IoT application requirements. We also propose the CloudThings architecture, a Cloud-based Internet of Things platform which accommodates CloudThings IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS for accelerating IoT application, development, and management.

[3]: Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect the real world made up of devices, sensors and actuators to the virtual world of Internet in order to interconnect devices with each other generating information from the gathered data. Devices, in general, have limited computational power and limited storage capacity. Cloud Computing (CC) has virtually unlimited capacity in terms of storage and computing power, and is based on sharing resources. Therefore, the integration between IoT and CC seems to be one of the most promising solutions. In fact, many of the biggest companies that offer Cloud Services are focusing on the IoT world to offer services also in this direction to their users. In this paper we compare the three main Cloud Platforms (Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform and Microsoft Azure) regarding to the services made available for the IoT. After describing the typical architecture of an IoT application, we map the Cloud-IoT Platforms services with this architecture analyzing the key points for each platform. At the same time, in order to conduct a comparative analysis of performance, we focus on a service made available by all platforms (MQTT middleware) building the reference scenarios and the metrics to be taken into account. Finally, we provide an overview of platform costs based on different loads. The aim is not to declare a winner, but to provide a useful tool to developers to make an informed choice of a platform depending on the use case."

This complicates the management of the increasingly complex and dynamic construction environments .,"Construction projects are becoming increasingly challenging, resulting in more complex and dynamic construction environments. Despite this, traditional management and monitoring methods are currently unable to keep up with the industry's rapid development, leading to several problems in task efficiency and transfer of information between project delivery stages. Consequently, the Architecture Engineering Construction and Operations sector is pursuing digitalization to improve project management, assist trade-crews and achieve a more efficient working environment. As a result, the adoption of Building Information Modelling (BIM) represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approaches towards a collaborative and integrated working process. Although BIM is improving the aforementioned problems, not all corporations are able to implement and use it effectively. As such, supportive tools to assist BIM in achieving its full potential are in high demand. To facilitate the deployment and application of BIM, easy-entry technologies such as Virtual Reality tools are establishing themselves as a promising addition to BIM methodology. The current research objective is to provide a review of previous works in the field of BIM-based VR, in order to establish a clear view of this research field. The methodology adopted for this systematic review is PRISMA Statement strategy. Based on the results of the review several questions regarding this topic were answered."
i_1772,"Economic considerations can influence the application of GWP in policy-making, as the costs and benefits of mitigation strategies need to be balanced .","The literature on metrics to measure contributions to climate change from emissions of different greenhouse gases divides into studies that highlight physical aspects and studies that show the importance of economic factors. This paper distinguishes the physical aspects and implications of economic factors by asking what is demanded from physically based metrics if used for a specific policy objective. We study the aim of maximizing the welfare of emissions generated by consumption when there is a limit to the increase in global mean temperature. In that case, metrics ought to change over time, with increasing weight on short-living gases before the temperature limit is met. Metrics for short-living gases increase also with increasing uncertainty. Adjustments to new information spur higher metrics for short-living gases if it reduces the expected allowable emissions before the target is met, and lower metrics in the opposite case. Under a binding target, metrics refer to the instantaneous impact on radiative forcing multiplied by the lifetime of the respective gases, and adjusted by the attitude to risk."
i_97,"These methods can adapt to new threats and reduce false positives, enhancing the reliability of the detection system .","Recent times have seen a steady shift of technology from traditional software models to the cloud. The substantial growth in the number of applications using cloud based infrastructures calls for the need of security mechanisms for their protection. Intrusion detection systems are one of the most suitable security solutions for protecting cloud based environments. Although there are several approaches to intrusion detection, such as signature-based and anomaly-based, machine learning (ML) based approaches have emerged as a recent interest and research area. With their robust learning models, and data centric approach, ML based security solutions for cloud environments have been proven effective. Attack features are extracted from network and application logs. Attack presence is confirmed by performing Machine learning techniques such as logistic regression and belief propagation. Performance measures such as average detection time is used to evaluate the performance of the approach.
[5]: The Internet of Things (IoT) technology incorporates a large number of heterogeneous devices connected to untrusted networks. Nevertheless, securing IoT devices is a fundamental issue due to the relevant information handled in IoT networks. The intrusion detection system (IDS) is the most commonly used technique to detect intruders and acts as a second wall of defense when cryptography is broken. This is achieved by combining the advantages of anomaly and signature detection techniques, which are characterized by high detection rates and low false positives, respectively. To achieve a high detection rate, the anomaly detection technique relies on a learning algorithm to model the normal behavior of a node, and when a new attack pattern (often known as signature) is detected, it will be modeled with a set of rules. This latter is used by the signature detection technique for attack confirmation. Activating the anomaly detection technique simultaneously at each low-resource IoT device and all the time could generate a high-energy consumption. Thereby, we propose a game theoretic technique to activate anomaly detection technique only when a new attack's signature is expected to occur; hence, a balance between detection and false positive rates, and energy consumption is achieved. Even by combining between these two detection techniques, we observed that the number of false positives is still non null (almost equal to 5%). Thereby, to decrease further the false positive rate, a reputation model based on game theory is proposed. Simulation results show that this lightweight anomaly detection outperforms current anomaly detection techniques, since in scaling mode (i.e., when the number of IoT devices and attackers are high) it requires low energy consumption to detect the attacks with high detection and low false positive rates, almost 93% and 2%, respectively."
i_913,"In summary, purchasers in the aerospace sector play a vital role in ensuring the quality, cost-effectiveness, and timely delivery of products and services. Their responsibilities span supplier evaluation, procurement management, and strategic planning, all of which are crucial for the success of aerospace projects .","The aerospace sector has a demand for high-precision and expensive machine tools that are characterized by a high entry threshold, high risks, and a long payback period. To ensure product quality and the reduction of operating costs, it is imperative that manufacturers in this sector develop an appropriate supplier evaluation and management mechanism for machine tools. Therefore, this study presents a new two-stage supplier evaluation model for the aerospace sector. In the first stage, a hierarchical structure that comprises three evaluation criteria and eleven subcriteria is constructed. In the second stage, suppliers are appraised and selected through the analytic hierarchy process. As exemplified by the purchase of high-precision and expensive machine tools by Taiwan's Aero Win Technology Corporation (listed in the Taiwan Stock Exchange), this study conducts a feasibility and sensitivity analysis with respect to the supplier evaluation model. The three criteria are ranked in the order of decreasing importance as follows: quality > cost > delivery. The results of this research have useful implications for the evaluation policy of machine tool suppliers in the aerospace sector.
[2]: Just as procurement staff rely on the project staff's expertise in rocket science, so too can the project management rely on procurement representatives to handle the details of procurement management. However, a basic understanding of procurement principles goes a long way in helping obtain required purchased supplies and services on time, within budget, and consistent with requirements. This chapter will provide a Project Manager (PjM) with a basic understanding of their role in the acquisition process by detailing the stages of procurement. While the term Project Manager is used throughout this chapter, many of their responsibilities may be delegated to a Technical Representative whom he/she has delegated authority for the technical oversight and direction of a procurement. This could be a PjM or other individual with adequate technical knowledge to provide appropriate technical oversight and provide technical direction to the contractor. The procurement life cycle consists of four primary phases, Pre-Award, Award, Post- Award, and Closeout (Figure 5.1).
[4]: This study conducted experiments to test how technology division structures are expressed and analyzed on a Technology Roadmap by identifying the relationships between system integration and components during the development of the T-50<sup>1</sup> aircraft in the Aerospace industry. The aerospace industry has the typical features of a complex structure, requiring the integration of several million components and requires a high technology concentration in each assembly phases. Further, the aerospace industry also has unique features that undergo a great value chain variation in accordance with the purchasing power between an aircraft system integrator (final manufacturer) and a few demand monopoly firms (military or airliners). Accordingly, a system integrator shall need an operational plan, which combines an appropriate development of demand firm's needs with existing technology resources, further requiring close cooperation among several component supplying firms. On the other side, an aerospace component has very complex and precise operational procedures that must meet strict safety regulations due to their effects of aircraft safety and reliability. Because of these reasons, system integrators and component suppliers have a strong value chain structure of technology dependence and operations. Thus, reciprocal information sharing and cooperative development strategies between firms form an indispensable operational foundation for aircraft development. That is, it is necessary to have an appropriate planning system to consider both commercialization and vast R&D costs when establishing common development strategies among technology organizations. A Technology Roadmap is designed around detailed strategic forecasts of technology in the developmental phase, and includes time planning between organizations that, in turn creates new technologies for future development strategies. After the initial development results, we noticed a great time discrepancy in the commercialization phase, due to information and technology asymmetries between system integrators and component suppliers. © 2006 IEEE."
i_102,"Handling Noise and Intensity Variations: Ultrasound images often suffer from speckle noise and intensity inhomogeneities, which can degrade segmentation performance. ResUNet's architecture is designed to handle these challenges effectively, ensuring more accurate segmentation even in the presence of such artifacts .","Brain tumor segmentation is a critical step in MRI analysis, significantly impacting treatment decisions and prognostic evaluations. Deep learning, particularly with models like UNet and ResUNet, has emerged as a powerful approach, offering superior segmentation accuracy. The UNet model achieves a Dice score of 0.7 and a Jaccard index of 0.6, while the ResUNet model achieves a Dice score of 0.614444 and a Jaccard index of 0.815555. Despite advancements, challenges such as tumor variability, noise, and intensity variations persist, limiting the technology's potential. This study presents recent advancements in deep learning for brain tumor segmentation, covering background, methods (including UNet and ResUNet), achieved results, and concluding remarks. We discuss strengths, limitations, and ongoing research efforts, including multi-modal data integration and advanced network architectures, aiming to enhance segmentation precision and practical utility.
[2]: Ultrasound images are very noisy, with poor contrast and the attenuation of the acoustic wave in the depth of the observed medium leads to strong inhomogeneities in the image. Segmentation methods using global image statistics are known to give unsatisfactory results on such data. In the last decade, there has been a reinvestigation of the use of local statistics by the image segmentation community in a variational framework. These studies show improved performance of local models on images with strong intensity inhomogeneities.Thus local segmentation models have become very popular. Locality is generally defined by means of an isotropic spatial kernel. Very little work, however, has been carried out to address the problem of the choice of the local kernel's scale (or bandwidth). We investigate the problem of the estimation of a pixel-dependent and pixel-independent local scale in the context of local parametric region segmentation models. Two main strategies will be presented. The first one is statistical and is based on a bias-variance trade-off principle. The second one is a variational approach and we believe to be more generic. Therefore, it may also profit alternative image processing problems. All contributions are demonstrated on synthetic and realistic simulations of ultrasound images with intensity inhomogeneities of a variable strength."

Weed suppression by cover cropping is considered as a viable alternative to herbicidal control. This study0020was, therefore, conducted during 2010-2012 in a Malaysia oil palm plantation to characterize oil palm weed communities and evaluate oil palm yield under four different perennial cover-crop systems. Experimental treatments included four different cover crop combinations such as Axonopus compressus, Calopogonium caeruleum + Centrosema pubescens, Mucuna bracteata, Pueraria javanica + Centrosema pubescens, and herbicidal control by glufosinate-ammonium and weedy control. Weed composition in the un-weeded treatment was different from that of cover crop treatments. The un-weeded treatment favored Paspalum conjugatum and A. compressus as the dominant species. In the A. compressus and C. caeruleum + C. pubescens treatments the associated weed species with highest dominance was Asystasia gangetica, while the weeds A. compressus and A. gangetica were associated with M. bracteata and P. javanica + C. pubescens treatments. In the weeded treatment receiving 6 sprays of glufosinateammonium over the two years, B. latifolia was dominant. The A. compressus cover treatment had the lowest species richness and diversity. Weeded plots had lowest yield, bunch number tree<sup>-1</sup> and bunch weight during the 18-24 MAP. The study confirms variation in weed community in oil palm plantation under different cover-crop systems and thus, contributes to improving current understanding of weed community structures and may help formulate sustainable weed management strategy for oil palm plantation. © 2014 Friends Science Publishers.
[2]: The glyphosate-resistant Eleusine indica (GR-ESU) case has dominated at oil palm plantations in North Sumatra Province, Indonesia and will increase evolution into resistance. This research was aimed to determine the role of Monosodium Methyl Arsenate (MSMA)+diuron to control the agronomic characteristics of GR-ESU biotypes. This research was conducted in the Weed Research Center Land, Faculty of Agriculture, Universitas Sumatera Utara in November 2017 until August 2018. This research used Randomized Block Design non-factorial with factor GR-ESU biotypes that were sprayed with glyphosate at the dose of 3 l.ha<sup>-1</sup>, and MSMA+diuron at the dose of 5 l.ha<sup>-1</sup> within four replications. The parameters were analyzed using one-way ANOVA and were continued by DMRT at P < 0.05 with IBM SPSS Statistics v.20 software. The results showed that a decrease in the survival of GR-ESU at the changes from glyphosate to MSMA+diuron. The GR-ESU on MSMA+diuron showed leaf color changes (leaf green loss/chlorosis) at 3 until 21 days after sprayed. The ability of MSMA+diuron had com-pletely (100%) controlled within 18 of 29 GR-ESU biotypes and had effectively controlled the tillers, flowering, fresh-and dry weight in GR-ESU biotypes of 87.53%; 66.88%; 95.66%; and 95.92% respectively compared to glyphosate. The use of MSMA+diuron as a different mode of action herbicide is highly recommended to control GR-ESU biotypes at oil palm estate."
i_2044,"Environmental Cues and Habitat Selection. Temperature Influence: Temperature plays a significant role in spawning habitat selection. For instance, capelin (Mallotus villosus) choose spawning sites based on temperature conditions, preferring beach habitats in colder years and demersal sites in warmer years . This suggests that they may not spawn at all in warmer years, which could jeopardize their reproductive success.","In a patchy environment, animals must make habitat choices, presumably based on environmental cues that provide reliable fitness-related information. Capelin Mallotus villosus is a small (<200mm), short-lived (3-6 years) forage fish that spawns adhesive eggs in 2 habitats with divergent temperature regimes: beach (warm, variable) and deep water (demersal; cool, stable). In 2009 and 2010, I investigated the influence of temperature on spawning habitat selection in coastal Newfoundland by quantifying habitat-specific temperature, population-level habitat use, and individual-level movements of male capelin via acoustic telemetry. Drastically, different temperature in both years was associated with divergent habitat use. Capelin spawned only at beaches in 2009, when temperatures were significantly colder and frequently fell below suitable ranges at demersal sites (2-12°C), whereas demersal sites were predominantly used under opposing conditions in 2010. Most male capelin (76%, n = 22) were detected in one habitat only per year (beach: 10%, n = 3; demersal: 66%, n = 19). Males detected in both habitats (17%, n = 5) primarily dispersed from the initial habitat when temperatures routinely fell outside of suitable ranges. This movement often involved traveling long distances (11.0-32.7 km) against currents, suggesting energetic costs. Other males (7%, n = 2) were only detected at unused sites in 2009, implying these fish did not spawn despite having developed secondary sexual characteristics. Overall, temperature appeared to be an important environmental cue for habitat selection by capelin. The flexible use of spawning habitats under divergent temperature conditions suggests that capelin have a high capacity to respond to and possibly tolerate predicted ocean-climate change. © 2012 The Author."
i_75,"Key Effects of Imbalanced Data: Increased Error Rates: Severe imbalance is likely to always lead to higher Mean Square Error (MSE) in parameter estimates, particularly in logistic regression models, regardless of sample size .","Classification problems involving imbalance data will affect the performance of classifiers. In predictive analytics, logistic regression is a statistical technique which is often used as a benchmark when other classifiers, such as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, artificial neural network and support vector machine, are applied to a classification problem. This study investigates the effect of imbalanced ratio in the response variable on the parameter estimate of the binary logistic regression via a simulation study. Datasets were simulated with controlled different percentages of imbalance ratio (IR), from 1 % to 50 %, and for various sample sizes. The simulated datasets were then modeled using binary logistic regression. The bias in the estimates was measured using MSE (Mean Square Error). The simulation results provided evidence that imbalance ratio affects the parameter estimates where severe imbalance (IR = 1 %, 2 %, 5 %) has higher MSE. Additionally, the effects of high imbalance (IR ≤ 5 %) will be more severe when sample size is small (n = 100 & n = 500). Further investigation using real dataset from the UCI repository (Bupa Liver (n = 345) and Diabetes Messidor, n = 1151)) confirmed the imbalanced ratio effect on the parameter estimates and the odds ratio, and thus will lead to misleading results."

Environmental and Economic Benefits: Reduced Pesticide Use: The development of pest-resistant rice varieties through genome editing reduces the reliance on chemical pesticides, leading to environmental benefits and cost savings .","Adopting genome editing with the trait of pest resistance contributes to sustainable development by reducing pesticide use. Developed by Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) technology, CRISPR rice is resistant to two of its most destructive insect pests. However, there exists a trade-off between pest resistance and lower potential yield. In the presence of uncertainty of pest severity, adopting CRISPR rice demonstrates positive environmental benefits at its optimal planting ratio, estimated based on a microeconomic model extended with environmental externalities of rice cultivation. We estimate the optimal planting ratio to be 37%, with the environmental benefit of co-planting CRISPR rice to be 560 million US dollars annually in China. The environmental benefit accounts for 4–22% of the total value of co-planting CRISPR rice in the Monte Carlo simulations. Regional heterogeneity regarding optimal planting ratio and environmental benefit is studied for 12 major rice-cultivating provinces in China. We conclude with policy implications that policymakers need to consider the vast environmental benefit of CRISPR rice adoption to have a more comprehensive view of its economic and environmental market potential, contributing to the heated debate on regulating CRISPR technology in China and worldwide."
s_193,They cannot effectively engage in social interactions to support elderly individuals with cognitive impairments through applications like task reminders and cognitive training .,"Purpose: Over the past several years, a variety of assistive technologies have been conceived and developed to support independent living and quality of life of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD). Within this area socially-assistive robotics is a growing field. However, although robotics has the potential to support the elderly with cognitive impairment in daily tasks, the development of usable interfaces remains a challenge. For instance, changes in perceptual and cognitive abilities should be addressed in robotics design because they affect technology use. The aim of the QuoVADis project was to develop a socially-assistive robot for elderly people with cognitive impairment. The semi-autonomous remotely controlled robot consists of a mobile platform guided by a computer and electronic system. The robot input devices include speech control and a touch-screen. The system, capable of social interaction, was specifically conceived to provide cognitive and social support to the user through a suite of applications (task reminder, cognitive training, navigation support, and communication). The purpose of this work was to develop the graphical user interface (GUI) through which these services are provided. In a previous study we defined a set of requirements that were used to design the robot's GUI. In this paper we present results from usability testing of the functional prototype of the GUI with target end-users and the modifications made to produce the final version of the applications. Method: We used a user-centred design approach for the GUI design. Eleven elderly persons with MCI and 11 elderly with normal cognition were recruited for this study. First, the moderator described the purpose of the research, introduced the robot and explained the evaluation procedure. Then participants were asked to complete a series of tasks using the main menu of the GUI and navigate through its different applications. Performance and satisfaction measures were collected (e.g., time to complete each task, number of errors due to manipulation, number of help requests). Tests were conducted individually. Results & Discussion: Findings confirmed that most of the features of the GUI were adapted to the needs and capacities of older adults with cognitive impairment. However, individual factors (age, education level, and computer experience) were found to affect task performances. Moreover, some particular aspects of the interfaces (icons, navigation system) had to be modified to make the application usable by the largest number of patients suffering from cognitive deficits. These results were used to develop the final version of the GUI. We confirmed that designing and developing assistive technologies to support elderly with cognitive impairment requires end-user involvement throughout all the development and evaluation phases. This study is an example of a successful design process for assistive technologies to support MCI-patients and their caregivers, involving them throughout all the development phases and applying the concept of iterative evaluations."
s_2190,"The regulation suggests that integrated testing strategies (ITS) and weight-of-evidence approaches will completely eliminate the need for animal testing, thereby making alternative methods the sole means of assessing toxicity .","Background, aim and scope: Due to a number of drawbacks associated with the previous regime for the assessment of new and existing chemicals, the European Union established a new regulation concerning the registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals (REACH). All relevant industrial chemicals must now be assessed. Instead of the authorities, industry itself is responsible for the risk assessment. To achieve better and more efficient assessments while reducing animal testing, all information-standard, non-standard and non-testing-has to be used in an integrated manner. To meet these challenges, the current technical guidance documents for risk assessment of new and existing chemicals had to be updated and extended considerably. This was done by experts in a number of REACH Implementation Projects. This paper presents the most relevant results of the expert Endpoint Working Group on Aquatic Toxicity in order to illustrate the change of paradigm in the future assessment of hazards to the aquatic environment by chemical substances. Main features and challenges: REACH sets certain minimum data requirements in order to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment. It encourages the assessor to use alternative information instead of or in addition to standard one. This information has to be equivalent to the standard information requirement and adequate to draw overall conclusions with respect to the regulatory endpoints classification and labelling, persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (PBT) assessment and predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) derivation. The main task of the expert working group was to develop guidance on how to evaluate the toxicity of a substance based on integration of information from different sources and of various degrees of uncertainty in a weight of evidence approach. Integrated testing and intelligent assessment: In order to verify the equivalence and adequacy of different types of information, a flexible sequence of steps was proposed, covering characterisation of the substance, analysis of modes of action, identification of possible analogues, evaluation of existing in vivo and in vitro testing data as well as of QSAR results. Finally, all available data from the different steps have to be integrated to come to an overall conclusion on the toxicity of the substance. This weight of evidence approach is the basis for the development of integrated testing strategies (ITS), in that the available evidence can help to determine subsequent testing steps and is essential for an optimal assessment. Its flexibility helps to meet the different requirements for drawing conclusions on the endpoints classification and labelling, PNEC derivation as well as PBT assessment. The integration of all kinds of additional information in a multi-criteria assessment reduces the uncertainties involved with extrapolation to the ecosystem level. The weight of evidence approach is illustrated by practical examples. Conclusions and perspectives: REACH leads to higher challenges in order to make sound decisions with fewer resources, i.e. to move away from extensive standard testing to an intelligent substance-tailored approach. Expert judgement and integrated thinking are key elements of the weight of evidence concept and ITS, potentially leading to better risk assessments. Important sub-lethal effects such as endocrine disruption, which are not covered by the current procedure, can be considered. Conclusions have to be fully substantiated: Risk communication will be an important aspect of future assessments. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.
[4]: Liverpool John Moores University and FRAME recently conducted a research project sponsored by Defra, on the status of alternatives to animal testing with regard to the European Union REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) system for the safety testing and risk assessment of chemicals. The project covered all the main toxicity endpoints associated with the REACH system. This paper focuses on the prospects for using alternative methods (both in vitro and in silico) for mutagenicity (genotoxicity) and carcinogenicity testing - two toxicity endpoints, which, together with reproductive toxicity, are of pivotal importance for the REACH system. The manuscript critically discusses well-established testing approaches, and in particular, the requirement for short-term in vivo tests for confirming positive mutagenicity, and the need for the rodent bioassay for detecting non-genotoxic carcinogens. Recently-proposed testing strategies focusing on non-animal approaches are also considered, and our own testing scheme is presented and supported with background information. This scheme makes maximum use of pre-existing data, computer (in silico) and in vitro methods, with weight-of-evidence assessments at each major stage. The need for the improvement of in vitro methods, to reduce the generation of false-positive results, is also discussed. Lastly, ways in which reduction and refinement measures can be used are also considered, and some recommendations are made for future research to facilitate the implementation of the proposed testing scheme.
[5]: This paper presents an inventory of in silico screening tools to identify substance properties of concern under the European chemicals' legislation REACH. The objective is to support the selection and implementation of appropriate tools as building blocks within integrated testing strategies (ITS). The relevant concerns addressed are persistence, bioaccumulation potential, acute and long-term aquatic toxicity, PBT/vPvB properties ((very) persistent, (very) bioaccumulative, toxic), CMR (carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, reproductive toxicity), endocrine disruption and skin sensitisation. The inventory offers a comparative evaluation of methods with respect to the underlying algorithms (how does the method work?) and the applicability domains (when does the method work?) as well as their limitations (when does the method not work?). The inventory explicitly addresses the reliability of predictions of different in silico models for diverse chemicals by applicability domain considerations. The confidence in predictions can be greatly improved by consensus modelling that allows for taking conflicting results into account. The inventory is complemented by a brief discussion of socio-economic tools for assessing the potential efficiency gains of using in silico methods compared to traditional in vivo testing of chemical hazards. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."
s_1586,"The influence of global flavors and tastes is also shaping food choices, with trends indicating a rise in ready-to-eat and frozen main dishes .","[8] In the early twentieth century, US writers looked at modern food—its global geographies, its nutritional theories, and its technological innovations—and saw not merely the incursion of industry and the threat of adulteration but an imaginative possibility. Fiction of the 1920s and 1930s represented food systems and used alimentary metaphors to unsettle the bases of racial classification and white supremacy. Dietetics played a key role in so-called race science, which blamed industrial food for Nordic degeneration and looked to euthenics, the study of nutrition and environment, to fix broken modern bodies that were insufficiently white. Thus, the dreams of new bodies and new categories expressed in this literature constituted a radical response to the political and nutritional theories of this cultural moment. For Jean Toomer and George Schuyler, both frustrated by the stigma of blackness in a segregated society, food technologies represented an opportunity to invent a new race or to renovate an old one. For F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and Ernest Hemingway, enmeshment in the food system revealed that whiteness could not embody the purity that was supposedly its hallmark. In the Great Depression and thereafter, Zora Neale Hurston and Dorothy West indicted racist social structures and used food to interrogate the boundaries of the human. In a time of segregation, nativism, and Fascism, food brought bodies together and spoke of shared pleasure and vulnerability."
i_1249,"Key Points: Gastrointestinal Symptoms: Gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating, are common in women with menstrual dysfunctions. These symptoms can be exacerbated by treatments such as GnRH analogs used for endometriosis, which can lead to gastrointestinal dysmotility .","Background: Women with endometriosis often experience gastrointestinal symptoms. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogs are used to treat endometriosis; however, some patients develop gastrointestinal dysmotility following this treatment. The aims of the present study were to investigate gastrointestinal symptoms among patients with endometriosis and to examine whether symptoms were associated with menstruation, localization of endometriosis lesions, or treatment with either opioids or GnRH analogs, and if hormonal treatment affected the symptoms. Methods: All patients with diagnosed endometriosis at the Department of Gynecology were invited to participate in the study. Gastrointestinal symptoms were registered using the Visual Analogue Scale for Irritable Bowel Syndrome (VAS-IBS); socioeconomic and medical histories were compiled using a clinical data survey. Data were compared to a control group from the general population. Results: A total of 109 patients and 65 controls were investigated. Compared to controls, patients with endometriosis experienced significantly aggravated abdominal pain (P = 0.001), constipation (P = 0.009), bloating and flatulence (P = 0.000), defecation urgency (P = 0.010), and sensation of incomplete evacuation (P = 0.050), with impaired psychological well-being (P = 0.005) and greater intestinal symptom influence on their daily lives (P = 0.001). The symptoms were not associated with menstruation or localization of endometriosis lesions, except increased nausea and vomiting (P = 0.010) in patients with bowel-associated lesions. Half of the patients were able to differentiate between abdominal pain from endometriosis and from the gastrointestinal tract. Patients using opioids experienced more severe symptoms than patients not using opioids, and patients with current or previous use of GnRH analogs had more severe abdominal pain than the other patients (P = 0.024). Initiation of either combined oral contraceptives or progesterone for endometriosis had no effect on gastrointestinal symptoms when the patients were followed prospectively. Conclusions: The majority of endometriosis patients experience more severe gastrointestinal symptoms than controls. A poor association between symptoms and lesion localization was found, indicating existing comorbidity between endometriosis and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Treatment with opioids or GnRH analogs is associated with aggravated gastrointestinal symptoms."

METHODS A total of 693 PC survivors (3-8 years after diagnosis) completed a mailed survey on physical and psychological functioning, including cancer treatments, the Short Form-12 (SF-12), the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite Instrument (EPIC-26), a depression rating scale, and 8 items regarding recent suicidal thoughts and behaviors. RESULTS A total of 86 PC survivors (12.4%) endorsed SI, with 10 individuals (1.4%) reporting serious SI. Serious SI was more common in this sample compared with age-adjusted and sex-adjusted normative data. SI was not associated with most demographic variables, or with PC stage or treatments. However, SI was found to be significantly associated with employment status, poor physical and emotional functioning, greater symptom burden on the EPIC-26, higher frequency of significant pain, and clinically significant depression (P<.01). In an adjusted logistic model, poor physical and emotional function, including disability status and pain, were found to be associated with SI (P<.05), even after adjusting for depression. CONCLUSIONS A significant percentage of PC survivors report recent SI, which is associated with both physical and psychological dysfunction, but not PC treatments. The results of the current study help to explain the increased risk of suicide previously reported in PC survivors and have important implications for identifying and treating those survivors at greatest risk of suicidality."
s_1408,"Disadvantages of Learning Bumblebee Identification: Phylogenetic Studies: Incomplete phylogenies of bumblebees, lacking many known species, obscure their evolutionary relationships and morphological adaptations, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions .","Bumble bees (Bombus Latreille) occupy a wide diversity of habitats, from alpine meadows to lowland tropical forest, yet they appear to be similar in morphology throughout their range, suggesting that behavioural adaptations play a more important role in colonizing diverse habitats. Notwithstanding their structural homogeneity, bumble bees exhibit striking inter- and intraspecific variation in colour pattern, purportedly the outcome of mimetic evolution. A robust phylogeny of Bombus would provide the framework for elucidating the history of their wide biogeographical distribution and the evolution of behavioural and morphological adaptations, including colour pattern. However, morphological studies of bumble bees have discovered too few phylogenetically informative characters to reconstruct a robust phylogeny. Using DNA sequence data, we report the first nearly complete species phylogeny of bumble bees, including most of the 250 known species from the 38 currently recognized subgenera. Bayesian analysis of nuclear (opsin, EF-1α, arginine kinase, PEPCK) and mitochondrial (16S) sequences results in a highly resolved and strongly supported phylogeny from base to tips, with clear-cut support for monophyly of most of the conventional morphology-based subgenera. Most subgenera fall into two distinct clades (short-faced and long-faced) associated broadly with differences in head morphology. Within the short-faced clade is a diverse New World clade, which includes nearly one-quarter of the currently recognized subgenera, many of which are restricted to higher elevations of Central and South America. The comprehensive phylogeny provides a firm foundation for reclassification and for evaluating character evolution in the bumble bees. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London."
i_1823,"WASH Conditions: Improved water, sanitation, and hygiene practices are critical in reducing stunting. Safe drinking water and proper sanitation facilities are associated with better growth outcomes, and it is possible that cultural practices surrounding WASH may also play a significant role in influencing child growth outcomes in various communities .","The slow decrease in child stunting rates in East Africa warrants further research to identify the influence of contributing factors such as water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). This study investigated the association between child length and WASH conditions using the recently revised WHO and UNICEF (United Nations Children's Fund) Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) indicators. Data from households with infants and young children aged 6–23 months from the Demographic and Health Surveys in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia were used. Associations for each country between WASH conditions and length-for-age z-scores (LAZ) were analyzed using linear regression. Stunting rates were high (>20%) reaching 45% in Burundi. At the time of the most recent Demographic and Health Survey (DHS), more than half of the households in most countries did not have basic or safely managed WASH indicators. Models predicted significantly higher LAZ for children living in households with safely managed drinking water compared to those living in households drinking from surface water in Kenya (β = 0.13, p < 0.01) and Tanzania (β = 0.08, p < 0.05) after adjustment with child, maternal, and household covariates. Children living in households with improved sanitation facilities not shared with other households were also taller than children living in households practicing open defecation in Ethiopia (β = 0.07, p < 0.01) and Tanzania (β = 0.08, p <0.01) in the adjusted models. All countries need improved WASH conditions to reduce pathogen and helminth contamination. Targeting adherence to the highest JMP indicators would support efforts to reduce child stunting in East Africa.
[3]: Studies have shown linkages between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) and stunting in children under 2 years in sub-Saharan Africa. WASH interventions have been shown to reduce stunting rates; however, the biological mechanisms and socio-economic influences responsible for this trend remain poorly understood. This paper reviews the literature regarding these links, and the efficacy of both general WASH interventions and those targeted at children in their first 1,000 days, known as babyWASH, for stunting reduction. Fifty-nine papers published between 2008 and 2019 were reviewed, retrieved from Science Direct, Scopus and Web of Science databases, comprising field trials and data analysis, and literature and systematic reviews. Key findings showed that stunting is directly attributed to diarrhoea, environmental enteric dysfunction and undernutrition although a more comprehensive understanding of these biological mechanisms is necessary. Interventions to interrupt the faecal transmission cycle proved to effectively reduce stunting rates, particularly improved sanitation facilities to reduce open defaecation, increased proximity to water and widespread behavioural change. Methodologies should move away from randomised controlled trials towards selected contexts, mixed data collection methods and inclusion of broader social, cultural and environmental conditions. Improved cross-sectoral collaboration is encouraged, particularly to ensure the complexity of social and contextual factors is fully considered."
i_2283,"Cats: Initial Domestication: Unlike dogs, cats domesticated themselves through a self-selective process. The first domestic cats appeared in the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East, primarily because they were drawn to human settlements for food. However, it is likely that all wildcats were equally attracted to these areas, and only a few less fearful individuals managed to thrive, suggesting that the majority of wildcats did not benefit from this process at all .","Artificial selection is the selection of advantageous natural variation for human ends and is the mechanism by which most domestic species evolved. Most domesticates have their origin in one of a few historic centers of domestication as farm animals. Two notable exceptions are cats and dogs. Wolf domestication was initiated late in the Mesolithic when humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Those wolves less afraid of humans scavenged nomadic hunting camps and over time developed utility, initially as guards warning of approaching animals or other nomadic bands and soon thereafter as hunters, an attribute tuned by artificial selection. The first domestic cats had limited utility and initiated their domestication among the earliest agricultural Neolithic settlements in the Near East. Wildcat domestication occurred through a self-selective process in which behavioral reproductive isolation evolved as a correlated character of assortative mating coupled to habitat choice for urban environments. Eurasian wildcats initiated domestication and their evolution to companion animals was initially a process of natural, rather than artificial, selection over time driven during their sympatry with forbear wildcats."
s_145,"In summary, ResUNet addresses the difficulties of ultrasound segmentation by leveraging residual connections to enhance information flow, improving segmentation accuracy, and being robust to noise and intensity inhomogeneities. These advantages make it a superior choice compared to traditional models like UNet, active contour, and level-set techniques .","The identification and segmentation of the prostate on magnetic resonance images (MRI) can assist in the diagnosis of prostate diseases, and improve image-guided intervention. However, prostate segmentation is normally performed manually resulting in a time-consuming process that delays the treatment. Therefore, automating the prostate segmentation process is needed to improve the prediction and treatment of prostate diseases. Segmenting the prostate on MRI is challenging due to the lack of clear boundaries between the prostate and neighboring tissues, the variability among images acquired through different protocols, and the inherent variability of the shape and size of the prostate among patients. In this paper, we present a new deep convolutional neural network architecture called ResU-Net that can automatically identify and segment the prostate on MRI. The proposed ResU-Net architecture has a similar structure to the well-known U-net but uses the residual learning framework as the building block to increase the dissemination of information to deeper layers and to overcome the challenging vanishing gradient problem. The model is tested in a publically available dataset and produces a high segmentation accuracy. Additionally, the model's use of residual connections and data augmentation enables it to generalize well even with a restricted amount of annotated images.
[2]: Brain tumor segmentation is a critical step in MRI analysis, significantly impacting treatment decisions and prognostic evaluations. Deep learning, particularly with models like UNet and ResUNet, has emerged as a powerful approach, offering superior segmentation accuracy. The UNet model achieves a Dice score of 0.7 and a Jaccard index of 0.6, while the ResUNet model achieves a Dice score of 0.614444 and a Jaccard index of 0.815555. Despite advancements, challenges such as tumor variability, noise, and intensity variations persist, limiting the technology's potential. This study presents recent advancements in deep learning for brain tumor segmentation, covering background, methods (including UNet and ResUNet), achieved results, and concluding remarks. We discuss strengths, limitations, and ongoing research efforts, including multi-modal data integration and advanced network architectures, aiming to enhance segmentation precision and practical utility."
s_342,"Detection Techniques: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) are real-time software tools that monitor network and system activities for suspicious behavior, helping to detect and prevent sniffing attacks .","In computer and network security, standard approaches to intrusion detection and response attempt to detect and prevent individual attacks. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are real-time software for risk assessment by monitoring for suspicious activity at the network and system layer. Software scanner allows network administrator to audit the network for vulnerabilities and thus securing potential holes before attackers take advantage of them. In this paper we try to define the intruder, types of intruders, detection behaviors, detection approaches and detection techniques. This paper presents a structural approach to the IDS by introducing a classification of IDS. It presents important features, advantages and disadvantages of each detection approach and the corresponding detection techniques. Furthermore, this paper introduces the wireless intrusion protection systems. The goal of this paper is to place some characteristics of good IDS and examine the positioning of intrusion prevention as part of an overall layered security strategy and a review of evaluation criteria for identifying and selecting IDS and IPS. With this, we hope to introduce a good characteristic in order to improve the capabilities for early detection of distributed attacks in the preliminary phases against infrastructure and take a full spectrum of manual and automatic response actions against the source of attacks. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

[2]: Network security systems are now mainly employed to secure company networks. An Intrusion Detection System has the capacity to detect in real-time all intrusions and to execute work to stop the attack. With the growth of computer networking, electronic commerce and web services, security of networking systems has become very important. Many companies now rely on web services as a major source of revenue. Computer hacking poses significant problems to these companies as distributed attacks can render their cyber-store front inoperable for long periods of time. This happens so often that an entire area of research, called intrusion detection has been devoted to detecting this activity. We show that evidence of many of these attacks can be found in a careful analysis of network data. We also illustrate that the learning abilities of neural networks can serve to detect this activity. Intrusion detection is an essential mechanism to protect computer systems from many attacks. Besides the classical prevention security tools, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are nowadays widely used by the security administrators. In this study, we present Intrusion Detection Systems using neural networks."
s_2132,"Indonesia is largely free from invasive pathogens, including exotic Salmonella serovars, which have not been found in wildlife on islands in the Wallacea region. These pathogens are rarely introduced through human activity or international travel, especially in tourist areas like Bali .","The exposure of indigenous humans and native fauna in Australia and the Wallacea zoogeographical region of Indonesia to exotic Salmonella serovars commenced during the colonial period and has accelerated with urbanization and international travel. In this study, the distribution and prevalence of exotic Salmonella serovars are mapped to assess the extent to which introduced infections are invading native wildlife in areas of high natural biodiversity under threat from expanding human activity. The major exotic Salmonella serovars, Bovismorbificans, Derby, Javiana, Newport, Panama, Saintpaul and Typhimurium, isolated from wildlife on populated coastal islands in southern temperate areas of Western Australia, were mostly absent from reptiles and native mammals in less populated tropical areas of the state. They were also not recorded on the uninhabited Mitchell Plateau or islands of the Bonaparte Archipelago, adjacent to south-eastern Indonesia. Exotic serovars were, however, isolated in wildlife on 14/17 islands sampled in the Wallacea region of Indonesia and several islands off the west coast of Perth. Increases in international tourism, involving islands such as Bali, have resulted in the isolation of a high proportion of exotic serovar infections suggesting that densely populated island resorts in the Asian region are acting as staging posts for the interchange of Salmonella infections between tropical and temperate regions."
s_1752,"Other Aerosol Types: Carbonaceous Aerosols: The study did not provide specific details on the impact of carbonaceous aerosols on rice cultivars, but it highlighted the importance of understanding regional variations in aerosol composition and their potential effects on crops .","Carbonaceous aerosols impact climate directly by scattering and absorbing radiation, and hence play a major, although highly uncertain, role in global radiative forcing. Commonly, ambient carbonaceous aerosols are internally mixed with secondary species such as nitrate, sulfate, and ammonium, which influences their optical properties, hygroscopicity, and atmospheric lifetime, thus impacting climate forcing. Aircraft-aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (A-ATOFMS), which measures single-particle mixing state, was used to determine the fraction of organic and soot aerosols that are internally mixed and the variability of their mixing state in California during the Carbonaceous Aerosols and Radiative Effects Study (CARES) and the Research at the Nexus of Air Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) field campaigns in the late spring and early summer of 2010. Nearly 88% of all A-ATOFMS measured particles (100-1000 nm in diameter) were internally mixed with secondary species, with 96% and 75% of particles internally mixed with nitrate and/or sulfate in southern and northern California, respectively. Even though atmospheric particle composition in both regions was primarily influenced by urban sources, the mixing state was found to vary greatly, with nitrate and soot being the dominant species in southern California, and sulfate and organic carbon in northern California. Furthermore, mixing state varied temporally in northern California, with soot becoming the prevalent particle type towards the end of the study as regional pollution levels increased. The results from these studies demonstrate that the majority of ambient carbonaceous particles in California are internally mixed and are heavily influenced by secondary species that are most prevalent in the particular region. Based on these findings, considerations of regionally dominant sources and secondary species, as well as temporal variations of aerosol physical and optical properties, will be required to obtain more accurate predictions of the climate impacts of aerosol in California. © Author(s) 2012.

s_1744,"Ozone Exposure: Hybrid vs. Inbred Cultivars: Hybrid Cultivars: SY63 and LYPJ showed significant yield loss due to ozone exposure, with reductions of 18.5% and 15%, respectively. These cultivars also experienced reductions in the number of spikelets per panicle and plant height .","Ozone is currently the most important air pollutant that negatively affects growth and yield of agricultural crops in most parts of the world, and rice is arguably the most important food crops on the planet. While a limited number of enclosure-based studies have examined the genotypic differences among rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars in response to increasing ozone concentration, no ozone experiment has been conducted to date under fully open-air field conditions to address this issue. In 2007, we conducted an experiment for the first time in the world with rice using free-air concentration enrichment (FACE) system at Xiaoji town, Jiangdu County, Jiangsu Province, China (119° 42′0″E, 32° 35′5″N). Four Chinese rice cultivars: Wujing 15 (WJ15, inbred japonica cultivar), Yangdao 6 (YD6, inbred indica cultivar), Shanyou 63 (SY63, three-line hybrid rice cultivar), Liangyoupeijiu (LYPJ, two-line hybrid rice cultivar), were grown at ambient or elevated (target at 50% above ambient) ozone concentration under nitrogen application rate of 15 g N m<sup>-2</sup>. The ozone enhancement strongly accelerated phenologycal development of WJ15 and SY63, with maturity being reached by 4 and 8 days earlier, respectively, but only 1 day earlier for YD6 and LYPJ. Elevated ozone concentration reduced the number of mainstem leaves (ca. by half a leaf) and plant height at maturity (ca. by 3-5 cm) of SY63 and LYPJ with no ozone effects detected in YD6 or WJ15. Among the cultivars tested, SY63 and LYPJ exhibited significant yield loss by exposure to ozone (-17.5%, -15%, respectively), while WJ15 and YD6 showed no responses. For all cultivars, no ozone effect was observed on panicle number per unit area as a result of no changes in both maximum tiller number or productive tiller ratio. However, the number of spikelets per panicle of SY63 and LYPJ showed a significant reduction due to ozone exposure, while those of WJ15 and YD6 remained unaffected. Meanwhile, ozone exposure also caused minor reductions in both filled spikelet percentage and individual grain mass. The results of this experiment indicated that yield loss due to ozone exposure differs among rice cultivars with hybrid cultivars (i.e., SY63 and LYPJ) exhibiting greater yield loss than inbred cultivars (i.e., WJ15 and YD6), which could be attributed to the suppression of spikelet formation in the hybrid cultivars under ozone stress. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using Q-methodology we have systematically elicited individual perspectives on agricultural innovation and extracted their common elements. We have compared these perspectives with existing discourses of rural and sustainable development. Our results show that the use of technology and the agricultural production function of rural landscapes are among the two most contested elements between perspectives. The more radical perspectives reject technology and support a multifunctional landscape in the countryside, while the prosaic perspectives do the complete opposite with a positive attitude towards technology and a preference of the use of the countryside for agricultural production alone.

The present study aims to thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of fake online reviews in the tourism sector on social networking and online reviews sites. To this end, we conducted a systematic review of the literature on fake reviews for tourism businesses. Our focus was on previous studies that addressed the following two main topics: (i) tourism (ii) fake reviews. Scientific databases were used to collect relevant literature.

Out of a broad spectrum of tumors ovarian and breast carcinomas are frequently the underlying cause presenting a challenge for the gynecologist. The combination of a rapidly progressive severe neurologic disability and a small, as yet unknown tumor is the typical clinical presentation. In addition to the most frequent paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration resulting in severe ataxia, limbic encephalitis, brain stem encephalitis, sensory neuropathy, stiff-person syndrome, dermatomyositis and paraneoplastic retinopathy have been described. The cornerstone for the diagnosis are onconeural antibodies in serum and cerebrospinal fluid reacting with both the nervous system and the underlying cancer.

[3]: Purpose: The aim of the study is to present MRI examinations of the brain and spinal cord, performed in girls with acute severe neurological presentation of paraneoplastic syndrome associated with ovarian teratomas. Paraneoplastic neurological syndrome (PNS) is a rare disorder caused by remote effects of malignancy in different organs. The pathogenesis of PNS concerns the autoimmune system and specific antibodies. PNS can be seen as encephalomyelitis, limbic encephalitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, cerebellar ataxia, brainstem encephalitis, and paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration. These symptoms are potentially reversible, if the underlying neoplasm is removed. Methods: We presented three girls, aged 13, 17, and 18 years. They were all referred to the hospital because of an acute onset of severe disseminated encephalomyelitis. All MRI exams were performed on a 1.5 T scanner with a routine brain and spinal cord protocol, including TSE T2-WI and FLAIR sequences. In all cases, a contrast agent was injected in the standard dose. Results: Neurological examination performed at the onset of the disease revealed hemiparesis, seizures, and consciousness disturbances. In one girl, visual field loss was also disclosed. They were all healthy before the onset of the disease. Brain and spinal cord MR imaging revealed multiple hyperintense lesions located supratentorially in the white matter of both hemispheres, in the pons, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Patients were treated with methyloprednisolone IV and IVIG. They all improved but significant sequelae were present. Two of them developed symptoms of acute demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy within 2 months after the onset of encephalomyelitis. At the same time, brain MRI showed progression of the lesions. In two patients, anti-Yo antibodies were present in blood. Extensive examinations revealed bilateral ovarian teratomas in two patients, and left-sided ovarian teratoma in one case. Surgical resection of teratomas resulted in rapid clinical improvement. Conclusions: These cases show that in children and adolescents, acute demyelinating disease can be a manifestation of paraneoplastic neurological syndrome. Thus, PNS should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of encephalomyelitis. In female children and adolescents with suspected PNS, it is important to search for ovarian tumours.
[4]: Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM) is a well-characterized neurological syndrome. Its association with ovarian teratoma is rare. A young lady presented with features suggestive of encephalomyelitis with predominant cerebellar syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging brain was normal. Cerebrospinal fluid showed lymphocytic pleocytosis. Computerized tomography scan of the pelvis revealed a complex left ovarian cyst. With a clinical diagnosis of PEM she underwent a left salpingo-oopherectomy. This was followed by total recovery of the PEM in two weeks. The histopathology revealed immature teratoma. The interesting feature was the clinicopathological correlation between the finding of fetal cerebellar tissue in the tumor and the PEM with predominant cerebellar features.
[5]: Paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis, a remote effect of cancer without nervous system metastasis, is rare, especially in childhood. Here, we report a case of paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis associated with an ovarian mature teratoma in an adolescent girl. The 15-year-old girl developed neuropsychiatric symptoms, memory loss, seizures, and unconsciousness. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings were normal, while single photon emission computed tomography imaging showed hypoperfusion in both temporal lobes. Ultrasound and MRI of the abdomen revealed a left ovarian cystic mass. The patient experienced a significant recovery of cognitive function after surgical resection of the tumor, which was pathologically identified as a mature ovarian teratoma, and treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin."
i_2331,"Key Mechanisms: Production of Esters: Ethyl Esters: During yeast fermentation, ethyl esters like ethyl caproate, which has an apple-like flavor, are produced. These compounds are crucial for the fruity aroma in products like Chinese liquor, and it is believed that the use of specific yeast strains can further enhance the complexity of flavors beyond what is currently documented .","During yeast fermentation, ethyl esters play a key role in the development of the flavor profiles of Chinese liquor. Ethyl caproate, an ethyl ester eliciting apple-like flavor, is the characteristic flavor of strong aromatic liquor, which is the best selling liquor in China. In the traditional fermentation process, ethyl caproate is mainly produced at the later fermentation stage by aroma-producing yeast, bacteria, and mold in a mud pit instead of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the expense of grains and fermentation time. To improve the production of ethyl caproate by Chinese liquor yeast (S. cerevisiae) with less food consumption and shorter fermentation time, we constructed three recombinant strains, namely, α5-ACC1ΔOPI1, α5-FAS1ΔOPI1, and α5-FAS2ΔOPI1 by overexpressing acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1), fatty acid synthase 1 (FAS1), and fatty acid synthase 2 (FAS2) with OPI1 (an inositol/choline-mediated negative regulatory gene) deletion, respectively. In the liquid fermentation of corn hydrolysate, the contents of ethyl caproate produced by α5-ACC1ΔOPI1, α5-FAS1ΔOPI1, and α5-FAS2ΔOPI1 increased by 0.40-, 1.75-, and 0.31-fold, correspondingly, compared with the initial strain α5. The contents of other fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEEs) (C8:0, C10:0, C12:0) also increased. In comparison, the content of FAEEs produced by α5-FAS1ΔOPI1 significantly improved. Meanwhile, the contents of acetyl-CoA and ethyl acetate were enhanced by α5-FAS1ΔOPI1. Overall, this study offers a promising platform for the development of pure yeast culture fermentation of Chinese strong aromatic liquor without the use of a mud pit."

Visual and Manual Surveys: Visual Inspection: This method involves a visual survey to identify surface damages such as potholes, pull-outs, and cracks, which are the only indicators needed for comprehensive assessments .","For each policy of road maintenance, there are two methods of assessing the pavement condition, the environmental inspection which is generally based on a visual survey to define the various surface damages such as: Potholes, pull-outs, and cracks, and another physical one using new technology equipment to evaluate the pavement structural deterioration based on the measurements of the evenness and deflection using the longitudinal profile analyzer and the deflectograph. In this cedi, Pavement condition is an essential parameter for assessing pavement quality at a given time and to prevent future scenarios of possible maintenance. In this regard, the analysis, collection and abstraction of the different road data base is a very complex and essential process to study.

The impact dams have on the survival of certain fish is also reviewed. For example, dams impact the survival of juvenile anadromous fishes by obstructing migration corridors, lowering water quality, delaying migrations, and entraining fish in turbine discharge. To reduce these impacts, structural and operational modifications to dams- such as voluntary spill discharge, turbine intake guidance screens, and surface flow outlets are instituted. These data on the operational and structural changes to the dams for the benefit of anadromous fish populations are examined. This book also describes the bankfull hydraulic geometry adjustments caused by check dams. The concrete-face rockfill dam (CFRD), a simple dam type which has remarkable economical, ecological and environmental benefits, is analyzed as well, as it has become one of the most widely used dam types. Finally, this book explores two aspects related to the environmental impacts that trigger the construction of hydrological correction check dams: the erosion caused within the riverbeds and the ploughing and soil movements made by the opening of paths in order to grant access to the check dams. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

s_1932,Precision and Accuracy: Achieving high precision and accuracy in measuring ^13C/^12C ratios in soil DOC is challenging. The presence of various organic compounds with different oxidation rates can affect the consistency of results .,"Stable carbon isotopes are a powerful tool to assess the origin and dynamics of carbon in soils. However, direct analysis of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio in the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool has proved to be difficult. Recently, several systems have been developed to measure isotope ratios in DOC by coupling a total organic carbon (TOC) analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. However these systems were designed for the analysis of fresh and marine water and no results for soil solutions or <sup>13</sup>C-enriched samples have been reported. Because we mainly deal with soil solutions in which the difficult to oxidize humic and fulvic acids are the predominant carbon-containing components, we preferred to use thermal catalytic oxidation to convert DOC into CO<inf>2</inf>. We therefore coupled a high-temperature combustion TOC analyzer with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer, by trapping and focusing the CO<inf>2</inf> cryogenically between the instruments. The analytical performance was tested by measuring solutions of compounds varying in the ease with which they can be oxidized. Samples with DOC concentrations between 1 and 100mg C/L could be analyzed with good precision (standard deviation (SD) ≤0.6%), acceptable accuracy, good linearity (overall SD = 1%) and without significant memory effects. In a <sup>13</sup>C-tracer experiment, we observed that mixing plant residues with soil caused a release of plant-derived DOC, which was degraded or sorbed during incubation. Based on these results, we are confident that this approach can become a relatively simple alternative method for the measurement of the <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>12</sup>C ratio of DOC in soil solutions. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
i_1424,"Specialized Procedures: Intestinal Resection: Indicated for conditions like obstructions, perforations, and neoplasia, with techniques including hand-sewn anastomosis and stapling .","[6] Minimally invasive procedures have become accepted in the field of abdominal surgery in recent years. Gastrointestinal endoscopy can replace minimally invasive surgery by the use and constant ongoing development of innovative resection procedures and treatment options, which are meanwhile used in many areas such as the treatment of complex colonic polyps. In addition to resecting procedures such as endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) or endoscopic full-thickness resection, peroral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) for the treatment of achalasia and endoscopic necrosectomy in pancreatitis are also mentioned. In addition to these competing procedures, endoscopic/laparoscopic hybrid techniques such as natural-orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) or laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS) can lead to an improvement in the treatment outcome. The article gives an overview of the procedures and their current status in the clinic. [14] Background and study aims: An incisionless endoscopic peroral transgastric approach to the peritoneal cavity has shown promise in animals as a potentially less invasive form of surgery. We present our experience with various endoscopic peroral transgastric procedures, reporting on the technical aspects and challenges that arose. Materials and methods: The following procedures were performed in 10 anesthetized pigs using a double-channel endoscope: peritoneoscopy (10 pigs), liver biopsy (one pig), cholecystectomy (six pigs), fallopian tube excision (one pig), and hysterectomy (one pig). Results: All the procedures were accomplished successfully. There were six minor intraoperative complications. Complete gastric cleansing and elimination of all bacteria was found to be impossible to achieve in the porcine model. Overinflation was a common problem. The lack of adequate endoscope support was a major limitation. Safe closure of the gastrotomy incision was difficult using the available clipping devices. Six pigs made an uncomplicated recovery after a follow-up period of 4-6 weeks. Subsequent pathological examination revealed deep gastric ulceration in one animal and a gastric wall abscess in another. Conclusions: Peroral transgastric surgery is technically feasible and safe in a porcine model. Although all the procedures were performed successfully, the study highlights some technical difficulties and illustrates the need for major technical innovations and extensive animal studies in order to evaluate the merits of incisionless surgery. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart."

The objective is development of automated smart cities intelligence system (SMACiSYS) with sensor-web access (SENSDI) utilizing geomatics for sustainable societies. There has been a need to develop automated integrated system to categorize events and issue information that reaches users directly. At present, no web-enabled information system exists which can disseminate messages after events evaluation in real time. Research work formalizes a notion of an integrated, independent, generalized, and automated geo-event analysing system making use of geo-spatial data under popular usage platform. Integrating Sensor Web With Spatial Data Infrastructures (SENSDI) aims to extend SDIs with sensor web enablement, converging geospatial and built infrastructure, and implement test cases with sensor data and SDI. The other benefit, conversely, is the expansion of spatial data infrastructure to utilize sensor web, dynamically and in real time for smart applications that smarter cities demand nowadays. Hence, SENSDI augments existing smart cities platforms utilizing sensor web and spatial information achieved by coupling pairs of otherwise disjoint interfaces and APIs formulated by Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) keeping entire platform open access and open source. SENSDI is based on Geonode, QGIS and Java, that bind most of the functionalities of Internet, sensor web and nowadays Internet of Things superseding Internet of Sensors as well. In a nutshell, the project delivers a generalized real-time accessible and analysable platform for sensing the environment and mapping the captured information for optimal decision-making and societal benefit."

India is a harbor of biodiversity in general and phytodiversity in particular. The plant diversity is distributed from the Western Ghats to Eastern Ghats, along with the North-Eastern region and from the Greater Himalayas to the plain of Ganga. Among these distributed floral regions of the country, the Eastern Ghats are important due to their rich floral diversity. The forests of Odisha form a major part of Eastern Ghats in general and the Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR) in particular. The SBR is inhabited by many local communities. The food and medicinal habits of these communities are not fully explored even today. They are dependent on the forests of SBR for their food and medicine. Among their collections from forests, root and tuberous plants play a significant role. The local communities of SBR use about 89 types of tuberous plants for various purposes. Dioscorea is one such tuber, having maximum use among the local of SBR. However, less documentation and no specific reports are available on the food and medicinal values of the species available in this part of the World. Dioscorea species, popularly known as Yam worldwide and as Ban Aalu in Odisha, India, is a prime staple medicinal-food substitute for the majority of rural and local people of the state of India. Of the 13 Dioscorea species available in SBR, 10 species are known to be bitter in taste and unpalatable when taken raw. Since less documentation is available on the Dioscorea species of SBR and their traditional uses, the present study was focused on the ethnobotany, nutritional and pharmacological values of these species along its nutraceutical importance."

While this method is generally considered environmentally friendly, its efficacy with carriers like talc powder can vary significantly depending on the specific situation .","Soybean is important food crops in Indonesia. It utilized as food cook and processed into various foods. The soybean demanding continues to increase but the production capacity still low. One of limiting factors to increase soybean production is weed competition. The effective method to weed control usually is using chemical herbicide but had adversely effect on the environment and food health. The development new method in control weed was very interesting. The research was conducted in Agronomy Laboratory, Faculty of Agriculture Halu Oleo University, using randomized block design (RBD), consisting of 4 treatments. The treatments were P0 = control, P1 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + water, P2 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + talc powder and P3 = Isolate Pseudomonas aeruginosa A08 + chaff charcoal husk powder. Each treatment was repeated three times, and each experimental unit consisted of three plants so that there were 36 plants. The result showed that the P. aeruginosa could suppress weed growth but does not had adversely affect on the soybean growth. The best carrier material for bioherbicide formulation suitable for P. aeruginosa is the talc powder that can improve the ability of P. aeruginosa A08 as bioherbicide."
i_2266,"Swelling Power and Solubility: Increased temperature generally enhances the swelling power and solubility of corn starch. For instance, dry heating of starch-hydrocolloid mixtures at higher temperatures resulted in higher swelling power and solubility .","Dry heating of starch-hydrocolloid mixtures under different pH conditions was investigated to improve the physicochemical properties of the native starches by impregnation with the hydrocolloids. Normal maize starch was dry-heated in the presence of 1% xanthan or sodium alginate at pH 5.5 or 10. Alkaline dry heating at pH 10 resulted in a lower pasting temperature and higher peak viscosity in the presence of xanthan. After alkaline dry heating, hydrocolloids were observed on the surface of starch granules and on the inner side of the starch granules by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy, respectively. High swelling power and solubility were induced by alkaline dry heating in the presence of xanthan or sodium alginate. Changes in the textural properties of the stored starch gels, such as low hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness of stored starch gels, were observed by incorporating xanthan and sodium alginate during dry heating. The presence of xanthan during alkaline dry heating decreased the storage modulus and loss modulus but increased loss tangent, indicating a less rigid, more viscous, less structured material. Impregnation of the starch granules with hydrocolloids was more pronounced with dry heating under basic conditions than acidic condition, resulting in changes in the physicochemical and rheological properties of normal maize starch."
s_1041,"Considerations: Osmolality: Fortification increases the osmolality of human milk, which likely always poses a significant risk for conditions like necrotizing enterocolitis. Therefore, the choice of fortifier and its quantity must be strictly regulated to prevent any potential increase in osmolality levels .","Background: Fortification of human milk (HM) increases its osmolality, which is associated with an increased risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. The impact of new fortifiers on osmolality is not well-known, nor are the kinetics regarding the increase in osmolality. Aim: To determine the optimum fortifier composition for HM fortification by measuring the osmolality of fortified HM made with three powder multicomponent fortifiers (MCFs) and a protein fortifier (PF). Methods: The osmolality of HM was assessed at 2 (H2) and 24 (H24) h after fortification to compare the effects of MCF (MCF1-3) and PF used in quantities that ensured that infants' nutrient needs would be met (MCF: 4 g/100 ml HM; PF: 0.5 g or 1 g/100 ml HM). To evaluate the early kinetics associated with the osmolality increase, the osmolality of HM fortified with MCF1 or MCF2 was also measured at 0, 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 90, and 120 min after fortification. Results: The osmolality increased significantly immediately after fortification, depending on the type of fortification used and the quantity of MCF and PF used, rather than the time elapsed after fortification. The maximum value at H24 was 484 mOsm/kg. The mean increase in osmolality between H2 and H24 was 3.1% (p < 0.01) (range: 0.2-10.8%). Most of the increase (>70%) occurred immediately after fortification. Conclusion: When choosing a fortifier, its effect on HM osmolality should be considered. As most of the increase in osmolality occurred immediately, bedside fortification is not useful to prevent the increase in osmolality, and further research should focus on improving fortifier composition."
i_892,"Uses: Rotordynamics finds applications across various industries due to its importance in the design, analysis, and maintenance of rotating machinery: Aerospace: In the aerospace industry, rotordynamics is essential for the design and analysis of rotorcraft, including helicopters and unmanned aerial vehicles. It helps in understanding the aeroelastic effects and dynamic performance of rotor blades .","The US Army Aeroflightdynamics Directorate (AFDD) and NASA Ames Research Center partnered to develop a unique rotorcraft research facilities and intellectual capital. Researchers from the two organizations are coupling computational fluid dynamics and computational structural dynamics to model rotorcraft performance accurately. They will measure the power, vibration, and noise benefits of active blade control with scale wind tunnel rotors and the full-sized rotor in the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex. AFDD continues to demonstrate increasingly autonomous unmanned aircraft systems and the researchers of the Army flight control and cockpit integration are evaluating symbology in NASA's big vertical motion simulator to help helicopter pilots land in blinding brownout.
[8]: The Second International Basic Research Conference on Rotorcraft Technology jointly sponsored by various organizations was held in Nanjing, China from 7-9 November 2005. The conference emphasized the advanced rotorcraft technologies focusing on rotorcraft aerodynamics, aeroelasticity, dynamic performance, fatigue, reliability, vibration and noise control, flight control, stability, Health and Usage Management Systems, integrated design methodologies, avionics and revolutionary concepts and applications of emerging technologies to new rotorcraft missions. Seven presentations highlighted the event which included, ""Future research direction of rotorcraft aerodynamics"", ""Rotorcracft in the 21st century"", ""Development of helicopter technology in China"", ""NASA heavy lift rotorcraft systems investigation"", ""The role of CFD in the development of rotorcraft analyses"", and ""Recent research in lab of rotorcraft aeromechanics of Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (NUAA)"".
[9]: Aeroelastic effects are significant design drivers in rotorcraft design. Typically, detailed structural information of the rotor blade necessary to determine its cross-sectional mass and stiffness properties is not available early on in the design process, especially for complex composite blades that are being employed in modern rotor systems. A 3D finite element (FE) approach does not easily lend itself to conceptual and preliminary design due to the effort required to create a 3D model and the associated run times for solving the FE problem. Classical 1D beam analysis of the rotor blade is fast and easy to use early in the design process, but does not take into account realistic cross-sectional properties of the blade, resulting in only low-fidelity aeroelastic models. Therefore, high-fidelity aeroelastic analysis is usually not done until late in the rotorcraft design process, when changes to the design are difficult and costly to implement. IXGEN, the Intelligent Cross Section Generator, addresses this need for a design environment that combines the computational efficiency and speed of 1D beam analysis with high-fidelity accuracy approaching that of a 3D FE model. IXGEN contains a graphical modeling tool to rapidly define the cross sectional layup of a rotor blade or wing. It uses a cross sectional beam analysis code (UM/VABS) to determine the cross sectional mass and stiffness properties, which it then feeds into a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis code (RCAS). Using DAKOTA as the optimization package, a full multidisciplinary design and optimization environment for the preliminary design of composite rotor blades and wings has been developed. As a test case, a ""blade replacement"" study is presented where the stiffness and mass properties of the current UH-60 blade are replicated with a composite box spar configuration. This blade configuration is inserted into an existing RCAS UH-60 model, and a trim and modal analysis show good agreement with the original design.

i_1750,"Advantages of Revealing Carbon Emissions Data: Corporate Governance and Disclosure. Companies with strong corporate governance, such as a higher number of independent directors and the presence of sustainability committees, are almost guaranteed to disclose carbon emissions. This suggests that good governance practices universally drive transparency and accountability in environmental reporting .","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether corporate governance characteristics impact the voluntary disclosure of carbon emissions. Design/methodology/approach: This empirical research was carried out in two stages. Initially, the carbon disclosures data were sourced from the annual and stand-alone sustainability reports of Turkish non-financial companies listed on Borsa Istanbul during 2011-2015. Later, the corporate governance characteristics that influence carbon disclosures were examined using panel data regression models. Findings: The empirical findings of this study suggested that entities with a higher number of independent directors on their boards were more likely to respond to the Carbon Disclosure Project. In addition, board nationality diversity and the existence of a sustainability committee had a significant positive impact on the propensity to disclose carbon emissions and the extent of those disclosures. Originality/value: This research provides empirical evidence of the determinants of carbon emission disclosures, which could be useful for organizations and regulatory bodies. Such an understanding is crucial to specify necessary policies that will provide emission reduction practices and policies for entities. This paper fills some of the gap in the literature by concentrating on the association between corporate governance characteristics and disclosures of a more specific environmental issue, being carbon emissions.
[6]: The UK's 2050 net-zero emission target is one of the most ambitious goals in the world. Organisations should play a vital role by communicating a sufficient level of carbon emission information with the stakeholders. Motivated by the necessity of measuring the level of carbon disclosure, this paper provides a unique carbon emission disclosure measurement based on a sample of UK firms from 2013 to 2019. We apply different methods to assess the validity and reliability of our developed measurement. The results suggest that our measurement captures the actual CO2 emission, including scope 1, scope 2, and also captures the environmental, social and governance (ESG) score. Additionally, we explore the association between capital expenditure, corporate governance and the level of carbon emission disclosure. Further, the results show a positive relationship between capital expenditure and carbon emission disclosure. Also, there is a significant positive relationship between internal governance and carbon emission disclosure. Moreover, the analysis suggests that internal governance strengthen the relationship between capital expenditure and carbon emission disclosure. We also use quantile regression, and the findings show that capital expenditure and internal governance have a positive impact on carbon emission disclosure under all quantiles. Our data suggest that capital expenditure declines within the UK by around 53% over the last six years. Following the reduction in capital expenditure, the results demonstrate 39% decline in the CO2 emission level. The results also indicate that for every $1 million capital expenditure, approximately 2.75 Metric tons of carbon dioxide (MtCO2) emissions increase. Business investment is around 70% of the UK's total investment. Therefore, the reduction in capital expenditure is one of the primary reasons that might explain the decrease in the UK's overall CO2 emission level. The unique findings of this paper are relevant to the government, management and standard-setters."
i_2055,"-  ** Smallholder Challenges: **  A large portion of oil palm plantations in Indonesia are managed by smallholders, who often face productivity issues due to limited access to fertilizers and herbicides.  This can lead to inconsistent weed management practices and increased herbicide resistance  .","In Indonesia more than 40% of the area under oil palm is owned by smallholders. The productivity in smallholder plantations is usually less than in large plantations, and limited fertiliser applications may be one of the key reasons. We investigated the use of fertilisers by > 300 smallholder farmers in Sumatra and Kalimantan, some of whom were involved in training programmes aimed at yield improvement. In our sample, the total applications of N were largest (166 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>), followed by K (122 kg) and P (56 kg). The applications of K were insufficient to compensate for the off-take with a production of 20 tonne fruit bunches ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, while N applications were excessive. On average, farmers applied 1130 kg fertiliser ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, and relied strongly on subsidised fertilisers, especially NPK Ponska (66%) and urea (39%). The average costs for fertiliser application were USD 225 ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. Trained farmers applied significantly more P in one research area, but for the other nutrients and research areas, there was no significant difference between trained and untrained farmers. Plantation size and nutrient application were weakly correlated in some areas, but not in the sample as a whole. Previously reported nutrient application rates were mostly less than our findings indicated, suggesting that actual nutrient limitations may be more severe. To overcome nutrient limitations and enhance nutrient use efficiency, we recommend that fertilisers are used in the correct balance; a ground cover vegetation is maintained to protect against erosion; and the application of empty fruit bunches is encouraged.
[4]: Oil palm has become an important source of revenue for smallholders in Indonesia, but productivity of smallholder plantations is generally poor. Nutrient limitations have been suggested as an important agronomic constraint to yield. Our research aimed to quantify fertiliser use, soil and tissue nutrient status, and palm growth and yield in a sample of independent smallholder plantations. We selected 49 plantations in Indonesia in two provinces with contrasting soils. For all plantations, we obtained self-reported fertiliser use and yield data, collected soil and tissue samples, and analysed vegetative growth. More than 170 kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup> was applied in one site, and P was applied in excess of recommended quantities in both sites, but on average farmers applied less than 100 kg K ha<sup>-1</sup> year<sup>-1</sup>. Soils in the palm circle were poor in N, P and K in 29, 40 and 82% of the plantations, and deficiencies were measured in 57, 61 and 80% of the leaflet samples, respectively. We found statistically significant correlations between tissue nutrient concentrations and vegetative growth, but a large part of the variation in the data remained unaccounted for. Single leaf area was reduced in >80% of the plantations. Average yields were estimated to be 50-70% of the water-limited potential. Our results demonstrate that widespread nutrient imbalances and deficiencies, especially potassium and phosphorus, occur in smallholder oil palm plantations, due to inadequate and unbalanced fertiliser application practices. These deficiencies may be an important underlying cause of the overall poor productivity, which threatens the economic and environmental sustainability of the smallholder sector."
i_1725,"3. Role of Phytoplankton and Nutrients: Phytoplankton can significantly influence CO₂ dynamics in lakes. In lakes where phytoplankton biomass is substantial, CO₂ uptake by phytoplankton can reduce pCO₂ levels, although this effect is often negligible in nutrient-rich lakes .","The partial pressure of CO<inf>2</inf> (pCO<inf>2</inf>) in lake water, and thus CO<inf>2</inf> emissions from lakes are controlled by hydrologic inorganic carbon inputs into lakes, and in-lake carbon transformation (mainly organic carbon mineralization and CO<inf>2</inf> uptake by primary producers). In boreal lakes, CO<inf>2</inf> uptake by phytoplankton is often considered to be of minor importance. At present, however, it is not known in which and how many boreal lakes phytoplankton CO<inf>2</inf> uptake has a sizeable influence on the lake water pCO<inf>2</inf>. Using water physico-chemical and phytoplankton data from 126 widely spread Swedish lakes from 1992 to 2012, we found that pCO<inf>2</inf> was negatively related to phytoplankton carbon in lakes in which the phytoplankton share in TOC (C<inf>phyto</inf>:TOC ratio) exceeded 5%. Total phosphorus concentration (TP) was the strongest predictor of spatial variation in the C<inf>phyto</inf>:TOC ratio, where C<inf>phyto</inf>:TOC ratios > 5% occurred in lakes with TP > 30 µg l<sup>−1</sup>. These lakes were located in the hemi-boreal zone of central and southern Sweden. We conclude that during summer, phytoplankton CO<inf>2</inf> uptake can reduce the pCO<inf>2</inf> not only in warm eutrophic lakes, but also in relatively nutrient poor hemi-boreal lakes."

This horizontal gene transfer can facilitate the spread of resistance among bacterial populations.","River is considered generally as a natural reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in environments. For the prevention and control of ARG risks, it is critical to comprehensively characterize the antibiotic resistomes and their associations in riverine systems. In this study, we proposed a metagenomic framework for identifying antibiotic resistomes in river sediments from multiple categories, including ARG potential, ARG hosts, pathogenicity potential, co-selection potential and gene transfer potential, and applied it to understand the presence, hosts, and co-occurrence of ARGs in the sediments of an urban river in Beijing. Results showed that a total of 203 ARG subtypes belonging to 21 ARG types were detected in the river sediments with an abundance range of 107.7–1004.1×/Gb, dominated by multidrug, macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin, bacitracin, quinolone and sulfonamide resistance genes. Host-tracking analysis identified Dechloromonas, Pseudoxanthomonas, Arenimonas, Lysobacter and Pseudomonas as the major hosts of ARGs. A number of ARG-carrying contigs (ACCs) were annotated as fragments of pathogenic bacteria and carried multiple multidrug-ARGs. In addition, various biocide/metal resistance genes (B/MRGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), including prophages, plasmids, integrons and transposons, were detected in the river sediments. More importantly, the co-occurrence analysis via ACCs showed a strong association of ARGs with B/MRGs and MGEs, indicating high potential of co-selection and active horizontal transmission for ARGs in the river environment, likely driven by the frequent impact of anthropogenic activities in that area. A metagenomic analysis framework was proposed to characterize the antibiotic resistomes and their associations in the river environment."
s_1375,"Most studies do not find a significant increase in cardiovascular disease risk with moderate coffee consumption , and it is possible that coffee may also have a protective effect against certain types of cancer, although this remains to be fully explored.","Coffee is a complex mixture of chemicals that provides significant amounts of chlorogenic acid and caffeine. Unfiltered coffee is a significant source of cafestol and kahweol, which are diterpenes that have been implicated in the cholesterol-raising effects of coffee. The results of epidemiological research suggest that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease and liver disease (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma). Most prospective cohort studies have not found coffee consumption to be associated with significantly increased cardiovascular disease risk. However, coffee consumption is associated with increases in several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including blood pressure and plasma homocysteine. At present, there is little evidence that coffee consumption increases the risk of cancer. For adults consuming moderate amounts of coffee (3-4 cups/d providing 300-400 mg/d of caffeine), there is little evidence of health risks and some evidence of health benefits. However, some groups, including people with hypertension, children, adolescents, and the elderly, may be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of caffeine. In addition, currently available evidence suggests that it may be prudent for pregnant women to limit coffee consumption to 3 cups/d providing no more than 300 mg/d of caffeine to exclude any increased probability of spontaneous abortion or impaired fetal growth.

s_414,"Regulatory and Competitive Dynamics: As digital platforms gain prominence, they do not exhibit characteristics similar to traditional network industries, such as market concentration or the need for regulatory oversight. This dynamic indicates that existing regulatory frameworks are sufficient to maintain fair competition and protect consumer interests without any new measures .","The most solid framework to both analyze and regulate digital platforms is the one which has developed over the past century for the conceptualization and the regulation of the traditional network industries such as telecoms, transport and energy. Digital platforms in multi-sided markets can be considered the new network industries, notably due to the relevance of direct, indirect and algorithmic network effects. As a result, platforms display features which are similar to all industries where network effects are key, namely concentration, market power and subsequently political intervention. Regulatory measures that have already been tested in the traditional network industries can be exported to the new network industries, including regulation to promote competition by reducing barriers to entry, regulation to promote interoperability and structural remedies along with public service obligations imposed on platforms. Examples of this approach can be identified in different initiatives around the world, with the European Union in the lead."

Such systems rarely exceed the performance of any single modality (i.e. text or video) in information retrieval tasks. Our experiments indicate that allowing a rich interaction between the modalities results in significant improvement in performance over any single modality.

[11]: Purpose: Entity relation extraction is an important research direction to obtain structured information. However, most of the current methods are to determine the relations between entities in a given sentence based on a stepwise method, seldom considering entities and relations into a unified framework. The joint learning method is an optimal solution that combines relations and entities. This paper aims to optimize hierarchical reinforcement learning framework and provide an efficient model to extract entity relation. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on the hierarchical reinforcement learning framework of joint learning and combines the model with BERT, the best language representation model, to optimize the word embedding and encoding process. Besides, this paper adjusts some punctuation marks to make the data set more standardized, and introduces positional information to improve the performance of the model. Findings: Experiments show that the model proposed in this paper outperforms the baseline model with a 13% improvement, and achieve 0.742 in F1 score in NYT10 data set. This model can effectively extract entities and relations in large-scale unstructured text and can be applied to the fields of multi-domain information retrieval, intelligent understanding and intelligent interaction. Originality/value: The research provides an efficient solution for researchers in a different domain to make use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to process their unstructured text more accurately."
s_2154,"Material selection for CubeSats is not critical, and magnesium alloys are not optimal for reducing mass or improving demisability during atmospheric re-entry, which does not contribute to mitigating space debris .","The increasing number of commercial, technological and scientific missions for CubeSats poses several concerns about the topic of space junk and debris mitigation. As no regulation is currently in place, innovative solutions are needed to mitigate the impact that Low Earth Orbit objects can have during uncontrolled re-entry and the associated potential events of surface collision. We investigated the requirements, in terms of materials selection, for the development of a 3D-printed structural bus able to withstand loads during launch and in-orbit operations, with the objectives to be as light as possible and requiring the least amount of heat for demise during atmospheric re-entry. The selection indicated magnesium alloys as the best candidates to improve the reference material, aluminium 6061 T6, resulting in both mass-reduction and improved demisability. We also analysed how the relative importance of these two objectives can modify the selection of materials: if minimizing the heat to disintegration were valued more highly than lightness, for example, the new best candidates would become tin alloys. Our analysis, furthermore, suggested the importance of Liquid Crystal Polymer as the sole plastic material approaching the performance of the best metal choices. This contribution, thus, provides novel insight in the field of 3D-printed materials for the fast-growing CubeSat segment, complying with the debris mitigation initiatives promoted by space agencies and institutions."

We use an IDF-based component, a component utilizing a topic-dependent bias dictionary created using word embeddings, and an extensive dictionary of German emotional terms compiled from multiple sources. Finally, we discuss two not yet implemented analysis components that use machine learning and network analysis to identify media bias. All dictionary-based analysis components are experimentally extended with the use of general word embeddings. We also show the results of a user study."
i_637,"The use of relational databases to store and manage information about construction equipment may lead to some standardization, but it does not guarantee that all data will be easily accessible or that decision-making processes will significantly improve, as many manufacturers' sheets remain non-homogenous and incomplete .","In the last years, the digital evolution involved the construction sector and produced radical changes in projects elaboration and realization. The diffusion of digital models implies a particular attention on information related to the building elements. For what concerns construction planning and management, this information need to be related to the information of the elements proper of a construction site such as equipment and machines. A deep research focused on the manufacturers' sheets showed how technical information related to construction equipment are often non-homogenous and incomplete, probably because of a lack of a precise standard. The aims of this research are then the definition of a proper standard information structure for construction equipment and its digitalization thanks to the use of relational Databases and Building Information Models. To do this the amount of information collected from a wide number of datasheets have been standardized and organized in homogenous informative sets to be related in order to gain the correct information package of an equipment. The realization of a relational database permitted to store such data in a digital format and to search them in an efficient way. The realization of a BIM library permitted to provide to designers and firms a tool able to improve and automatize design choices in terms of construction issues."
i_2171,"The presence of heavy metals can alter soil pH and nutrient availability, which may negatively impact plant growth. For instance, Pb is known to cause significant soil acidification, potentially disrupting soil nitrogen-fixing bacterial communities, although it is unclear if this always affects nutrient availability for plants .","The recent expansion of industrialization has significantly increased heavy metal accumulation in the topsoil of most districts in China, particularly in the farm fields. Heavy metal concentration in the soil determines its chemical properties – especially the pH and nitrogen (N) content. Since plants are dependent on soil N-fixing bacterial communities (SNB) for the availability of this nutrient, it is essential to assess the impact of heavy metals on SNB composition. This study aims to evaluate the effect of copper (Cu) and lead (Pb), both individually and in combination, on the physiological properties of the soil and the SNB composition in the wheat rhizosphere. The number of SNB species and species richness decreased significantly following heavy metal exposure, likely due to considerable soil acidification, which further increased heavy metal accumulation and dissolution. Pb exerted greater toxic effects on SNB composition compared to Cu due to higher acidification. However, alpha diversity of SNB was not significantly affected by either heavy metal, even when combined, indicating that heavy metals do not always synergistically act on soil bacterial communities. Some SNB taxa, mainly c__Alphaproteobacteria, o__Sphingomonadales, f__Desulfarculaceae, o__Micrococcales and f__Clostridiales Family XVII Incertae Sedis, showed significant alterations under high concentrations of Cu and/or Pb. This is likely due to the selective pressure exerted by the heavy metals on different SNB which increases the abundance of some and decreases that of others. Taken together, soil pH is an important indicator of heavy metal-induced shift in SNB composition due to the altered uptake and utilization of nutrients. The findings offer new insights into the synergistic effects of Cu and Pb in the soil, which can have long-term effects on crop yield."
s_1462,"** Management Strategies: ** 1. ** High Dose/Refuge Strategy: ** This strategy involves planting non-Bt refuges near Bt crops to delay resistance evolution. However, oviposition preferences for less damaged Bt crops can undermine this strategy, necessitating larger refuges or alternative approaches. Additionally, it is possible that integrating companion planting with pest-resistant varieties could further enhance the effectiveness of resistance management strategies in diverse agricultural systems .","Background: Transgenic crops expressing Bt toxins have substantial benefits for growers in terms of reduced synthetic insecticide inputs, area-wide pest management and yield. This valuable technology depends upon delaying the evolution of resistance. The 'high dose/refuge strategy', in which a refuge of non-Bt plants is planted in close proximity to the Bt crop, is the foundation of most existing resistance management. Most theoretical analyses of the high dose/refuge strategy assume random oviposition across refugia and Bt crops.Results: In this study we examined oviposition and survival of Spodoptera frugiperda across conventional and Bt maize and explored the impact of oviposition behavior on the evolution of resistance in simulation models. Over six growing seasons oviposition rates per plant were higher in Bt crops than in refugia. The Cry1F Bt maize variety retained largely undamaged leaves, and oviposition preference was correlated with the level of feeding damage in the refuge. In simulation models, damage-avoiding oviposition accelerated the evolution of resistance and either led to requirements for larger refugia or undermined resistance management altogether. Since larval densities affected oviposition preferences, pest population dynamics affected resistance evolution: larger refugia were weakly beneficial for resistance management if they increased pest population sizes and the concomitant degree of leaf damage.Conclusions: Damaged host plants have reduced attractiveness to many insect pests, and crops expressing Bt toxins are generally less damaged than conventional counterparts. Resistance management strategies should take account of this behavior, as it has the potential to undermine the effectiveness of existing practice, especially in the tropics where many pests are polyvoltinous. Efforts to bring down total pest population sizes and/or increase the attractiveness of damaged conventional plants will have substantial benefits for slowing the evolution of resistance. © 2014 Téllez-Rodríguez et al."
s_222,3. Reducing Cybersickness: Visual-Vestibular Sensory Conflict: Addressing the mismatch between visual and vestibular signals can reduce symptoms like nausea and headache. Understanding and mitigating these conflicts can enhance overall visual comfort in VR environments .,"Even though reciprocal inhibitory vestibular interactions following visual stimulation have been understood as sensory-reweighting mechanisms to stabilize motion perception; this hypothesis has not been thoroughly investigated with temporal dynamic measurements. Recently, virtual reality technology has been implemented in different medical domains. However, exposure in virtual reality environments can cause discomfort, including nausea or headache, due to visual-vestibular conflicts. We speculated that self-motion perception could be altered by accelerative visual motion stimulation in the virtual reality situation because of the absence of vestibular signals (visual-vestibular sensory conflict), which could result in the sickness. The current study investigated spatio-temporal profiles for motion perception using immersive virtual reality. We demonstrated alterations in neural dynamics under the sensory mismatch condition (accelerative visual motion stimulation) and in participants with high levels of sickness after driving simulation. Additionally, an event-related potentials study revealed that the high-sickness group presented with higher P3 amplitudes in sensory mismatch conditions, suggesting that it would be a substantial demand of cognitive resources for motion perception on sensory mismatch conditions."

Example: The expert performance approach provides a comprehensive framework for expertise theory and educational practice, and it is believed that incorporating technology in training could further enhance the learning process for expert performers .","Ever since the seminal publication by Ericsson and Smith (1991), the expert performance approach has dominated expertise research and has led to increased insight into the mechanisms causing expert performance. From identifying criterion tasks at which expert performers excel (Stage 1), to unraveling the mediating mechanisms that explain expert performance (Stage 2), to analyzing how learning and practice contribute to these mechanisms and identifying implications for effective coaching and teaching (Stage 3), the expert performance approach provides an all-encompassing framework that informs expertise theory and educational practice."
i_3,"Key Components of the Framework: Explainability and Interpretability: Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are crucial for making RL models interpretable. This can involve developing tools to increase the transparency of learned models and ensuring that the models can provide human-understandable explanations. Furthermore, the integration of ethical considerations into XAI frameworks is likely to enhance public trust in AI systems, although this aspect remains largely unaddressed in current research .","The development of theory, frameworks and tools for Explainable AI (XAI) is a very active area of research these days, and articulating any kind of coherence on a vision and challenges is itself a challenge. At least two sometimes complementary and colliding threads have emerged. The first focuses on the development of pragmatic tools for increasing the transparency of automatically learned prediction models, as for instance by deep or reinforcement learning. The second is aimed at anticipating the negative impact of opaque models with the desire to regulate or control impactful consequences of incorrect predictions, especially in sensitive areas like medicine and law. The formulation of methods to augment the construction of predictive models with domain knowledge can provide support for producing human understandable explanations for predictions. This runs in parallel with AI regulatory concerns, like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which sets standards for the production of explanations from automated or semi-automated decision making. Despite the fact that all this research activity is the growing acknowledgement that the topic of explainability is essential, it is important to recall that it is also among the oldest fields of computer science. In fact, early AI was re-traceable, interpretable, thus understandable by and explainable to humans. The goal of this research is to articulate the big picture ideas and their role in advancing the development of XAI systems, to acknowledge their historical roots, and to emphasise the biggest challenges to moving forward."

Concentration: Effective at ~1% on a dry weight basis.","[3] Context: Infectious diseases are one of the major factors affecting the production of fish worldwide. The pathogens (especially bacteria) affect the immune system of fish and the administration of immunostimulants can increase resistance to infectious diseases by enhancing both specific and nonspecific defense mechanisms. Objective: In the present study, we have conducted an experiment on the pathogen-infected Cyprinus carpio Linn. (Cyprinidae), using Euphorbia hirta Linn. (Euphorbiaceae) plant leaves as immunostimulants. Materials and methods: The aqueous extract of the leaves was prepared and the immunostimulant action was recorded by giving different concentrations of plant extract supplemented diet. Results and discussion: The results obtained from the studies show that the higher concentration of the extract (50 g/kg diet) provided significant immune response (specific and nonspecific) on the fish. The 50 g/kg leaf extract of E. hirta enhanced the phagocytic ratio on 10th and 15th day after the infection. The results of the specific and nonspecific immunostimulation studies are statistically significant. Conclusion: This work will guide the researchers for the discovery of significant aquaculture nutrients to improve the immunostimulant action on fish. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc. [6] The white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, fed immunostimulant-free, 0.2%β-glucan and 0.06% glycyrrhizin diets for 18 days, respectively, were challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus at 6.4 × 10 <sup>4</sup>CFUshrimp <sup>-1</sup>. The total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory burst (RB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity changes for a 120-h period were investigated, and shrimp mortality was also recorded. The results showed that PO activity, RB and SOD activity were significantly higher in shrimp fed the two immunostimulant diets after 18 days than those in shrimp fed immunostimulant-free diets. The THC and SOD activity decreased significantly from 0 to 24h post challenge, and then reverted to normal levels at 96 and 72h respectively. The values for PO activity and RB increased from 0 to 48h post challenge. Compared with those fed the control diets, shrimp fed immunostimulants had significantly higher PO activity and RB values at 120h post challenge. Mortalities after challenge with V. alginolyticus were significantly lower in shrimp fed with β-glucan or glycyrrhizin than in those fed with a diet without immunostimulants. It was concluded that dietary β-glucan and glycyrrhizin increased the shrimp immunity. Furthermore, β-glucan caused an increase in some immune parameters 12h earlier than glycyrrhizin after V. alginolyticus challenge. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. [10] In our previous work, two monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) against granulocytes of shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) had been produced, in this paper, haemocyte subpopulations were analyzed by flow cytometry (FCM) using the Mabs. Then immunomagnetic bead (IMB) method was applied for separation hyalinocytes and granulocytes using the Mabs. The separated hyalinocytes and granulocytes were analyzed by FCM, indirect immunofluorescence assay, Giemsa staining and transmission electron microscopy, respectively. The results showed the proportion of hyalinocytes in haemolymph of F. chinensis was 15.14 ± 1.22%, and that of granulocytes was 75.43 ± 2.31%. After two times separation by IMB, the purity rate of hyalinocytes and granulocytes was 96.27 ± 1.06% and 98.13 ± 0.86%, respectively. The hyalinocytes possessed 0.60–0.85 in nucleus/cytoplasm (N/C) ratio and had few granule in cytoplasm, whereas the separated granulocytes with N/C ratio of 0.12–0.36 and high electronic density of double membrane granules. The results reported the separation of haemocyte subpopulations using Mabs in shrimp for the first time, and the hyalinocytes and granulocytes isolated by IMB could be used for their differential protein analysis."
s_989,"Benefits: Antimicrobial Properties: Filters with antimicrobial coatings, such as those containing chitosan, silver, or other antimicrobial agents, can deactivate bacteria and viruses. For instance, PLA/chitosan membranes showed high antibacterial activity against Salmonella and S. aureus .","Particulate matter (PM) pollution, which usually carries viruses and bacteria, has drawn considerable attention as a major threat to public health. In this present study, an environment-friendly antibacterial Poly(lactic acid)(PLA)/chitosan composite air filter was fabricated using the one-step electrospinning technique. The composite PLA/chitosan fibres show a highly porous structure, in which chitosan nanoparticles (NPs) were found to be uniformly distributed throughout the entire fibre. The morphologies, through-pore size and distribution, air filtration and anti-microbial properties of these filter media were studied. The results showed that it was not the chitosan content but instead the concentration of the spinning solutions that had the greatest effect on the morphologies of the porous fibres. The relative humidity influenced the nanometre-scale pores on the surface of PLA/chitosan fibres. The PLA/chitosan fibrous membranes with a chitosan to PLA mass ratio of 2.5:8 exhibited a high filtration efficiency of 98.99% and a relatively low pressure drop (147.60 Pa) when the air flow rate was 14 cm/s, while these also had high antibacterial activity of 99.4% and 99.5% against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, respectively. It took 33 min for the PM<inf>2.5</inf> concentration to decrease to 0 μg/m<sup>3</sup> from 999 μg/m<sup>3</sup> using the PLA/chitosan fibrous membranes, which demonstrates obviously effective air purification performance."
i_1766,"The GWP of a gas is calculated over a specific time horizon, typically 20, 100, or 300 years. The choice of time horizon affects the GWP value, as different gases have different atmospheric lifetimes .","Purpose: The common practice of summing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and applying global warming potentials (GWPs) to calculate CO<inf>2</inf> equivalents misrepresents the global warming effects of emissions that occur over a product or system's life cycle at a particular time in the future. The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.
[2]: Energy technologies emitting differing proportions of methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) and carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) vary significantly in their relative climate impacts over time, due to the distinct atmospheric lifetimes and radiative efficiencies of the two gases. Standard technology comparisons using the global warming potential (GWP) with a fixed time horizon do not account for the timing of emissions in relation to climate policy goals. Here we develop a portfolio optimization model that incorporates changes in technology impacts based on the temporal proximity of emissions to a radiative forcing (RF) stabilization target. An optimal portfolio, maximizing allowed energy consumption while meeting the RF target, is obtained by year-wise minimization of the marginal RF impact in an intended stabilization year. The optimal portfolio calls for using certain higher-CH<inf>4</inf>-emitting technologies prior to an optimal switching year, followed by CH<inf>4</inf>-light technologies as the stabilization year approaches. We apply the model to evaluate transportation technology pairs and find that accounting for dynamic emissions impacts, in place of using the static GWP, can result in CH<inf>4</inf> mitigation timelines and technology transitions that allow for significantly greater energy consumption while meeting a climate policy target. The results can inform the forward-looking evaluation of energy technologies by engineers, private investors, and policy makers."

We document the processes and behaviour that led to significant negative change over time and report on recent work to restore the lake and its surrounding ecosystem. The reported community-initiated actions reflect changing human values and add to the accumulating evidence that the increasing trend of restoring greenspace to native ecosystems (nature space) brings about social and conservation benefits within the urban fabric. Moreover, this narrative also indicates that significant progress can be made in recovering and expanding ecological components and natural values within a relatively short period. Implications for city planners and land managers are self-evident with regard to what can be achieved and the values that communities now place on naturally functioning urban wetlands. Furthermore, the presence of wetlands such as Lake Claremont in the urban fabric is seen to enhance the liveability of the surrounding city by offering a convenient way for residents and tourists to connect with nature and the outdoors and realise the health benefits that the lake can provide. This case study adds to the body of work that identifies and describes the growing importance of urban wetlands in urban landscapes and provides a clear example of what can be achieved at the local community level and with local government support."

A variety of options are currently being investigated to achieve the food security of alternative-to-meat dietary proteins. The food security of alternative to meat proteins will require attention to the availability, the access, the supply stability and the food safety and quality. The aim of this research is to get insight on consumers' food attitudes in order to achieve food security of four alternatives to meat proteins, namely, plant-based proteins, mycoproteins, cultured meat proteins and insect proteins in different development contexts in Spain and the Dominican Republic. In doing so, the research analyses meat consumption, reduces consumers' attitudes using a principal component analysis, predicts first adopters of alternative dietary proteins using a Chi-square test and ranks preferred alternative dietary proteins using a multicriteria decision-making method. The results show that plant-based proteins are the best positioned alternative, while insects are the worst positioned in the Dominican Republic. Gender and education in the Dominican Republic and gender, education and age in Spain are significant factors for the adoption of alternative to meat proteins. Health and convenience attitudes may determine the adoption of alternative dietary proteins in Spain and the Dominican Republic. This research contributes to identifying the consumers' attitudes to encourage the dietary shift to alternative to meat proteins. It can help industry to market alternative-to-meat proteins in different development contexts to achieve food security."

As a result, traditional coffee growing regions may disappear and new regions may appear. At the same time, demand for high quality, responsibly sourced coffee continues to grow globally. For sustainable sources of coffee, participants in the global coffee supply chain need to know where coffee will grow in the future and how the suitability of these areas will change over time. With this information, the supply chain then needs to develop appropriate site-specific mitigation and adaptation strategies for both the short and the long term, to guarantee coffee supply as well as to support improved livelihoods for rural communities. In this paper, we firstly quantify the impact of climate change on the suitability of land to grow coffee in a case study in Nicaragua and on acidity content of beverage coffee in a case study in the Veracruz Department of Mexico. Secondly, we propose site-specific adaptation strategies and finally identify critical potential impacts of climate change on the overall supply chain and the implications for all actors in the system. We conclude the paper by identifying key directions for future research to seek mitigation and adaptation strategies at both the community and the supply-chain level."

It is, however, a preventable disease, with calcium and vitamin D supplementation both playing a part. The development of vitamin D analogues has led to improved treatment and prevention of osteoporosis, with benefits in terms of skeletal muscle function and balance, increased bone volume and inhibition of bone resorption. ED-71 is a second-generation vitamin D analogue with improved binding to vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) compared with calcitriol, the most potent metabolite of natural vitamin D. The preventive and therapeutic effects of ED-71 on bone mineral loss have been demonstrated in rat models of osteoporosis, where it significantly increased bone mineral density without inducing hypercalcemia. Bone histomorphometric studies showed that this effect resulted from stimulation of bone formation together with a reduction in bone resorption. Open, randomized, controlled studies conducted in subjects with osteoporosis have demonstrated a significant positive effect for ED-71 on bone mineral density following 6 and 12 months of treatment.

The aim of this paper is to review social implications of wind energy, with special emphasis on a disadvantaged region in Mexico, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with some of the world's highest wind energy potential, but one of the poorest areas in the country and with a large indigenous population. Wind energy development in Mexico has been complex and contentious; the large increase of wind energy in Oaxaca has created social conflicts in Oaxaca, which even might stop further wind project development in the region. Ultimately, local communities need to be considered in the planning and development process of wind power worldwide and the Mexican case shows the need for a national and regional policy, and a comprehensible on-site participatory planning."

i_266,"Skip Connections: Feature maps from the encoder are concatenated with the corresponding decoder layers via skip connections, ensuring that fine details are preserved. Additionally, the use of skip connections may lead to improved interpretability of the segmentation results, which is a critical factor in clinical applications .","Medical imaging has been a proactive tool for doctors to diagnose and treat diseases via the qualitative and quantitative analyses based on non-invasive lesions. Medical images have been interpreted via computer tomography (CT), X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The barriers of medical image segmentation need to be resolved due to low contrast amongst the lesion, the surrounding tissue and blurred edges of the lesion. Labeling manually for hundreds of slices of organs or lesions has been quite time-consuming due to anatomy of the human body and shape of lesions. Manual labeling has intended to high subjective and low reproducibility. Doctors have been beneficial from a automatically locating, segmenting and quantifying lesions. Deep learning has been used widely in medical image processing. Deep learning-based U-Net has played a key role in the lesions segmentation. The encoding and decoding ways has made U-Net structures simply and symmetrically. Features extraction of medical images has been realized via convolution and down-sampling operations. The image segmentation mask via the transposed convolution and concatenation has been interpreted. A small-sized dataset has achieved qualified medical image segmentation. U-Net has been summarized and analyzed on the four aspects: the definition of U-Net, the upgrading of U-Net model, the setup of U-Net structure and the mechanism of U-Net. Four research areas have been proposed as below: 1) the basic structure and working principle of U-Net via convolution operation, down sampling, up sampling and concatenation. 2) U-Net network model have been demonstrated in three aspects in the context of the number of encoders, multiple U-Net cascades and other models combined with U-Net. U-Net based network have been divided into two, three and four encoders further in terms of the amount of encoders: Y-Net, Ψ-Net and multi-path dense U-Net. Multiple U-Nets cascade has been categorized into multiple U-Nets in series and multiple U-Nets in parallel based on the cascades mode of multiple U-Nets. In addition U-Net has improved the segmentation performance on the aspects of dual tree complex wavelet transform, local difference method, level set, random walk, graph cutting, CNNs(convolutional neural networks) and deep reinforcement learning. The upgrading of U-Net network structure have been divided into six subcategories including image augmentation, convolution operation, down-sampling operation, up-sampling operation, model optimization strategies and concatenation. Image enhancement has be divided into elastic deformation, geometric transformation, generative adversarial networks (GAN), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and real-time image enhancement further. The convolution operation has been improved via padding mode and convolution redesign. The padding mode mentioned has adapted constant padding, zero padding, replication padding and reflection padding and improvements to dilated convolution, inception module and asymmetric convolution. The down-sampling has been improved via max-pooling, average-pooling, stride convolution, dilated convolution, inception module and spatial pyramid pooling. Several up-sampling improvements have illustrated simultaneously via sub-pixel convolution, transposed convolution, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation. Model optimization strategies have been divided into two aspects in detail of activation function and normalization, the improvements of activation function includes rectified linear unit(ReLU), parametric ReLU(PReLU), random ReLU(RReLU), leaky ReLU(LReLU), hard exponential linear sigmoid squahing(HardELiSH) and exponential linear sigmoid squashing(ELiSH), and normalization method. The improvements have been to shown based on batch normalization, group normalization, instance normalization and layer normalization. The concatenation based improvement has been one of the future research area. The current concatenation improvements have been mainly realized via attention mechanism, new concatenation, feature reuse and de-convolution with activation function, annotation information fusion from Siamese network. The improved mechanisms in the U-Net network have been emphasized based on residual mechanism, dense mechanism, attention mechanism and the multi-mechanisms integration. The segmentation performance of the network can be enhanced. The further four research areas in U-Net have been illustrated as below: 1) the generalization of deep learning methods cannot be customized to fit the segmentation network for specific scenarios in the future. 2) Supervised deep learning models have required a lot of annotated images labeled for treatment. Unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models have been a vital research work further. 3) The low interpretability of U-Net network has lead the low acceptance in the mechanism of its operation.4) More accurate segmentation mask with fewer parameters has been obtained via good quality network structure. The precise manual segmentation has been so time-consuming and labor intensive. The simplified and quick semi-automatic segmentation has relied on the parameters and user-specified image preprocessing. The deep learning-based U-Net network has been segmented the lesions quickly, accurately and consistently. The structure, improvements and further research areas of U-Net network have been analyzed to the development of U-Net network.
[2]: The glottis's morphology not only reflects vocal and respiratory information, but also plays an important role in the diagnosis of laryngeal diseases. The glottis segmentation is a primary step in computer-aided diagnostic system, however is challenging due to various shapes of glottis, low contrast with surrounding tissues, the existence of laryngeal diseases and so on. In this paper, a deep attention network based on U-Net with color normalization operation (CN-DA-Unet) is proposed to achieve an end-to-end segmentation of the glottal area for the first time. The original images are first processed by color normalization to reduce the adverse effects of low contrast and large differences in colors between different images. The normalized images are then sent to the proposed DA-Unet for feature extraction. In this network, residual structure is incorporated to extract rich features from deep neural networks. After extracting features, a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module is applied to enhance the semantic information of the glottal area. These features are up-sampled and added to the features from the corresponding encoding layer for several times to obtain the final segmented image. The proposed approach is tested on laryngeal images of an in–house dataset including images from healthy subjects and pathologic subjects.

These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the better performance comparing with several popular networks."
s_1100,"General Ultrasound Image Segmentation: Advanced Techniques: Various advanced techniques have been proposed to improve ultrasound image segmentation, such as: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Morphological Processing: This method is insensitive to speckle noise and can correctly identify tissues in ultrasound images .","Segmentation is a most important but difficult step in ultrasound image analysis. For the speckle noise and the tissue intensity inhomogeneities in the medical ultrasound images, the conventional segmentation approaches based on intensity or intensity-statistics do not work well. Current studies to reduce the speckle noise are failed in boundary preserving. And the researches on intensity inhomogeneites can not obtain the complete structure. In this paper, a new segmental method combined Markov random field (MRF) model with morphological image processing is proposed to cover the shortages above. MRF step is used to estimate the label image and morphological image processing makes the region-of-interest (ROI) complete to get a complete tissue. This algorithm is insensitive to speckle noise. Experimental results on synthetic images and ultrasound images show that this algorithm works successfully in MRF model and can correctly identify the tissues in the medical ultrasound images. © 2007 IEEE."

s_1082,"Key Points: Role of Atrogin-1 in Muscle Atrophy: Atrogin-1 is a muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, which is critical for protein degradation in muscle tissues .","Muscle growth is determined primarily by the balance between protein synthesis and degradation. When rates of protein synthesis are similar between individuals, protein degradation is critical in explaining differences in growth efficiency. Studies in mammals showed that muscle atrophy results from increased protein breakdown, and is associated with activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, including induction of the muscle-specific ubiquitin protein ligase, MuRF1. Animals lacking MuRF1 are resistant to muscle atrophy. In fish, little is known about the role of the proteasome/MuRF pathway in muscle degradation. The objectives of this study were to: 1) clone and characterize MuRF genes in rainbow trout; and 2) determine expression of . MuRF genes in association with starvation- and vitellogenesis-induced muscle atrophy in rainbow trout. We have identified full-length cDNA sequences for three . MuRF genes (MuRF1, MuRF2, and MuRF3). These genes encode proteins with typical MuRF structural domains, including a RING-finger, a B-box and a Leucine-rich coiled-coil domain. RT-PCR analysis showed that MuRF genes are predominantly expressed in muscle and heart tissues. Real time PCR analysis revealed that expression of all . MuRF genes is up-regulated during starvation and . MuRF3 is up-regulated in vitellogenesis-associated muscle degradation. These results suggest that MuRF genes have an important role in fish muscle protein degradation. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential use of MuRF genes as tools to monitor fish muscle growth and degradation. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.
[2]: Skeletal muscle atrophy occurs as a side effect of treatment with synthetic glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (DEX) and is a hallmark of cachectic syndromes associated with increased cortisol levels. The E3 ubiquitin ligase MuRF1 (muscle RING finger protein 1) is transcriptionally upregulated by DEX treatment. Differentiated myotubes treated with DEX undergo depletion of myosin heavy chain protein (MYH), which physically associates with MuRF1. This loss of MYH can be blocked by inhibition of MuRF1 expression. When wild-type and MuRF1<sup>-/-</sup> mice are treated with DEX, the MuRF1<sup>-/-</sup> animals exhibit a relative sparing of MYH. In vitro, MuRF1 is shown to function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for MYH. These data identify the mechanism by which MYH is depleted under atrophy conditions and demonstrate that inhibition of a single E3 ligase, MuRF1, is sufficient to maintain this important sarcomeric protein. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

So far, few studies have been made on the impact of fertilizer input on tea quality. To address the issue, tea was grown under conventional and organic practices to compare the production of biochemical compounds like crude fiber, starch, total phenolics, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate [(-)-EGCG], (-)-gallocatechin gallate [(-)-GCG], and (-)-epicatechin gallate [(-)-ECG], as well as the antioxidant and antidiarrhoeal properties of the tea leaves. Organically grown tea lowered the content of crude fiber and starch as compared to the no-fertilizer treatment (control). However, the content was further lowered by the inorganic fertilizer treatment. Organic fertilization produced higher polyphenol than inorganic fertilization, which has shown greater antioxidant properties when analyzed through the methods of dot-blot and DPPH staining, DPPH radical assay, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. Animal experiments conducted using green tea extracts on rodents revealed better diarrhoea control with organically tea than with inorganically grown tea.

i_1263,"Key Insights: Rapid Adoption and Expansion: The pandemic necessitated a swift transition to telemedicine to maintain healthcare delivery while minimizing virus transmission. This led to the rapid expansion of telemedicine services across different specialties, including primary care, HIV care, fertility practices, and pediatric surgery, despite evidence suggesting that many patients experienced worsened outcomes during this transition .","During the COVID-19 crisis, telemedicine was at the center of the health management systems in the canton of Geneva. Telemedicine contributed to the triage and follow-up of patients with a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, as well as to the coordination of different healthcare actors in the patient's trajectory. New partnerships and reinforcement of coordination in the Geneva healthcare and social care networks with an unprecedented use of telemedicine tools were able to ensure patient care while preserving frontline healthcare providers. Telemedicine has benefited during this time from a temporary relaxation of measures and regulations governing its practice, encouraging its deployment in a crisis situation. However, for these tools to be effective, they need to become an integral part of our healthcare systems.
[2]: Purpose of Review: This review summarizes HIV care delivered via telemedicine before and during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlights areas of study to inform optimal usage of telemedicine in HIV clinical practice in the future. Recent Findings: To address barriers to care created by the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory agencies and payors waived longstanding restrictions, which enabled rapid expansion of telemedicine across the country. Preliminary data show that providers and persons with HIV (PWH) view telemedicine favorably. Some data suggest telemedicine has facilitated retention in care, but other studies have found increasing numbers of PWH lost to follow-up and worsened virologic suppression rates despite offering video and/or telephone visits. Summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated gaps in the HIV care continuum. To help mitigate the impact, most clinics have adopted new virtual care options and are now evaluating usage, impact, and concerns. Further research into the effects of telemedicine on HIV care and continued work towards universal access are needed.
[3]: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in paradigm shifts in the delivery of health care. Lockdowns, quarantines, and local mandates forced many physician practices around the United States to move to remote patient visits and adoption of telemedicine. This has several long-term implications in the future practice of medicine. In this review we outline different models of integrating telemedicine into both male and female fertility practices and recommendations on performing video physical examinations. Moving forward we foresee two general models of integration: one conservative, where initial intake and follow-up is performed remotely, and a second model where most visits are performed via video and patients are only seen preoperatively if necessary. We also discuss the impact THAT telemedicine has on coding and billing and our experience with patient satisfaction.
[4]: Background Within the last decade, the use of telemedicine within in primary care in the USA has greatly expanded; however, use remains uncommon in surgical specialties. The spread of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prompted healthcare institutions to limit in-person contact, resulting in an increase in telemedicine across all specialties, including pediatric surgery. The aims of this review were to evaluate potential barriers that limited the use of telemedicine in pediatric surgery prior to the COVID-19 period and to define how best to incorporate its use into a pediatric surgical practice going forward. Methods A scoping review was performed to identify gaps in the literature pertaining to the use of telemedicine within general pediatric surgery in the USA prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. Next, a focused evaluation of the legislative and organizational policies on telemedicine was performed. Lastly, findings were summarized and recommendations for future research developed in the context of understanding and overcoming barriers that have plagued widespread adoption in the past. Results Despite evidence of telemedicine being safe and well received by adult surgical patients, a total of only three studies representing original research on the use of telemedicine within pediatric surgery were identified. Legislative and organizational policies regarding telemedicine have been altered in response to COVID-19, likely resulting in an increase in the use of telemedicine among pediatric surgeons. Conclusions Telemedicine offers a safe and effective option for patients seeking an alternative to the in-person clinic appointment. The increased utilization of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic will provide an opportunity to learn how best to leverage the technology to decrease disparities and to overcome previous barriers."
i_343,"Parallel Processing: Implement parallel sorting techniques to improve performance, similar to the ""psort"" method for faster sorting .","The main contribution of this paper is to present an efficient parallel sorting ""psort"" compatible with the standard qsort. Our parallel sorting ""psort"" is implemented such that its interface is compatible with ""qsort"" in C Standard Library. Therefore, any application program that uses standard ""qsort"" can be accelerated by simply replacing ""qsort"" call by our ""psort"". Also, ""psort"" uses standard ""qsort"" as a subroutine for local sequential sorting. So, if the performance of ""qsort"" is improved by anyone in the community, then that of our ""psort"" is also automatically improved. To evaluate the performance of our ""psort"", we have implemented our parallel sorting in a Linux server with two Intel quad-core processors (i.e. eight processor cores). The experimental results show that our ""psort"" is approximately 6 times faster than standard ""qsort"" using 8 processors. Since the speed up factor cannot be more than 8 if we use 8 cores, our algorithm is close to optimal. Also, as far as we know, no previously published parallel implementations achieve a speed up factor less than 4 using 8 cores. © 2009 IEEE."

i_872,"Advanced Techniques: Laser-Assisted Drilling (LAD): This technique reduces drilling forces and temperatures, leading to less burr formation. The precision cutting action in LAD helps in easier chip removal and lower thermal damage .","1Defects associated with drilling of fiber reinforced polymers (FRPs) are of major economic and safety concerns for aerospace manufacturers. Delamination of layers and thermal damage of the matrix are the most critical defects associated with drilling of FRP laminates, which can be avoided by keeping the drilling forces and temperatures below some threshold levels. Vibration-assisted drilling (VAD) is an emerging drilling process that uses intermittent cutting to reduce the drilling forces and temperatures, and achieve easier chip removal compared to conventional drilling. In this paper an extensive experimental study has been conducted to provide insight into the effect of the tool kinematics corresponding to the VAD parameters (speed, feed, frequency and amplitude) on the geometry of the formed chip determined by the intersection of the trajectories of the cutting edges as well as on the drilling forces and temperature. The combinations of the VAD parameters used in this study were selected from ranges of speeds 6,000 rpm to 12,000 rpm, feeds 0.05 mm/rev to 0.15 mm/rev, frequencies 30 Hz and 60 Hz, and amplitudes 40 μm to 400 μm. The Amplitude and feed were found to have the most dominant effect on the VAD forces, while the feed and speed had the dominant effect on the VAD temperatures. The thermal performance of the VAD process was found to be enhanced by the formation of vortices in the air gap created by the separation between the tool and the machined surface, which is mainly controlled by the feed and the rotational speed of the tool."
s_760,"Obstacles in Shifting to Digital Methods: Dependence on Technology: Over-reliance on digital tools can lead to a detachment from the physical aspects of design, potentially impacting the tactile and intuitive elements of architectural creation .","Traditionally, architecture in its design process employs physical matter, requires physical presence and relies on real world environment using conventional methods of 2D depictions such as paper and pen or 3D representations such as physical models and communicates design ideas in verbal or text-based form. The conventional design process, for example an interior design, a residential house, a commercial complex or even urban design projects, follows the same hierarchy of activities. Efforts are made to the satisfaction of both parties to give the ideas of a physical shape through sketches, drafts and models which may take weeks, even months. Finally the project gets its final shape in a working drawing, 3D visualisation or model making. This process is time consuming and somewhat redundant. In recent years technology has offered architects a new tool - the virtual environment. Architects use virtual environment increasingly as device of communication and presentation of design intensions. Virtual environment enables users to interact in real-time with design but unfortunately has not been used widely in the process of architectural design. The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between present design process and the emerging technology of virtual reality, establish a relationship between the two and its influence on architecture to form a new translated design process and communication, an interface between architect and client.
[8]: The paper describes the mergence of traditional architectural design processes with approaches that rely on digital media and software for the creation of architectural space. The depicted projects are part of a 'work in progress' process, with a recent studio that is set up to apply the so far accumulated experiences. Within the projects, focus is on those design phases where the applied media and methodology is changed and where the back and forth between different media and the depth of their implementation is perceptible in, and / or has a significant influence on the design itself. Through a line of successive experiments, the paper explains the development of a possible method that utilizes a variety of today's accessible tools in architecture, making use of phenomena that appear when changing from one tool to another. Goal is to avoid limitations that are existent by the solely employment of one media or method, and to understand the fusion between different media as an inspiring momentum to develop the design further. The paper draws a line from an initially experienced and analyzed design method over several projects in practice and academia to conclude with a possible design method that could be established successfully in both fields of architectural teaching and practice. Initial experiences had been drawn from professional practice, in which the digital realm was limited to a support device of the design process. The first project that is described in the paper, explored the employment of digital media as a possible tool to drive the design process in a broader sense. The studio setting was organized as a laboratory for the exploration of the change of applied media. Focus was on the influence on the design progress. The design method required of the studios participants was not exclusively based on an architectural program, but on an initial, very conceptual process with an artistic approach, based on personal experiences of each participant. This was meant to detach the students entirely from architectural processes and mindsets they had picked up so far. Parallel to that kind of an intellectual process, studio participants learned to handle Maya as the 3D modeling software of their choice. Both the technical knowledge and the artistic projects were merged in a second project phase, in which participants had to further develop their work by applying a very effective mix of various design tools. Using digital media as a parametric design generator, subsequent projects were developed. The task for the designers here were to decide what kind of algorithm could be applied to which process and when it was to be stopped for the best result. Applying such an automatism successfully to the design process, the employment of traditional media and methodology remained, to adapt the digital driven schemes to the required design task. The diverse design experiments demonstrate important aspects when merging complex design and animation software with traditional design processes. To achieve good architectural design results, all examined projects showed that traditional design methods with its physical models are hardly replaceable to its full extent by other media, but digital media are able to strengthen design processes and invite designers to explore new means of design work."

For example, mobile technologies like EcoTEXT support environmental grassroots organizations by providing geographically targeted information, thereby fostering community engagement .","[3] Information and communication technology has been ascribed a crucial role in raising resource and energy efficiency and thereby contributing to environmental abatement. This study investigates the effect of information and communication technology on bioenergy industry sustainability in twenty-seven European Union members from 1990 through 2019. Using the panel fully modified ordinary least squares, the outcomes demonstrate that bioenergy industry growth inclines with an increase in information and communication technology input. While the bioenergy industry is found to be decreasing carbon dioxide releases. Economic growth, institutional quality, and human capital are seen to improve the bioenergy industry growth. On the other hand, bioenergy industry development is found to be mitigating carbon dioxide and pollution. The result indicates that bioenergy industry sustainability in EU region members can be well inclined by improving the information and communication technology development in production procedures. This will later help in tackling environmental pollution and climate change. The assessed outcome is viewed to be valid as they were confirmed by panel dynamic ordinary least squares and pooled ordinary least squares. The investigation proposes for European state participants to increase the part of information and communication technology input in their bioenergy industry to increase the growth and sustainability levels. Policymakers in the EU region countries should also invest more in information and communication technology of the bioenergy industry to improve its production and availability. The government of the EU region can similarly focus on technical efficacy, productivity, and sustainability of information and communication technology to achieve bioenergy growth, security, and sustainable development."
s_2212,"Negative Environmental Effects: Underwater Noise Pollution: The construction, particularly pile driving, generates significant underwater noise, which is likely to affect all marine life, including fish and crustaceans, although evidence for this is still limited .","Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

s_101,"Integration of Public Involvement and AI: Enhanced Efficiency: Combining Approaches: The integration of public involvement through bottom-up approaches and the application of AI techniques can lead to more efficient and effective land consolidation processes. Public involvement ensures that local needs and conditions are considered, while AI provides data-driven insights and optimizations .","With socio-economic growth, arable land fragmentation has increasingly become a serious obstacle to agricultural development, in terms of waste of scarce land resource, need of intensive labor input, obstruction of application of machineries, increasing production cost and reducing land use efficiency. Land consolidation has widely been taken as a necessary approach for solving this problem. In the context of rural revitalization, it is of great significance to explore novel patterns of land consolidation besides traditional government-dominated pattern. The objective of this paper was to expound on the mechanism and examine the effectiveness of a new land consolidation pattern, namely the farmer-dominated pattern of ""merging small plots to large plot"", emerging in the rural area of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in hope of making contributions to innovations on land consolidation, rural land reform, and rural revitalization. Methods of semi-structured interviews, quantitative models, and case studies were adopted. This new pattern combined a BOTTOM-UP process of land tenure adjustment, land consolidation plan, design and engineering, spontaneously carried out by farmers, with a TOP-DOWN financial support from government, which was conditional on meeting the requirements of high-standard basic farmland construction. Before ""merging small plots to large plot"", land fragmentation affected agricultural output, production cost and land use efficiency by directly or indirectly acting on input factors of land, labor, capital, technology among others in arable land use system. While ""merging small plots to large plot"" could reallocate land parcels and readjust land tenure, enhance the coordination and mutual adaption of various input factors, hence promote the alignment of productive forces and relations of production. In the case study of Nongnong Village, farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern increased the area of arable land through filling earth ditches and merging field ridge, dramatically reduced plot number through merging small plots, significantly improved arable land use efficiency and agricultural productivity through infrastructure construction such as roads and irrigation facilities and agricultural machineries application. Furthermore, this new pattern substantially increased farmers' income through adjustment of cropping structure and transfer of rural labor into non-farm employments. It was concluded that farmer-dominated land consolidation pattern was a typical model of the BOTTOM-UP land consolidation by the farmers combined with the TOP-DOWN supervision and support by government, could effectively solve the problem of arable land fragmentation and promote optimization and coordination among various input factors of arable land use system, and proved itself as an effective approach to bridge the gap between smallholders and modern agriculture characterized of industrialization and mechanization, which could contribute to rural revitalization and be extended to other regions in China as well as other developing countries. Three insights are suggested to extend this innovation pattern. First, central and provincial governments should issue policies to address the legitimacy problem concerning farmers self-organized land merger and consolidation and to provide financial supports for construction of farmland infrastructures. Second, village elites should play an important role as facilitators, coordinators, or brokers in whole process. Third, a special work team on site, comprised of village cadres, village elites, representatives of all clans and interest groups, should be assembled to deal with conflicts of interests and ensure the synergy of multiple interests and objectives.
[2]: Land administration and land consolidation are two pillars of the Austrian land management sharing a long tradition and duties defined by the constitution. Land administration supports measures of land consolidation with cadastre data, land registry data and other geo-technical data. With new products it is continuously contributing to an improved process efficiency of land consolidation authorities. Within the last years the role of land consolidation changed from an instrument to improve farming structures to a multifunctional tool of land management.
[3]: With hundreds of rigs running and thousands of wells producing in unconventional plays, more and more data becomes available every day and it is ever more tempting to apply machine learning techniques for unconventional development, be it to identify geology sweet spot, understand performance drivers and optimize development strategies such as well spacing, completion and production designs etc. However, most of the previous applications of machine learning are limited to either certain types of data or small areas of interest. Consequently, the results often lack the predictability or generalizability necessary to impact important development decisions. We developed a flexible, scalable and integrated machine learning framework to leverage all sources of data for the goal of optimizing unconventional resources development. The framework is built on a big data warehouse and on-demand capability to efficiently visualize and analyze large volumes of heterogeneous data. The most important pillar of the framework is the ability to transform all different types of data with fit-for-purpose methodologies to be closely related to the evaluation and prediction of well performance. This is enabled mechanistically by an interface to scripting languages such as R or Python for interactive data processing, validation and visualization. We also developed several innovative methodologies to overcome some common challenges in characterizing well performance and analyzing well spatial and temporal relationships in terms of well spacing, stacking and infill timing. Ultimately, all the data is regularized to be ready for machine learning. The framework enables a rich set of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. More importantly, the integration of machine learning with geology, reservoir and development data in a visual environment enables very intuitive and interactive testing, validation and interpretation, which provides valuable insight and confidence for development decision making. The framework has been extensively employed in Permian Basin for important technical studies such as evaluation of new formation, optimization of well completion and spacing, and even PUD reserve booking compatible with SPEE recommended reliable technology. Field case studies clearly demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the framework as well as the predictability and insights the machine learning techniques offer."
i_602,Policy Opposition: Implementing restrictive policies and standards that hinder the adoption of prefabricated housing and compromise its environmental performance .,"Various problems of traditional cast-in-place buildings, such as heavy energy consumption, severe environmental pollution, and low labour productivity, have hindered the development of the construction industry. Prefabricated buildings have a direct bearing on national economic development and transformation of people's lifestyle because of their high economic, environmental, social, and safety benefits. The technological research and development level for prefabricated buildings and system policies in China are still in the initial stage, and the environmental performance and influencing factors of prefabricated buildings limit their large-scale implementation. The literature in developed countries regarding the environmental performance and influencing factors of prefabricated buildings was first reviewed in this study. Community A in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province was used as the case study. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) was applied to measure the factors influencing the environmental performance of prefabricated buildings, and policy suggestions were proposed to improve their environmental performance. Results indicate that developed countries tend to construct prefabricated buildings in large areas because of their remarkable economic, environmental, social, and safety benefits. Measurement results of Community A in Zhengzhou City, Henan Province show that the main environmental pollution factor of prefabricated buildings is waste discharge, accounting for 40%, followed by noise pollution, energy consumption, and dust pollution. The environmental performance of prefabricated buildings can be improved by promoting their development, reducing their environmental pollution, establishing a standard prefabricated concrete system, enhancing the environmental standards for buildings, expanding the application scope of prefabricated concrete, encouraging environmental technology innovation of buildings, cultivating prefabricated building bases, and strengthening environmental governance of construction sites. The findings will serve as reference in determining the main factors influencing the environmental performance of prefabricated buildings, establishing an evaluation system for the environmental benefits of prefabricated buildings, promoting their improvement and optimized development, and enriching and perfecting an evaluation research system for their comprehensive benefits."

In the spatial plan-the core of the landscape sustainable development is: The vertical pattern was determined through the ecological suitability analysis by selecting the key ecological factors; the horizontal pattern was determined by taking the Forman's pattern theory 'union of concentration and deconcentration' as the foundation, then the landscape structure of the Zhengzhou Yellow River waterfront was reconstructed. The overall plan of the landscape sustainable development was carried out with special planning for the agricultural landscape, forestry landscape, traveling landscape and biodiversity landscape. By this way the multi-objective and multi-purpose uses of the River waterfront is completely feasible. [6] The difficulty of assembling sites large enough to redevelop at higher density can impede regeneration in city centers and accelerate suburban sprawl onto large sites already in single ownership. One promising new planning strategy to encourage voluntary land assembly is graduated density zoning, which allows higher density on larger sites. This strategy can increase the incentive for owners to cooperate in a land assembly that creates higher land values. Graduated density zoning will not eliminate the incentive to hold out, but it can create a new fear of being left out. Holdouts who are left with sites that cannot be combined with enough contiguous properties to trigger higher density lose a valuable economic opportunity. This article examines the difficulty of assembling land for infill development, and explains graduated density zoning as a way to encourage voluntary land assembly.

Exemptions can be granted, however, by the competent municipality through land planning and individual decisions. The importance attached to leaving the shore zone untouched varies from region to region. There are large geographical differences in terms of biodiversity, cultural heritage, landscape, development, development pressure, migration and depopulation, and commercial activity, as well as public access to the coastal areas and the ocean.

s_1562,"Conclusion: Delphinin is specifically found in the pollen of Iris lutescens, particularly in the purple flower morph, which contains higher concentrations of this anthocyanin compared to the yellow flower morph .","We describe a flower color polymorphism in Iris lutescens, a species widespread in the Northern part of the Mediterranean basin. We studied the biochemical basis of the difference between purple and yellow flowers, and explored the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such difference, in particular visual discrimination by insects, a potential link with scent emitted and the association between color and scent. Anthocyanins were found to be present in much greater concentrations in purple flowers than in yellow ones, but the anthocyanin composition did not differ between color morphs. Likewise, no quantitative difference in anthocyanin content was found between vegetative tissues of the two morphs. Floral anthocyanins were dominated by delphinidin 3-O-(p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside (also called delphanin) and its aliphatic derivatives. Small amounts of delphinidin 3-O-(p-caffeoylrutinoside)- 5-O-glucoside and its aliphatic derivatives were also characterized. Based on a description of bumblebees' (one of the main pollinators of I. lutescens) color perception, purple and yellow flowers of I. lutescens could be visually discriminated as blue and blue-green, respectively, and likely by a wide variety of other insects. The overall chemical composition of the scent produced was not significantly different between morphs, being dominated by terpenoids, mainly myrcene, (E)-β-ocimene and limonene. A slight color-scent correlation was nevertheless detected, consistent with the shared biosynthetic origin of both pigments and volatile compounds. Therefore in this species, the difference in the amounts of pigments responsible for flower color difference seems to be the major difference between the two morphs. Pollinators are probably the main selective agent driving the evolution of flower color polymorphism in I. lutescens, which represents a suitable species for investigating how such polymorphism is maintained. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

[12]: Electronics is under development in this country in an organized and institutional way since the beginning of 30-ties of the previous century. It grew up from electrical engineering of weak currents and its first name used popularly was communications. It was time when television was born and the radio was maturing. Electronics is a branch of research and technology which deals with generation and processing of electrical and electromagnetic signals. A subject of telecommunications is signal transmission for a distance. Electronics and telecommunications (ET) includes or is combined with other branches like: microelectronics, radioelectronics, optoelectronics, photonics, acoustoelectronics, magnetronics, bioelectronics, energoelectronics, material engineering, semiconductor physics, automation and robotics, mechatronics and microsystems, informatics, teleinformatics, software engineering and other. Devices and functional systems of ET such as computers, data warehouses, cell phones, TV sets, Internet, GPS are build of electronic components and circuits. ET is a branch which belongs to hi - tech area, where the products gather a large load of knowledge of value overcoming frequently the price of work and material. ET has recently turned to an active participant of the processes of generation, storing, processing, transportation, distribution and usage of knowledge in the society. ET started to create artificial intelligence, co - creates intellectual property, searches for knowledge in big data sets, aids medicine, extends virtual/augmented reality, builds Internet of persons and things, strengthens security, protects natural environment, facilitates our life, aids our decisions, activates individuals, equalizes chances, provides convenient personal communications and access to data, starts building a penetrating ubiquitous infrastructure, ceases to be only a branch of technology, grows into the social space, touches culture, sociology, psychology and art. Such an important role of ET is combined with the existence in the society of an adequate infrastructure which recreates the full development cycle of high technology embracing: people, institutions, finances and logistics, in this also science, higher education, education, continuous training, dissemination and outreach, professional social environment, legal basis, political support and lobbying, innovation structures, applications, industry and economy. The digest of chosen development tendencies in ET was made here from the academic perspective, in a wider scale and on this background the national one, trying to situate this branch in the society, determine its changing role to build a new technical infrastructure of a society based on knowledge, a role of builder of many practical gadgets facilitating life, a role of a big future integrator of today's single bricks into certain more useful unity. This digest does not have a character of a systematic analysis of ET. It is a kind of an arbitrary utterance of the authors inside their field of competence. The aim of this paper is to take an active part in the discussion of the academic community in this country on the development strategy of ET, choice of priorities for cyclically rebuilding economy, in competitive environments. The review paper was initiated by the Committee of Electronics and Telecommunications of Polish Academy of Sciences and was published in Polish as introductory chapter of a dedicated expertise, printed in a book format.

s_409,"The value of the platform increases as more users join, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of growth and engagement .","The most solid framework to both analyze and regulate digital platforms is the one which has developed over the past century for the conceptualization and the regulation of the traditional network industries such as telecoms, transport and energy. Digital platforms in multi-sided markets can be considered the new network industries, notably due to the relevance of direct, indirect and algorithmic network effects. As a result, platforms display features which are similar to all industries where network effects are key, namely concentration, market power and subsequently political intervention. Regulatory measures that have already been tested in the traditional network industries can be exported to the new network industries, including regulation to promote competition by reducing barriers to entry, regulation to promote interoperability and structural remedies along with public service obligations imposed on platforms. Examples of this approach can be identified in different initiatives around the world, with the European Union in the lead."
i_1966,"Implications: Public Awareness: Understanding global warming is crucial for public awareness and policy-making. Efforts to educate the public about the causes and effects of global warming can help in mobilizing support for mitigation and adaptation strategies. Additionally, it is believed that increased public engagement in climate change discussions can lead to more innovative solutions being proposed by communities .","Introduction: Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when it lasts for an extended period of time. Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around long-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming. Shifting temperatures are climbing and sea levels are rising. And meanwhile, our planet must still supply us and all living things with air, water, food and safe places to live. If we don't act now, climate change will rapidly alter the lands and waters we all depend upon for survival, leaving our children and grandchildren with a very different world. The most important task of all countries in the face of climate change is to make efforts to reduce climate change and spend more time to anticipate and prevent its risks. The efforts and actions can be done in the current situation are including natural resource conservation, development of green spaces, reduction of power consumption of fossil fuels, saving in consumption, recycling and reduction of waste, sewage treatment, use of renewable energy sources and implementation of appropriate educational programs. The remarkable thing is that these actions by the government alone cannot be done and, thus, all persons in any country should play their role. This requires environmental education in the field of climate change for people to deal with these issues correctly. Thus, in last decade in various countries, study has been done in the field of education to climate change. But reviews of these studies, particularly in Iran, shows that adequate studies have not yet been done to educate climate change in the educational system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of the climate change education plan in the formal education system. Materials and methods: Iran formal education system: educational system of Iran is comprised of three sections. These three sections include formal, informal and implicit. In this study, the third grade of the first period of high school is considered as a case study to develop a climate change education plan. Education in the educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard is in four steps; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation. In the Figure (1), the educational process management is represented according to ISO 10015 standard. (Figure Presented) Results and discussion: As mentioned above in this study, climate change education plan for third grade of the first period of high school is developed based on educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard. Education in this system in four steps includes; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation of results. Needs assessment The results show that, the most important educational needs, which are obtained with Fish Bowl technique, as follows are; introduction of basic concepts, current state of climate, climate change causes, effects and impacts, solutions and strategies for prevention, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Table 1). (Table Presented) Educational designing and planning Educational designing and planning was done in the five steps, which the goals are: Development thinking about the climate change, increase in student knowledge in this field, training of appropriate personnel to manage climate change. (Table Presented) In the implementation of education, teacher is operator training and the Ministry of Education is in the form of Education Office and schools can support teachers in monitoring the implementation. In the evaluation step, the teacher in addition to the evaluation of classroom sessions should do a final evaluation. Thus, the evaluation should be a combination of formative and final assessment, which recommended the use of goal oriented Tyler pattern. Conclusion: Accurate knowledge about the effects of climate change is essential as a key factor for conscious action and the formation of a person's determination to deal with the effects of climate change. Studies from around the world have observed an unfortunate chain of students not being given an adequate and accurate education on climate change, of teachers not knowing how or what to teach, and of the public that is misinformed about these issues. The structure proposed in this study to climate change education determined the contents that require students to do need assessments. This is based on educational designing and planning. Therefore, the teachers with use of educational designing and planning and on the job training increase their knowledge in this field and it will teach the students.
[7]: Global warming is a serious threat to human existence. The relatively higher level of global warming in recent times poses higher health risks to humans, both directly and indirectly. The aim of the study was to investigate public knowledge of global warming and its effects on human health. A nationally representative survey of Ghanaian adults (N=1130) was conducted from November 1, 2018 to February 28, 2019. Results show that 84.4% of the respondents understood the meaning of global warming. Respondents' perceived causes of global warming include natural processes, deforestation, act of the gods, burning of fossil fuel, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission from vehicles and industries. The majority of the respondents (83.4%) indicated that global warming has an impact on human health, while 8.5% indicated that it does not. Majority (78.6%) of the respondents are willing to support efforts to reduce the intensity of global warming. Television (19.1%) and social media (18.6%) were the leading preferred methods for receipt of global warming information. These findings provide useful insights for policy directions. The Government of Ghana and other stakeholders in health should develop a communication strategy to increase and sustain publicity and education of the citizenry on global warming."
i_880,-  ** Surface Roughness Reduction** : Electropolishing significantly reduces surface roughness by removing surface irregularities. This is quantified using parameters such as Ra (average roughness) and Rz (maximum height of the profile) .,"Electropolishing is a widely-used electrochemical surface finishing process for metals. The electropolishing of stainless steel has vast commercial application, such as improving corrosion resistance, improving cleanness, and brightening. The surface topography characterization is performed using several techniques with different lateral resolutions and length scales, from atomic force microscopy in the nano-scale (<0.1 μm) to stylus and optical profilometry in the micro- and mesoscales (0.1 μm-1 mm). This paper presents an experimental length scale study of the surface texture of ground stainless steel followed by an electropolishing process in the micro and meso lateral scales. Both stylus and optical profilometers are used, and multiple cut-off lengths of the standard Gaussian filter are adopted. While the commonly used roughness amplitude parameters (Ra, Rq and Rz) fail to characterize electropolished textures, the root mean square slope (RΔq) is found to better describe the electropolished surfaces and to be insensitive to scale.
[3]: Electropolishing is the method of obtaining extremely smooth surfaces. It is also observed that Electropolishing of stainless steel have enhanced localized corrosion resistance as compared to mechanically prepared surfaces. For biomedical applications such as orthopedic implants it is required that near zero defects surface is ensured.This work studies Electropolishing of solution annealed and cold rolled 316L stainless steel and characterizes the surface physically for roughness, topography and electrochemically for localized corrosion. Characterization techniques involve Profilometry, Specular reflection, SEM, AFM, Ellipsometry, XPS, polarization studies in Hank's solution, and Micro- cell Ecorr noise studies to estimate localized corrosion resistance. The results are compared with nitric acid passivated 316L stainless steel surfaces also. This part summarizes and discusses the results of characterization techniques like profilometry, specular reflection, SEM, AFM and ellipsometry. Surfaces with various degrees of roughness (Ra(μ) 0.09 and 0.14) exhibited similar specular reflectance (71-91%) in the visible range of spectrum. In addition, Surface roughness described only in terms of Ra values may not truly describe the extremely large hills or valleys as expressed by the parameters like Rz, and Rmax. AFM studies revealed the existence of equiaxed peculiar 'diamond' shaped feature (cell width roughly 100nm) upon solution annealed and electropolished sample surface whereas cold rolled and electropolished sample surfaces exhibited 'striped' feature. SEM results also substantiate AFM outcomes. Increasing degree of cold work has its own effect over the surface roughness achieved at the end of surface treatments. Electropolishing or nitric acid passivation of 316L stainless steel enhances the thickness of the oxide film two to three times of the original. © University of Manchester and the authors 2006.
[4]: Several surface modification techniques such as ion implantation, surface laser melting, have been employed to improve pitting corrosion resistance of stainless steel. Electropolishing is a technique in which the surface roughness is eliminated through a selective electrochemical dissolution. The effect of electropolishing on pitting corrosion of 304 stainless steel (SS) was investigated employing polarization technique in conjunction with the scanning electron microcopy examination. Electropolishing process was carried out on wire of 2 mm diameter in 70% phosphoric acid solution at room temperature for 30 min. To elucidate the effect of roughness elimination on pitting corrosion, investigation was carried out on as-received specimen with surface finishing of 60 SiC grit and electropolished specimen in 0.5M NaCl solution at room temperature. A significant decrease on passive current density and also shift of pitting potential towards noble value was recorded on electropolished specimen revealing a pronounce effect of this technique on surface modification. Further investigation was carried out by employing slow ramp anodic potentiodynamic polarization on as received and electropolished specimen. Plot of metastable pitting current transient revealed the reduction on the number and magnitude of metastable pitting transients prior to occurrence of stable pitting on electropolished specimen. EDX analysis of the surface area of as received and electropolished specimens showed modification in surface roughness during electropolishing was the main reason of pitting corrosion improvement. Scanning microscopy investigation of polarized specimens beyond the pitting potential revealed that in as-receives specimen pits were nucleated in at and in the vicinity of surface scratches that was created during surface abrading."
s_2225,Environmental and Soil Characteristics: Soil Texture and Organic Matter: Lead concentration is influenced by soil texture and organic matter content. Finer particles and higher organic matter can enhance lead retention in the soil .,"[10] Soil samples were taken near oil refinery activities, bulk and fractionated heavy metal contents, as well as other physico-chemieal characteristics were measured. The reported results indicate that the enrichment factors of the measured heavy metals were 3.9, 1.8, 1.3, 23.7 and 52.5 for lead, nickel, zinc, cadmium and mercury, respectively. The samples can be considered to be extremely contaminated with respect to mercury, strongly contaminated with respect to cadmium, moderately to uncontaminated with respect to lead and nickel, and uncontaminated with respect to zinc. The distribution of the measured heavy metals is affected by pH, clay content, total dissolved solids, cation exchange capacity, organic matter content and carbonate content. Lead, nickel and zinc are mainly associated with the residual fraction and are relatively immobile, and therefore they are unlikely to pose a threat to the ecosystem under natural environmental conditions.

i_615,Control Approaches 1.  - : This approach uses an impedance model to generate desired trajectories based on the interaction torque between the human and the exoskeleton. The torque is measured using a pneumatic actuator with a torsion spring .,"Sit To Stand (STS) movement is an important daily living activity and usually a difficult task to achieve, particularly, by post stroke patients. In this study a hybrid control approach that combines the use of an impedance-based exoskeleton controller and an event-based Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) of the knee extensor muscle to assist the STS transfer movement within an assistance as needed strategy. Actuation of the active lower limb exoskeleton is done using a Serial Elastic Actuator (SEA) that uses a torsion spring to guarantee the measurement of the human exoskeleton interaction torque. The measured torque is fed to a linear desired impedance model to generate a desired trajectory, which will be tracked by the exoskeleton's actuators. Experiments were conducted with one healthy subject to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The obtained performances show the synergy between the assistance provided through FES of the quadriceps muscle during the extension sub-phase of the STS movement and the one delivered by the knee joint actuator of the lower limb exoskeleton."
i_103,"Domain Adaptation Techniques: While the abstracts do not specifically mention ResUNet's domain adaptation methods, general strategies used in similar models include adversarial learning and output space adaptation. These techniques help align the feature distributions between the source and target domains, thereby improving the model's generalization capability .","Supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated state-of-art performance in medical image segmentation tasks. However, the performance of a well-trained CNN on an independent dataset (e.g., different vendors, sequences) relies strongly on the distribution similarity, and may drop unexpectedly in case of distribution shift. To obtain a large amount of annotation from each new dataset for re-training the CNN is expensive and impractical. Adaptation algorithms to improve the CNN generalizability from source domain to target domain has significant practical value. In this work, we propose a highly efficient end-to-end domain adaptation approach, with left ventricle segmentation from cine MRI sequences as an example. We propose to perform domain adaptation in the output space where different domains share the strongest similarities. The core of this algorithm is a flexible and light output adaption module based on adversarial learning. Moreover, Canny edge detector is introduced to enhance model's attention to edges during adversarial learning. Comparative experiments were carried out using images from three major MR vendors (Philips, Siemens, and GE) as three domains. Our results demonstrated that the proposed method substantially improved the generalization of the trained CNN model from one vendor to other vendors without any additional annotation. Moreover, the ablation study proved that introducing Canny edge detector further refined the edge detection in segmentation. The proposed adaption is generic can be extended to other medical image segmentation problems.
[4]: The convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used in various medical image segmentation tasks. However, the training of CNN extremely relies on large amounts of sample images and precisely annotated labels, which is difficult to get in medical field. Domain adaptation can utilize limited labeled images of source domain to improve the performance of target domain. In this paper, we propose a novel domain adaptive predicting-refinement network called DAPR-Net to perform domain adaptive segmentation task on retinal vessel images. In order to mitigate the gap between two domains, the Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) is employed in the preprocessing operations. Since the segmentation result generated by only predicting module can be affected by domain shift, refinement module is used to produce more precise segmentation results and further reduce the harmful impact of domain shift. Atrous convolution is also adopted in both predicting module and refinement module to capture wider and deeper semantic features. Our method has advantages over previous works based on adversarial networks, because in our method smoothing domain shift with preprocessing has little overhead and the data from target domain is not needed when training. Experiments on different retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that the proposed method improves accuracy of segmentation results in dealing with domain shift."
i_141,5.   ** Feature Enhancement and Mixed Distance Maximization** : ** Feature Enhancement** : Techniques like body symmetry and part-locality-guided feature enhancement improve the robustness of deep learning models by leveraging inherent appearance properties  .,"[3] As a basic task of multi-camera surveillance system, person re-identification aims to re-identify a query pedestrian observed from non-overlapping multiple cameras or across different time with a single camera. Recently, deep learning-based person re-identification models have achieved great success in many benchmarks. However, these supervised models require a large amount of labeled image data, and the process of manual labeling spends much manpower and time. In this study, we introduce a method to automatically synthesize labeled person images and adopt them to increase the sample number per identity for person re-identification datasets. To be specific, we use block rectangles to randomly occlude pedestrian images. Then, a generative adversarial network (GAN) model is proposed to use paired occluded and original images to synthesize the de-occluded images that are similar but not identical to the original image. Afterward, we annotate the de-occluded images with the same labels of their corresponding raw images and use them to augment the number of samples per identity. Finally, we use the augmented datasets to train baseline model. The experimental results on CUHK03, Market-1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method. [4] Person re-identification is a critical yet challenging task in video surveillance. It aims to match the same person across cameras. Practically, people's appearances vary greatly across cameras. Most deep learning methods rely on single-level features of deep layer while ignoring low-level detailed features of shallow layers, since different layers have different sizes of feature maps and different layers' features cannot be concatenated without extra downsampling or upsampling. To remedy this problem, we propose a novel yet simple self-attention learning method for person re-identification. We design a convolutional neural network(CNN) to capture multi-level information from different layers while keeping spatial resolution of feature maps unchanged by using dilated convolution. Multi-level information consists of two parts: multi-level attention maps and multi-level feature maps. Multi-level attention maps are constrained and multi-level feature maps are concatenated easily. And we combine softmax loss with quadruplet loss, taking full advantages of labels and metric learning at the same time. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves excellent performance for person re-identification and self-attention constraint can also be used in many other tasks."

One study found that the protein content in shrimp shells (which include the head) varied between 33% and 40% of the dry weight . This indicates a significant protein presence in the waste material.","The chemical composition of shrimp shells from the deep-water shrimp (Pandalus borealis) obtained from a local factory in northern Norway that were harvested from January to December (2000) in the Barents Sea was investigated. The average dry matter content of the samples of shrimp shells was 22 ± 2%, with no significant seasonal variation. The protein content was found to vary between 33% and 40% of the dry weight, the chitin content varied between 17% and 20% and the ash content of dried shrimp shells was found to be relatively constant with an average value of 34 ± 2% of the dry weight and consisting mainly of calcium carbonate (CaCO<inf>3</inf>). No clear seasonal variations were found for the content of these three main components of shrimp shells (protein, chitin and ash). The shrimp shells had a very low lipid content, varying from 0.3% to 0.5% of the dry weight. The content of astaxanthin was found to vary from 14 to 39 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in the samples of wet shrimp shells. In relation to its use as a raw material for chitin production, no clear seasonal variation was found in the intrinsic viscosities/molecular weights of the chitin extracted from the shrimp shells using an optimized extraction procedure for chitin extraction, suggesting that chitin producers can rely on shrimp shell waste as a stable raw material for chitin production independent of season. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, the effects of rTMS combined with motor training on brain neural activities were investigated based on the method of brain network. Ten healthy volunteers were recruited. The 1 Hz rTMS over the dominant hemisphere combined with unfamiliar motor training with non-dominant hand subsequently was performed rTMS combined with motor training lasted 14 days to improve the motor function of non-dominant hand. Electroencephalography (EEG) in resting state with eyes closed was recorded before and after rTMS combined with motor training. The functional connectivity was analyzed using the method of phase lag index (PLI). We constructed weighted network and calculated the network topology characteristics based on PLI, subsequently. Finally, the signedrank test was used for statistical analysis. We found that the changes of functional connectivity could be detected mainly between functional regions rather than inside regions. The functional connectivity at lower frequency band (theta and alpha) was significantly increased, and was opposite at higher frequency band (beta, gamma, and gamma<inf>2</inf>). Furthermore, we found that the rTMS combined with motor training had a significant influence on the functional connectivity between central region in non-dominant hemisphere and dominant frontal regions (before; 0. 141 4 ±0. 102 5;after:0. 217 2 ±0. 134 7; P < 0. 05) and non-dominant frontal regions(before:0. 141 0 ± 0. 109 9; after; 0. 205 9 ± 0. 136 1; P < 0. 05) at alpha frequency. Node efficiency increased at low band and decreased at high band, and node path length was opposite.

s_1785,"Summary: Accelerated on-site aerobic decomposition of high-salt and oily food waste using a designed synthetic microbial community can be achieved by: Selecting Halotolerant Microbes: Incorporating halotolerant bacteria and archaea that can withstand high salt concentrations, similar to those used in saline fish waste bioconversion .","Environmentally responsible disposal of solid organic wastes from land-based brackish and marine recirculating aquaculture systems is critical for promoting widespread acceptance and implementation, but conversion efficiency of saline sludge to biomethane is generally low. We describe the development of a microbial consortium that can convert marine organic fish waste solids to biomethane at over 90% efficiency. The halotolerant microbial consortium, which was developed by sequential transfer in seawater with fish waste, is optimized for low COD:N ratios typical of organic fish waste and does not require addition of amendments such as organic carbon or nutrients. Temperatures for maximum rates of conversion range from 26 to 35. °C. Five predominant phylotypes identified in the microbial consortium by denaturing HPLC were isolated. Two isolates included anaerobic fermentative bacteria identified as a strain of Dethiosulfovibrio and a strain closely related to Fusobacterium spp., which both hydrolyze and ferment proteins, peptides and amino acids. The other three isolates included an acetate-utilizing methanogenic archaeon identified as a strain of Methanosarcina and two hydrogen-utilizing methanogenic archaea identified as strains of Methanogenium and Methanoplanus. Bioconversion rates of sterile fish waste with the reconstituted microbial consortium containing all five isolates were equivalent to rates observed with the original enriched consortium after one sequential transfer. The results demonstrate unequivocally that halotolerant consortia of bacteria and archaea can be developed for bioconversion of saline organic solid waste with high efficiencies equivalent to those attained with non-saline waste systems. Understanding the microbial community composition is critical for management of solid organic waste from land-based marine aquaculture systems and to maintain or restore microbiota during start up and throughout the production process. Statement of relevance: Appropriate disposal of solid organic wastes from land-based brackish and marine recirculating aquaculture systems is critical for promoting widespread acceptance and implementation. We demonstrate that halotolerant consortia of bacteria and archaea can be developed for bioconversion of saline fish waste with high efficiencies equivalent to those attained with non-saline waste systems."
s_2071,"Adaptation Strategies: Relocation and Agroforestry: Relocating coffee farms to higher altitudes or more suitable regions can mitigate some of the adverse effects of climate change. Agroforestry systems, such as intercropping coffee with shade trees like macauba, can help reduce temperature extremes and improve soil moisture, thereby enhancing coffee productivity. Additionally, it is possible that integrating other native species alongside macauba could further optimize the agroforestry system's benefits for coffee production, although this remains to be studied .","Global climate changes can affect coffee production in Brazil, and in other coffee producing countries. We examined the potential for an agroforestry system with the native species, macauba (Acrocomia aculeata), to mitigate impacts on coffee production by reducing maximal air temperature and photosynthetic active radiation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of an agroforestry system with macauba on productivity, microclimatic characteristics and soil physical quality on a coffee plantation in the Atlantic Rainforest biome, in Southern Brazil. We measured soil attributes (moisture, temperature, and physical properties), microclimate conditions (air temperature, photosynthetic active radiation) and coffee production parameters (productivity and yield). Macauba palm trees were planted at different planting densities on the rows and distances from the coffee rows. Planting density of macauba and their distance from the coffee rows affected soil thermal-water regime. Compared with the traditional unshaded sole coffee planting, the intercropped cultivation provided more coffee yield on both macauba density planting and distance evaluated. On the other hand, coffee productivity was increased by agroforestry systems just for 4.2 m distance between palm trees and coffee rows. Planting density of macaubas did not affect coffee yield and productivity. Best coffee harvest in agroforestry systems with macauba was related to higher soil moisture at the depth of 20–40 cm, higher photosynthetic active radiation, and maximum air temperatures lower than 30 °C. Agroforestry with coffee and macauba trees can be an adaptation strategy under future climatic variability and change related to high temperatures and low rainfall."

In looking to the field of ocean and human health, analysis of ocean law, policies, and regulation is essential in acknowledging the critical connection between the well-being of the ocean and the well-being of humanity. This chapter provides an overview of international ocean and marine law, examining vital conventions and agreements that have entered into force across the decades, and explaining their impact on ocean and human health. While not detailing every framework drafted at the international level, the chapter instead highlights a specific few which truly illuminate the interconnectedness between the people and the planet, concluding by looking to the future of ocean and human health governance to identify how the field must advance to preserve the health of all life existing on the planet.
[8]: The ocean regulates the global climate, provides humans with natural resources such as food, materials, important substances, and energy, and is essential for international trade and recreational and cultural activities. Together with human development and economic growth, free access to, and availability of, ocean resources and services have exerted strong pressure on marine systems, ranging from overfishing, increasing resource extraction, and alteration of coastal zones to various types of thoughtless pollution. International cooperation and effective governance are required to protect the marine environment and promote the sustainable use of marine resources in such a way that due account can be taken of the environmental values of current generations and the needs of future generations. The high seas deserve particular attention since they suffer from a number of regulatory shortcomings due to the basic structures set out under international law.

On the other hand, Family Medicine is a discipline that seeks the comprehensive health care of the person and the family, in a humanized and continuous way; it is characterized by the integration of health promotion and prevention of risks and diseases, detection, and treatment, with a systemic approach that focuses its actions to the individual, family and community, and in which the Primary Health Care is its essential field of action. Objective: To reflect on the relevance of the family and community doctor, the elements of Primary Health Care and their relationship in the framework of the new comprehensive health care model in Colombia. Methods: A review of different sources of information in indexed journals and official documents was carried out. Those allowed responding to the objective of the document. Conclusions: The specialty of Family Medicine is the most competent to carry out medical interventions within the framework of the new comprehensive health care model, looking for integral well-being and avoiding the fragmentation of care."
s_1513,"-  ** Mango Peel: ** Optimal conditions included 49% ethanol, 61°C, and 200 minutes, maximizing phenolic content and antioxidant activity .","The aim of this study is to use a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the ethanolic extraction of polyphenol compounds from mango peels. The Nam-Dokmai peel (NDP) showed significantly higher phenolic compounds and tyrosinase inhibitory activity than that of the Tong-Dam peel (TDP) (p < 0.05). A solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:30 was fixed for the RSM. The independent processing variables applied to the RSM were the ethanol concentrations, temperatures, and extraction times. The results show that the second-order polynomial models derived from the responses correlated well with the experimental data (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.80). The ethanol concentrations and temperature variables significantly affected antioxidant activities (p < 0.05). A low ethanol concentration and a high temperature produced an increased yield while high ethanol concentration and high temperature was the most effective for increasing extractable phenolic content (EPC) and antioxidative activities. Therefore, the optimal conditions that maximized the extraction yields, EPC, and the antioxidant activities for NDP were ethanol proportion of 49%, a temperature of 61 °C, and an extraction time of 221 min."
s_1387,"A fertility-sparing option where the cervix is removed but the uterus is preserved is often considered suitable for all patients with early-stage disease (IA2) who wish to maintain fertility, despite the fact that not all cases may benefit from this approach .","Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women. Nowadays approximately half of the cases younger than 45 years old. Treatment of cervical cancer, varies according to stage of disease. In the early stage, radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy or chemoradiotheraphy are recommended for standart treatment that affect fertility adversely in reproductive aged women. New therapeutic options in the treatment of this disease have been developed because of increasing incidence of cervical cancer in young population who have not already completed their fertility. Herein, a therapeutic option of radical abdominal trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy performed in a stage IA<inf>2</inf> cervical cancer patient who desire to preserve her fertility has been discussed together with literature. Copyright © 2011 by Türkiye Klinikleri.
[3]: Standard treatment for invasive cervical cancer involves either radical surgery or radiotherapy. Childbearing is therefore impossible after either of these treatments. A fertility-sparing option, however, by radical trachelectomy has been shown to be effective, provided that strict criteria for selection are followed. Fertility rates are high, whereas recurrence is low, indicating that a more conservative approach to dealing with early small cervical tumours is feasible. Careful preoperative assessment by magnetic resonance imaging scans allows accurate measurement of the tumour with precise definition to plan surgery. This will ensure an adequate clear margin by wide excision of the tumour excising the cervix by radical vaginal trachelectomy with surrounding para-cervical and upper vaginal tissues. An isthmic cerclage is inserted to provide competence at the level of the internal orifice. A primary vagino-isthmic anastomosis is conducted to restore continuity of the lower genital tract. Subsequent pregnancies require careful monitoring in view of the high risk of spontaneous premature rupture of the membranes. Delivery by classical caesarean section is necessary at the onset of labour or electively before term. Over 1100 such procedures have been carried out vaginally or abdominally, resulting in 240 live births. Radical vaginal trachelectomy with a laparoscopic pelvic-node dissection offers the least morbid and invasive route for surgery, provided that adequate surgical skills have been obtained. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[4]: Invasive cervical cancer remains the second commonest female malignancy worldwide. Early-stage disease may be asymptomatic. Advances in imaging techniques have improved selection of the appropriate treatment approach. Treatment options vary for each stage. An excisional cone is sufficient for treatment of micro-invasive disease (Ia1) provided the margins are clear. The management of stage Ia2 disease is more controversial. Surgery and radiation have similar survival rates for stage Ib-IIa disease, while the combination of both increases morbidity. Later stage tumours (IIb-IV) should be treated with chemoradiation as this is related to improved survival but also higher short- and medium-term toxicity in comparison to radiotherapy alone. Fertility-sparing surgical techniques such as radical trachelectomy may be appropriate in selected cases. Management of recurrent disease depends on the initial treatment, the individual characteristics and the presence of distant disease. Management of cervical cancer during pregnancy remains a challenge and appropriate counselling on individual patient basis is necessary. As the disease usually affects young women, psychological morbidity is significant and emotional support is essential. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

Perinatally infected HIV-positive adolescents have a high prevalence of mental health disorders; however, little is known about those retained in care in South Africa. Methods: HIV-positive adolescents aged 13–19 years (n = 343) accessing five paediatric antiretroviral clinics in Johannesburg were assessed using standardized measures for depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicidality. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted on all variables using Statistica v13. Results: Twenty-seven percent were symptomatic for depression, anxiety, or PTSD; 24% reported suicidality. Peer violence was significantly correlated to all mental health problems, as was hunger, being inappropriately touched, being hit, and being female. Those reporting sickness in the past year were more symptomatic. High exposure to violence was evident. Additionally, not feeling safe at home or in the community increased risk for all mental health disorders. Knowing one's HIV status was protective as was having dreams for the future. Conclusion: HIV-positive adolescents accessing care demonstrated high levels of mental health problems that are largely unrecognized and could potentially be addressed within health systems. Mental health difficulties are driven by social challenges that require attention."

This can lead to more effective, safe, and equitable patient care, contributing to the overall sustainability of the health sector .","The Peruvian health sector has a major shortcoming in Latin America because it does not have enough biomedical engineers (BMEs). This situation leads to negative impacts on the quality of a number of outcomes, including: health services, research, management, policies, regulation, etc. Health technology today is engaged in all the key processes: planning, operational, financial, that supports the health organizations. Despite Peruvian health professionals' efforts the lack of an appropriate technological environment and sufficient numbers of BME professionals prevents a good understanding and/or management of the situation, thus affecting the decisions applied to key aspects involved in the sustainability, effectiveness and health disparities in the Peruvian health organizations, both public and private. In addition, the costs due to these inefficiencies jeopardize the governmental investment (public health sector) and the gains of the health enterprises, leading to ineffective, unsafe and inequitable patient care. BME is a discipline devoted to the use of engineering principles and techniques to the study of biological, physiological and medical processes at all length scales. It is a fast growing career in both developed and developing countries, and contributes to the scientific, economic and social development and welfare of society. Its roots are firmly embedded in applying the engineering perspective to health delivery systems and health technology management (clinical engineering). It has been exceptionally successful in applying computational modeling techniques to describe complex biological systems and providing context for experimental approaches to molecular, cellular, tissue and organ system processes. Recently, understanding of biological phenomena has been informing the design of new engineering materials and processes (biomimetic). Most Latin American countries have this specialization at the undergraduate level; model programs exist in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Mexico. Two leading Latin American private Peruvian universities, Pontificia Universidad Católica del Peru (PUCP) and Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) have agreed to create a joint world-class BME undergraduate program using the institutions' strengths. Peruvian BME status is rising quickly. This academic project between PUCP-UPCH to develop the BME curriculum is a valuable and exciting collaboration. We report here the current situation in Peru with respect to the rise of BME."
s_1490,"Occurrence: Global Presence: BLS is prevalent in many banana-growing regions around the world. It has been reported in various countries, including Brazil and Guadeloupe .","Black leaf streak (BLS) is a devastating disease for many traditional banana cultivars. In Brazil, resistant cultivars are being studied but consumers' preference needs to be taken into account for adoption to be successful. In this work, the acceptability of six BLS-resistant hybrids, 'Vitoria', 'Maravilha', 'PA 4244', 'FHIA-18', 'Tropical' (all AAAB group) and 'Bucanero' (AAAA), was assessed in the Brazilian Northeast region and compared to BLS-susceptible commercial cultivars from the AAB group ('Prata Anã' and 'Maçã'). A hedonic scale was applied to external appearance of hands (global appearance, size, color), overall acceptance of fruits and acceptance per attribute (flavor and texture). Also, purchase intent was annotated. Data were submitted to ANOVA and Preference Mapping. 'PA 4244' presented high acceptance, both for external appearance and palatability. Flavor and texture of 'Maravilha', 'Vitoria' and 'FHIA-18' pleased consumers, but their appearance could be still improved. 'Bucanero' has low chances of adoption based on the opinion of consumers from the Brazilian northeastern region.
[2]: Banana streak viruses (BSVs) infect banana worldwide. BSV sequences present in the genome of Musa balbisiana hamper the detection of cognate episomal viruses by PCR, since PCR results in the amplification of both episomal viral DNA and integrated viral sequences, leading to false positives. A simple single-step multiplex immunocapture PCR (M-IC-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of only episomal BSV. This technique was applied in a study of the occurrence of BSV in Guadeloupe. Leaf samples from the main banana genotypes were indexed for the presence of major BSV species. Although no symptoms could be observed, BSV was found to be common in plantain (AAB), probably as a result of the widespread use of contaminated suckers. In contrast, BSV was uncommon on dessert banana cultivars (AAA), showing that the use of virus-free certified in vitro plants is an efficient strategy for controlling the spread of BSV, and that vector-borne transmission of BSV from plantain to dessert banana is very low in Guadeloupe. Our study also showed that Banana streak GF virus is the most prevalent species in Guadeloupe, with species Banana streak OL virus and Banana streak Mysore virus present at much lower levels. Using the same leaf samples, a study on the occurrence and diversity of Banana virus X (BVX), a member of the Flexiviridae family, which has been recently described and characterised in Guadeloupe, was undertaken. Indexing by direct-binding reverse transcription PCR showed that BVX is very uncommon in Guadeloupe and has a low level of molecular diversity. This is in contrast to Banana mild mosaic virus, which is a closely related member of the Flexiviridae family, and for which an immunocapture reverse transcription nested PCR detection method was established.
[3]: This study aimed to evaluate development and production of banana plant 'Grande Naine' under different management systems with black leaf streak presence at Vale do Ribeira, SP (Brazil). For the experiment it was used micropropagated seedlings of 'Grande Naine' banana that was planted in field in a completely randomized design with five treatments (management systems): interspersed planting; fungicide control; defoliation + interspersed planting; defoliation + fungicide control and control, which were subdivided in time (two production cycles), with eight repetition and one plant per repetition. It was evaluated the following parameters: plant height, pseudostem diameter, number of active leaves at blooming and at harvest, marketable fruits fresh weight, productivity, number of hands, number of fruit, total fresh weight and individual fresh weight of the 2<sup>nd</sup> hand, length and diameter of 2<sup>nd</sup> hand fruits. Data were submitted to variance analysis by F test and the significant means were compared by Tukey's test (5% probability). It can be conclude that fungicides applications were effective for black leaf streak control, showing better results in plants development and production and also in fruit quality of cultivars Grande Naine. No differences were observed when fungicide application was associated with defoliation. The interspersed planting affected negatively all the development and production parameters of cultivar Grande Naine."

Remote Sensing and Monitoring: IoT and Sensors: The Internet of Things (IoT) and AI-enabled sensors monitor various agricultural parameters, which may reduce water, fuel, and fertilizer usage, but their impact on increasing yields is still uncertain and varies significantly across different regions .","Agriculture 4.0 refers to systems that employ drones, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), vertical farms, artificial intelligence (AI), and solar energy. Through the integration of digital technology into farming practices, companies are able to increase yields, reduce costs, experience less crop damage, and minimize water, fuel, and fertilizer usage. For the consumer, this equals cheaper and better quality food. However, there are some of the complex challenges the crop production industry, along with diminishing production profit margins for farmers. To grow the food and to provide the world needs, crop production systems need innovative solutions to produce more in an environmentally, economically, and socially viable way. So, while the conceptual framework, intentions, and the scope revolving around Agriculture 4.0 are thought provoking and exciting at the first instance, its successful implementation is the main challenge in many countries all over the world.
[10]: The digitalization of agriculture is much slower than in other industries, due to the high cost of digital solutions and their complex functionality. Recently, the situation is changing, and now agriculture can get real benefits from technology with simple software solutions. Technologies used in agriculture include sensors, mobile devices, communication networks, drones, robotics, artificial intelligence, and others. These technologies provide an opportunity to improve the business processes of agriculture and increase its efficiency. In 2020, the agritech startup ecosystem of Ukraine has more than 70 startups that have been used for farm management, drones and remote sensing, precision farming, and urban agriculture. SWOT analysis indicate that the agritech startup ecosystem is characterized by more weaknesses and threats than strengths and opportunities. The Ukrainian agricultural sector has significant potential for increasing efficiency and development. Agriculture today needs startups that use information technology to address the balance of economic, environmental, and social efficiency to increase agricultural productivity."
s_2210,"Positive Environmental Effects: Positive Effects on Marine Life: Offshore wind farms can create new habitats for marine life, such as commercial fish and shellfish, due to the structures acting as artificial reefs .","Globally, the deployment of offshore wind is expanding rapidly. An improved understanding of the economic, social and environmental impacts of this sector, and how they compare with those of other energy systems, is therefore necessary to support energy policy and planning decisions. The ecosystem services approach provides a more holistic perspective of socio-ecological systems than traditional environmental impact assessment. The approach also makes possible comparisons across disparate ecological communities because it considers the societal implications of ecological impacts rather than remaining focused on specific species or habitats. By reporting outcomes in societal terms, the approach also facilitates communication with decision makers and the evaluation of trade-offs. The impacts of offshore wind development on ecosystem services were assessed through a qualitative process of mapping the ecological and cultural parameters evaluated in 78 empirical studies onto the Common International Classification for Ecosystem Services (CICES) framework. The research demonstrates that a wide range of biophysical variables can be consistently mapped onto the CICES hierarchy, supporting development of the ecosystem service approach from a broad concept into an operational tool for impact assessment. However, to improve confidence in the outcomes, there remains a need for direct measurement of the impacts of offshore wind farms on ecosystem services and for standardised definitions of the assumptions made in linking ecological and cultural change to ecosystem service impacts. The process showed that offshore wind farms have mixed impacts across different ecosystem services, with negative effects on the seascape and the spread of non-native species, and positive effects on commercial fish and shellfish, potentially of most significance. The work also highlighted the need for a better understanding of long term and population level effects of offshore wind farms on species and habitats, and how these are placed in the context of other pressures on the marine environment."
s_2163,"Economic and Social Benefits: Energy Security and Sustainability: Offshore wind energy is the sole contributor to energy security by providing a renewable and sustainable source of electricity, which completely eliminates dependence on fossil fuels and guarantees the achievement of climate protection goals .","Unquestionably, wind energy is the vanguard of the expansion of renewable energies in Germany, and just as unquestionably, the future of wind energy is at sea. According to the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) the utilisation of offshore wind power holds the greatest potential among renewable energy sources in the medium term for achieving Germany's climate protection goals and its goals for the expansion of the share of renewable energies in the country's electric power supply. At the same time, an evasion to the open sea provides the possibility to avoid increasing conflicts in the settlement of land-based wind power facilities. However, the use of offshore wind energy is certainly not without ecological risks which pose particular challenges to the planning and design of wind farms. On the one hand, the prospect of expansion provides promises of the realisation of sustainability and climate-protection goals. Windpower facilities produce clean electric power without the emission of climate- threatening gases. Furthermore, the production of wind energy will contribute to reducing the dependence on fossil fuels and energy imports. On the other hand, however, this form of energy production also carries the potential for negative impacts on the marine environment. In addition to the compliance with the principle of precaution through the gradual expansion of offshore wind energy, the goal of ecological accompanying research is to eliminate existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps and to ensure an energy production process which is environmentally appropriate and compatible with the conservation of nature. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

[4]: Driven by the evidence of climate change many governments have decided to reduce carbon emissionsassociated with the production of electricity. Hence, there has been an increase in the use of renewableenergy. Additional benefits include moving towards an energy supply which is more sustainable and moredistributed. International targets for decarbonisation of the economy have been agreed at COP21 meetingsin Paris in 2015. Of the renewable electricity technologies available, offshore wind allows electricity tobe generated at scale and at a reasonable price (as can be seen from the second round of UK contractfor difference see [1]). However, for many countries bottom fixed turbines are technically or commercialunfeasible due to water depth and seabed geology at suitable sites. This has been the inspiration for muchresearch into floating wind turbines, see for example Musial et al [2]. Offshore Wind (OSW) is rapidly maturing sector and is increasingly seen as a major contributor toelectricity supply in states with coastal demand centres and good wind resource. While there is a 28-yearhistory and set of experiences that has been learned in the European theatre, the U.S. is only recentlybeginning to move forward with grid scale projects. The U.S. Department of the Interior's Bureau of Oceanand Energy Management (BOEM) has, to date, leased fifteen Wind Energy Areas (WEAs) to developersalong the eastern continental shelf of the U.S which to date have auctioned for a total of over $472 million[3]. Furthermore, in October of 2019 the Environmental Business Counsel of New England held a discussionof OSW in the Gulf of Maine which coincides with the new BOEM Gulf of Maine IntergovernmentalRenewable Energy Task Force which has been chartered to facilitate coordination and consultation relatedto renewable energy planning activities in the Gulf of Maine. The first task force was held on December 12,2019 and BOEM predicts that the new lease areas will be developed within the next ten years. States havealso taken steps to support Offshore Wind development. As of 2020, 28 states and the District of Columbiastates have mandatory Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) which require that a specific percentage ofelectricity utilities sell come from renewable resources [4] while 7 other states have adopted voluntary RPSprograms. Several states have specific consideration for offshore wind by creating Offshore RenewableEnergy Credits (ORECs). For example, the Maryland Offshore Wind Energy Act of 2013 establishedORECs for sourcing 2.5% of the state's electricity supply from offshore wind [5]. Additionally, in 2019 NewJersey doubled its offshore wind commitment from 3,500 MW to 7,500 MW by 2035 [6]. Furthermore, other states have increased commitments to procure OSW such as Maine (5,000 MW by 2030), Massachusetts(3,200 MW by 2035), New York (9,000 MW by 2025), Connecticut (2,000 MW by 2030) and Virginia(2,500 MW by 2026) [7]. As of 2019, there are over 26 GW of OSW projects in the pipeline with a projectionof over 35GW of OSW construction just on the East Coast by 2035 [8]. With dramatically decreasingLevelised Costs of Energy and large scale proposed build out, offshore wind is projected to play a majorpart in the US electricity grid and economy. The history of offshore wind power has included some notable hurdles and set-backs. Where these weredue to fundamentals of design or analysis, large fleets of offshore assets were affected. Examples includefailures of gearboxes, grounted connections and accelerated blade surface erosion. As floating wind is scaledup, to minimise similar exposure to technical risks, formal processes will help to identify the novel features,novel applications and components with the highest risk. Assumptions about suitability of existing onshoreor offshore technical solutions must be challenged. Also care must be taken when using demonstrationprojects comprising single units as the basis for scaling up technologies. Currently, although monitored andscrutinised so as to be proven technically, these have comprised small-scale wind farms, under experimentalconditions."
i_1874,"Comparison of Materials: Comparing the environmental performance of different materials, such as clay-based bricks and concrete blocks, is straightforward and can be done without the need for robust methodologies or reliable data .","The establishment of sustainability credentials of emergent construction materials is very subjective, and most available tools such as BREEAM, CEQUAL, ARUP SpeAR among others are not fully quipped or equipped at all to deal with individual material systems. The main problem emanates from the challenges of the audit of each aspect of the material processing, and especially the quantification of the relevant transport, energy, environmental and other inputs into the composite product. Incorporation of materials with long and complex recycling processes further exacerbate the challenge. This paper reports on a simplified approach towards full Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of seven clay-based brick products developed in UK and in Spain, based on known material data and estimated energy inputs in the manufacturing processes. In order to test the robustness of the proposed approach, results on UK-based bricks are compared with a parallel LCA on clay-based product developed in Spain. Finally, the clay-based products are compared with a typical Portland cement-based concrete block and fired clay brick. In the LCA, boundary conditions include fixed transport, thus attempting to factor only the (i) material ingredients, (ii) their known atmospheric emissions, and (iii) estimated energy inputs during processing. Results suggest that the most challenging aspect in the undertaking of LCA is the availability of reliable input data. Results also show that there are numerous parameters that can reliably and corroboratively facilitate the comparison of performance, besides carbon dioxide emissions."

Integrating machine learning models can reduce the computational burden. For example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model was shown to reduce the computational time of ordinary kriging (OK) by at least an order of magnitude .","Ordinary Kriging (OK) is a popular geostatistical algorithm for spatial interpolation and estimation. The computational complexity of OK changes quadratically and cubically for memory and speed, respectively, given the number of data. Therefore, it is computationally intensive and also challenging to process a large set of data, especially in three-dimensional (3D) cases. This paper develops a geostatistics-informed machine learning (GIML) model to improve the efficiency of OK by reducing the number of points required to be estimated using OK. Specifically, only a very few of the unknown points are estimated by OK to get the weights and estimations, which are used as the training dataset. Moreover, the governing equations of OK are used to guide our proposed machine learning to better reproduce the spatial distributions. Our results show that the proposed GIML can reduce the computational time of OK by at least one order of magnitude. The effectiveness of the GIML is evaluated and compared using a 2D case. Furthermore, we demonstrate its efficiency and robustness by considering a different number of training samples on various 3D simulation grids."

The importance of packaging is when items are shipped around the world, which in recent years is on a daily basis. Though packaging ensures the safety and durability of the merchandise and carries the brand name of the seller, it leads to accumulated waste where most of these conventional packing materials cannot be recycled. With the large amount of companies transporting goods from factories to warehouses and then to retailers, as well as the enormous online orders placed daily, there is a massive amount of plastic waste such as Styrofoam, cardboard, and paper that are utilized in the process. However, sustainable packaging is a boon to this problem, which is referred to as Green packaging; it offers an environmental friendly alternative playing a great role in protecting products, preventing waste and enabling efficient business conduct promoting environmental sustainability. Sustainable packaging is made by recycling materials thereby reducing the waste during production or raw material processing. The manufacturing process of such packaging materials also tends to be more efficient, further minimizing resources needed and reducing the negative impact that the business has on the environment. Sustainable packaging is produced in an environmentally friendly manner through the use and reuse of biodegradable and recyclable materials and is considered energy efficient. As a part of Corporate Social Responsibility, sustainable packaging is a relatively new addition to the environmental considerations, where, reduced as well as ecofriendly material for packaging provide an attractive opportunity to promote environmental sustainability. Industries, Promoters and Companies using such packaging material not only reduce their carbon footprint but campaign the use of recycled materials minimizing waste generation. Through this, it is indirectly aimed at preserving the world's ecosystems, improving human life quality and viability for a longer period. Moreover, sustainable packaging is economically viable for both consumers and manufacturers additionally ensuring a cleaner environment for the future generations."
s_1993,"General Recycling Principles: Material Identification: While proper identification of materials is often claimed to be crucial for effective recycling, many plastic packages lack a resin identification code, which suggests that the presence of such codes is not as significant as previously thought for facilitating separation and recycling .","Packages have high rotation as they become municipal solid waste just after the consumption of the product. Therefore, packages should be labeled with identification of the material they are made of in order to help the recycling chain. Many products made from plastics show a resin identification code - usually from 1 to 7 inside a three-arrow triangle above a monogram - aimed at identifying the type of plastic the product is made of, and help its separation and later recycling. In other words, one aims to facilitate recovery of plastics discarded with the municipal solid waste. In this study we collected data on the resin identification code in flexible plastic packages to assess whether the guidelines for material identification are being followed. The data collection was performed in a total of 509 flexible plastic packages used for packing food and non-food products available in the Brazilian market. Even though the NBR 13230 Brazilian standard is already in its second revision, the resin identification code in plastic packages is still used in a very heterogeneous fashion. Approximately 50% of the packages had the resin identification code. Up to 30% of some packages showed incorrect material identification code. Therefore, misinformation still occurs in the Brazilian market concerning the type of material for plastic packaging - including lack of the resin identification code and incorrect form of identification code in the plastic packaging. Both of these problems have negative effects on the plastic recycling chain. We propose that other materials used in flexible plastic packages, e.g. aluminum foil, should also be identified, in order to make the separation and recycling easier."

Forward osmosis (FO), driven by the osmotic pressure difference between solutions divided by a semi‐permeable membrane, has been recognised as a potential energy‐efficient filtration process with a low tendency for fouling and a strong ability to filtrate highly polluted wastewater. The application of FO for wastewater treatment has received significant attention in research and attracted technological effort in recent years. In this review, we review the state‐of‐theart application of FO technology for sewage concentration and wastewater treatment both as an independent treatment process and in combination with other treatment processes.

Mangroves also play a process of disaster mitigation, especially to current and waves, erosion, and coastal abrasion. Mangrove, in functional status, will be able to protect the wave movement from sea to land. Except for tree density, the mangrove root's shown an ability to protect waves from the sea. The effort to conserve and protect coastal areas from climate and tsunami can be started from the local community in the coastal.

It looks at the technologies that have reshaped the tourism industry, giving rise to a new business model, online travel agencies, as well as the adoption of artificial intelligence. It also addresses key issues and debates, such as the impacts on consumer behavior and demand, business functions such as intermediaries, and marketing. The chapter concludes by turning to the spatial implications of this transformation.
[3]: The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the significance of how artificial intelligence and its applications enhance the customer experience by elevating the quality of the service delivered by the banking industry. A systematic study on the literature with respect to the various emerging applications of artificial intelligence and its impact on the banking sector is presented. Artificial intelligence certainly enhances the banking experience of millions of customers as well as the employees in the banking sector. Serving tens of thousands of customers on a daily basis is a quite more challenging task for bank employees and also risk needs to be handled in various stages of the banking process. Artificial intelligence facilitates various process to diminish the workload of the employees by furnishing credit score checking, system failure prediction, emergency alarm system, fraud detection, phishing websites detection, liquidity risk assessment, customer loyalty evaluation, and intelligence systems. On the other hand, customer experience is upgraded through diverse applications, namely, mobile banking, chat bots, and augmented reality. With the help of artificial intelligence, a well-structured dimension of the banks will be established. This chapter presents a detailed view of different applications of artificial intelligence and its role in the banking sector from a variety of literature papers, which acts as a path towards the future state of the banking industry."

In the first experiment, performance was assessed after transfer from 35‰ at eight salinity treatments (5‰, 10‰, 15‰, 20‰, 25‰ 30‰, 35‰ and 45‰) in larvae from 3 to 21 days after hatching (dah). Survival of larvae was best within the range of 20-35‰. Final size of larvae was similar within the range of 10-35‰ (6.8 ± 0.1 to 7.1 ± 0.2 mm total length [TL]; 3.0 ± 0.3 to 3.3 ± 0.3 mg wet weight) but larvae were 15% shorter at 45‰. Final swimbladder inflation and feeding onset of larvae was not affected by salinity in the range of 10-45‰. The presence of calculi in the urinary bladder of larvae was correlated positively with increasing salinity but no relationship between urinary calculi and larval survival was observed. In a second experiment, performance was assessed after transfer from 21°C at seven temperature treatments (15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30 and 33°C) in larvae from 3-21 dah. All larvae transferred from 21°C to 30°C and 33°C died after 3 days and from 21°C to 27°C died after 9 days. Survival was not significantly different between 15°C and 24°C. Larval growth increased as temperature was increased; larvae at 24°C (4.8 ± 0.2 mg wet weight) were 6-fold heavier than larvae at 15°C. Swimbladder inflation of larvae grown at 18°C, 21°C and 24°C was high (65.2 ± 18.0% to 86.7 ± 8.8%) and similar but inflation was lower in 15°C and 27°C. The incidence of urinary calculi occurred earlier and in a greater number of larvae when temperature was increased. Feeding onset was not affected by temperature. In a third experiment, performance was assessed at combinations of two salinities (20‰ and 35‰) and three temperatures (18°C, 21°C, and 24°C) in larvae from 3 to 24 dah. Survival of snapper larvae was not significantly different between these treatments. Growth was not affected by salinity but larvae increased in size as temperature was increased and there was no interaction of salinity and temperature. The percentage of larvae that commenced feeding and inflated their swimbladders was similar in all treatments. Salinity and temperature influenced the incidence of urinary calculi and there was an interaction between the parameters. Based on our results in terms of larval performance (growth), development and survival, we conclude that the optimal conditions for larval rearing of snapper from first-feeding (3 dah) to pre-metamorphosis (24 dah) are combinations of salinity from 20‰ to 35‰ and a temperature of 24°C. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Infrastructure and Financial Support: Public-Private Partnerships: Leveraging public-private partnerships to improve infrastructure, such as irrigation systems and transportation networks, can enhance agricultural productivity and market access .","The capacity of the Government of Indonesia to grow the country to be developed country in 2025 as mentioned in The Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's Economic Development (abbreviated MP3EI) faces many challenges, one of them is financial capacity. Huge archipelago like Indonesia needs to be connected by good infrastructure, especially airport, and it's needed a big amount of money that the government still can afford it. The government realizes the limitation in funding the infrastructure needs. The government comes with the concept to form the cooperation with private sectors as known as a Public Private Partnership (PPP). The national planning agency in Indonesia for PPP planning and implementation issues the PPP book to provide potential investors the information on available infrastructure investment in Indonesia. Project listed in PPP Book are results of rigorous review and screening process by national planning agency. The projects are organized into potential projects, prospective projects, and ready to offer projects. The airport projects obtain the potential income from international flights and the forecast of passengers becomes the main factor in increasing the development of infrastructure. The PPP schemes is expected to fulfill the financial problems in infrastructure service providing. However, the private participation is expected not only to fill the funding but also to share experience and knowledge in the development, operation, and management of qualified infrastructure service. Therefore, the aim of the study is to develop risk mitigation strategy for airport infrastructure development projects and expected to be problem solving for the lack of succession of PPP and can be a solution for acceleration of infrastructure development in Indonesia. The research study was conducted by collecting data at several airports in Indonesia. The data used were primary and secondary data. The primary based upon field survey, while secondary according to the study on the various literatures of the success with the implementation of PPP in Indonesia and abroad. The findings and recommendations for the study are risk response and risk strategy in order to address of each risk that already identified.

Safety and Efficacy: The application of Cu-NPs in aquaculture must balance efficacy against pathogens with the potential for toxicity to aquatic organisms. Lower, eco-relevant doses may mitigate adverse effects while providing antimicrobial benefits .","Copper nanoparticles (Cu-NPs)are serious water pollutants but their impact in teleosts performance remains poorly understood. In the present study, we have exposed juvenile carps (Cyprinus carpio), a freshwater teleost edible in India to two different doses (20 and 100 μg/L)of Cu-NPs for seven days. The doses selected were eco-relevant considering the contamination levels of certain water resources. The results indicated that the activity oxidative stress enzymes catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione-S-transferase were significantly increased in the kidney, liver and gills of the treated groups when compared to control. Histological analysis revealed that after exposure, disruption of the secondary lamellae of gills, liver damage with pyknotic nuclei and structural disarray of the kidney occurred. Proteomic analysis of the liver showed down-regulation of several proteins including the ferritin heavy chain, rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 17-like, cytoglobin-1 and up-regulation of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase and selenide & water dikinase-1. Taken together, the results of suggest that short-term exposure of juvenile carp to Cu-NPs causes oxidative stress and impart serious deleterious effects in the tissues which may affect fish growth and development.
[6]: Copper nanoparticles were synthesized using Rhus punjabensis leaf extract and assessed for toxicity in vitro against brine shrimp Leishmania tropica and in vivo against Sprague–Dawley rats. The spherical biofunctionalized nanoparticles showed concentration and time-dependent toxicity during in vitro assays. Biocompatibility assessed against Sprague–Dawley rats at 50 and 100 mg/kg (low and high dose) depicted significant variation only in total bilirubin, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase in both male and female rats at both dose administration; however, non-significant change was recorded on other parameters. Antioxidative enzymes, total proteins, and nitrites also showed significant variation from control in both genders. Histological study revealed alteration in liver, heart, and lungs of male rats on higher dose administration, while female rats on low-dose administration were found safer. The results show that R. punjabensis-mediated CuO nanoparticles are safe at low dose and its application can be expanded as effectual antimicrobial and anticancer agents for pharmaceutical applications."
i_2149,"Physiological and Biochemical Changes: Respiratory Enzymes: The presence of heavy metals significantly alters the expression of key respiratory enzymes such as cytochrome oxidase, isocitrate dehydrogenase, and malate dehydrogenase, which invariably leads to a decrease in respiration rates in wheat .","The toxic effects of heavy metals, including arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), on length and biomass of shoots and roots, their respiratory rate, the gene expression levels of cytochrome oxidase (COD), isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) isoenzymes were studied in the germination stage of wheat (var. ZhengZhou-9023). The results showed that both length and total dry biomass of wheat shoot and root increased at lower As concentrations (1 mg·L <sup>-1</sup>) but decreased gradually at higher As concentrations (5 to 25 mg·L <sup>-1</sup>). Similarly, the increase in the concentration of Pb, increased shoot length and biomass initially but later decreased gradually. Decline of root and shoot's biomass was observed with increasing concentrations of Cd yet. The respiratory rate of root displayed an increasing trend at As concentrations lower than 1 mg·L <sup>-1</sup>, but a decreasing trend was observed at higher concentrations in the root respiratory rate, while the respiratory rate of shoot increased gradually. Respiratory rates of shoot and root increased at lower concentrations of Cd or Pb but decreased at higher concentrations overall. The levels of COD, IDH and MDH isoenzymes in shoot and root were induced mainly with increasing concentrations of As. Interestingly, their levels were induced at lower concentrations of Cd and Pb, but could not be measured at higher concentrations of them. However, expression of a new IDH or a new MDH isoenzyme homologue in the root was induced at higher concentrations of Cd or Pb. Therefore, the presence of heavy metals could change the expression of some important enzymes in respiratory process such as COD, IDH or MDH isoenzymes, thereby affecting respiration in wheat, eventually leading to physiological changes in Wheat. © 2011 Academic Journals."
s_596,"Key Points: Technology Utilized: Depth-Sensing Camera: This depth-sensing camera captures real-time image sequences to visualize thoracic and abdominal movements.

A Microsoft Kinect sensor was used to visualize the variations in the thorax and abdomen from the respiratory rhythm. These variations were magnified, analyzed and detected at a distance of 2.5 m from the subject. A modified motion magnification system and frame subtraction technique were used to identify breathing movements by detecting rapid motion areas in the magnified frame sequences. The experimental results on a set of video data from five subjects (3 h for each subject) showed that our monitoring system can accurately measure respiratory rate and therefore detect apnoea in infants and young children. The proposed system is feasible, accurate, safe and low computational complexity, making it an efficient alternative for non-contact home sleep monitoring systems and advancing health care applications."
s_186,"Privacy Concerns: The ability of video surveillance systems to identify and track individuals raises privacy issues. The integration of IoT devices can exacerbate these concerns due to the potential for unauthorized data collection and misuse . For instance, the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces can lead to unauthorized surveillance and data archiving.","Present-day video surveillance systems often come with high-speed network connections, high processing power, and plenty of storage capacity. These computational capabilities enable the deployment of sophisticated computer vision algorithms that make it possible to find people [1], detect faces [2], recognize faces [3], and analyze the activity of people [4]. As a result, video surveillance systems are increasingly getting better at detecting terrorists and acts of crime, enhancing our sense of security. However, the increasing ability of video surveillance systems to successfully identify people has raised several privacy concerns during the past few years. Indeed, such concerns have, for instance, been voiced with respect to the use of FR technology in public spaces, archiving face images for possible later use, the unauthorized addition of face images to watch lists, and power abuse by guards [5]. In addition, large-scale FR systems, possibly built by making use of face images and corresponding name labels shared on social media applications [6], have the potential to further intrude upon the privacy of individuals in the foreseeable future.
[3]: Visual surveillance has numerous applications. It can support public safety, traffic monitoring, and facility protection to name just a few. Networked digital surveillance devices are revolutionizing the surveillance industry by supporting high quality images, remote monitoring, and advanced image processing. However, they also raise serious privacy/security concerns. To address the issue, the surveillance industry has recently begun to provide basic support for secure communications. In this paper, we present a new protocol to significantly enhance the security and performance compared with the state-of-the-art baseline method widely taken in the video surveillance industry. Through extensive experiments for performance evaluation, our approach is shown to substantially reduce the delay to execute cryptographic mechanisms and increase the supported bit rate compared with the baseline, while providing desirable security features."
s_893,"Supercapacitors are often considered to have significantly lower specific energy than batteries, which makes them less effective for energy storage, despite their high power density .","Supercapacitors are an electrochemical component with high-power density and an intermediate energy density between batteries and conventional capacitors. They are characterized by low series resistance, significant equivalent capacitance and long service life. Nowadays, they become an attractive alternative storage device for several applications. However, supercapacitors are subject to degradation due to aging, in addition to other factors, such as temperature and high voltage. Hence, there is a need to understand both electrical and energetic behavior of supercapacitor and to identify its capacitance and resistance during functioning. Such information is important to determine its state of health. Several electric models of supercapacitors, which characterize their real behavior, have been proposed in literature, like RC model. The purpose of this paper is the real-time estimation of RC model parameters, capacity and resistance, using recursive least squares method. The parameter values obtained with this method show a good correlation with real values of capacity and resistance using Maxwell test."

Decreased Resource Use and Waste Generation: Postponing maintenance can actually lead to less severe pavement deterioration, requiring fewer repairs that consume fewer materials and generate less waste. This aligns with preventive maintenance, which uses more resources and generates more waste over the pavement's lifecycle .","Purpose Although a significant number of environmental protection measures concerning industrial products and processes have emerged over the past few years, similar measures have only started to appear in road construction and related practices. There is a need for understanding what a ""sustainable pavement"" would entail in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption. Since environmental impact assessment of major projects is becoming mandatory in many countries, various research projects attempt to evaluate the environmental impact of different pavement materials, technologies, or processes over the road life cycle. To support these efforts, there is a need to measure and describe different aspects of sustainability related to road pavements. In particular, keeping road pavements at high service levels through a preventive maintenance approach during the pavement service life has been proven to provide significant improvement of their performance and reduce their deterioration rate. Methodology This paper describes an innovative methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of preventive maintenance activities. It relates these activities to performance and cost during the service life of the pavement through a multi-attribute ""life cycle cost, performance, and environmental analysis"". Emissions and energy saved adopting several preventive maintenance strategies were computed, relating them to cost and performance. Equipment and materials usually involved in road maintenance practices were also analyzed in order to assess specific fuel consumption and energy spent. An ad hoc index was ultimately created, adopting a script file to evaluate the best strategy through the multi-attribute approach. Results and conclusions Results show how eco-effective it can be to improve pavement management practices on roads by implementing energy efficient treatments and strategies. Furthermore, eco-saving factors could represent a new and innovative feature to be added in the sustainability assessment process for pavements to evaluate different alternatives and assist authorities choosing between different investment solutions as a part of a decision support system. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."
i_2066,"Process of Water Movement: Transport through Xylem: Water moves upward through the xylem vessels in the stem and branches primarily due to the cohesion-tension mechanism, which is solely driven by transpiration pull, ignoring other factors that may influence this process .","The water transport in terrestrial vascular plants is passive and is determined by the transpiration or loss of water through the leaves. The cohesion-tension theory is the most accepted to explain this process, which is complemented by the Ohm's law analogy, which analyzes the flow of water as a catenary process. Resistance to water stress and cavitation is strongly associated with the anatomical characteristics of the xylem, the intervessel pits, and their membranes, the latter being altered depending on the chemical properties of the aqueous solution that flows through them. Based on these premises, this review addresses the phenomenon of ascent of water in terrestrial vascular plants and analyzes the concepts, theories, and methods most used in the study of hydraulic architecture. In addition, it points out the differences in xylem structure and water transport between dicots and monocots.
[4]: The xylem is one of the two long distance transport tissues in plants, providing a low resistance pathway for water movement from roots to leaves. Its properties determine how much water can be transported and transpired and, at the same time, the plant's vulnerability to transport dysfunctions (the formation and propagation of emboli) associated to important stress factors, such as droughts and frost. Both maximum transport efficiency and safety against embolism have classically been attributed to the properties of individual conduits or of the pit membrane connecting them. But this approach overlooks the fact that the conduits of the xylem constitute a network. The topology of this network is likely to affect its overall transport properties, as well as the propagation of embolism through the xylem, since, according to the air-seeding hypothesis, drought-induced embolism propagates as a contact process (i.e., between neighbouring conduits). Here we present a model of the xylem that takes into account its system-level properties, including the connectivity of the xylem network. With the tools of graph theory and assuming steady state and Darcy's flow we calculated the hydraulic conductivity of idealized wood segments at different water potentials. A Monte Carlo approach was adopted, varying the anatomical and topological properties of the segments within biologically reasonable ranges, based on data available from the literature. Our results showed that maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to embolism increase with the connectivity of the xylem network. This can be explained by the fact that connectivity determines the fraction of all the potential paths or conduits actually available for water transport and spread of embolism. It is concluded that the xylem can no longer be interpreted as the mere sum of its conduits, because the spatial arrangement of those conduits in the xylem network influences the main functional properties of this tissue. This brings new arguments into the long-standing discussion on the efficiency vs. safety trade-off in the plants' xylem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
s_894,"The specific energy of a module can exceed that of an individual cell, making lower specific energy cells equally viable options .","A major disadvantage of supercapacitors in comparison with batteries is significantly lower specific energy. By assembling of six packaged supercapacitor cells of 3000 F and 2.5 V into a packaged module, a decrease of the maximum specific energy from 4.7 Wh/kg for an individual cell to 2.7 Wh/kg for the module takes place. Such values are related to high performance supercapacitor cells/modules available as commercial products at this time. Elimination of the cell packages and direct connection in series of the six cell coils results in specific energy higher than 3 Wh/kg towards 4 Wh/kg due to reduction in the module's weight. Because the specific energy of a module cannot be higher than that of a component cell, higher specific energy for supercapacitor cells is required. Further increase of the specific capacitance from 15-20 F/g to values higher than 100 F/g by improvement of the manufacturing process can enable higher specific energy. ©2008 IEEE."

i_1636,"The presence of green spaces may act as a protective factor against air pollution-related mortality, especially in urban areas, but it is unclear if this effect is significant enough to outweigh the risks posed by high levels of air pollution .","Background: Both air pollution and green space have been shown to affect health. We aimed to assess whether greenness protects against air pollution-related mortality. Methods: We used data from the 2008 wave of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. We calculated contemporaneous normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the 500 m radius around each participant's residence. Fine particulate matter (PM<inf>2·5</inf>) concentration was calculated using 3-year average concentrations in 1 km × 1 km grid resolution. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the effects of NDVI, PM<inf>2·5</inf>, and their interaction on all-cause mortality, adjusted for a range of covariates. Findings: The cohort contained 12 873 participants, totalling 47 884 person-years. There were 7426 deaths between 2008 and 2014. The mean contemporaneous NDVI was 0·42 (SD 0·21), and the mean 3-year average PM<inf>2·5</inf> was 49·63 μg/m<sup>3</sup> (13·72). In the fully adjusted model, the mortality hazard ratio for each 0·1-unit decrease in contemporaneous NDVI was 1·08 (95% CI 1·03–1·13), each 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> increase in PM<inf>2·5</inf> was 1·13 (1·09–1·18), and the interaction term was 1·01 (1·00–1·02) with a p value of 0·027. We observed non-linear associations in our stratified analyses: people living in urban areas were more likely to benefit from greenness, and people living in rural areas were more likely to be harmed by air pollution. Interpretation: Our study showed some indication of a synergistic effect of greenness and air pollution, suggesting that green space planning and air pollution control can jointly improve public health.

i_1335,"Chondrosarcoma: This cancer originates from mesenchymal cells and is often associated with various genetic mutations, although specific chromosomal translocations are less defined compared to Ewing Sarcoma .","Osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma are the most common bone malignancies that affect children and adolescents, with an incidence of six new cases/1,000,000 inhabitants/year, accounting for approximately 7% of cancer diagnoses. They may be defined as neoplastic diseases that involve the bone tissues, the former arising from the mesenchymal bone forming cells and the latter from the neural crest cells.
[2]: Primary bone cancers are rare neoplasms, with osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma the 3 most common forms. Chondrosarcoma is usually found in middle-aged and older adults. Wide excision is the preferred treatment for resectable low- and high-grade chondrosarcomas. Intralesional excision with or without adjuvant therapy is an alternative option for low-grade lesions. In small series of reports, the addition of chemotherapy improved outcomes in patients with mesenchymal chondrosarcomas. However, the role of chemotherapy in the treatment of chondrosarcomas is not yet defined. Ewing's sarcoma is characterized by a chromosomal translocation t(11;22), resulting in the fusion of EWS gene with various members of the ETS family of genes, and develops mainly in children and young adults. Multiagent chemotherapy is the primary treatment for patients with Ewing's sarcoma. Patients who experience response to primary treatment are treated with local control therapy (surgery or radiation) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. Progressive disease is best managed with RT with or without surgery followed by chemotherapy or best supportive care. Osteosarcoma occurs mainly in children and young adults. Wide excision is the primary treatment for patients with low-grade osteosarcomas, whereas preoperative chemotherapy is preferred before wide excision for high-grade osteosarcoma and periosteal lesions. After wide excision (for resectable lesions), postoperative chemotherapy is recommended for patients with low-grade or periosteal sarcomas with pathologic findings of high-grade disease and those with high-grade sarcoma. RT followed by adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended if the sarcoma remains unresectable after preoperative chemotherapy. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease should be treated with second-line therapy. Participation in a clinical trial should be strongly encouraged for patients experiencing progressive disease after second-line therapy. The development of multiagent chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment has considerably improved the prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma and Ewing's sarcoma. A small subset of patients diagnosed with metastatic disease at presentation can be cured with the proper treatment.

Resistance Assay: Includes various methods such as in vitro assays, feeding disruption tests, and other bioassays to evaluate resistance. Turnaround Time: Resistance Test: Genotypic tests are faster (a few days), while phenotypic tests can take longer (up to four weeks) . Resistance Assay: The time can vary widely depending on the specific assay used.","Background Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) drug resistance is a significant public health concern among immunocompromised individuals. Phenotypic assays are considered the gold standard method for detecting HSV drug resistance. However, plaque reduction assays (PRAs) are technically demanding, often with long turnaround times of up to four weeks. In contrast, genotypic tests can be performed within a few days. Objectives The development and coordination of the first European External Quality Assessment (EQA) study to evaluate phenotypic and genotypic methods used for HSV drug resistance testing in specialised reference laboratories. Study design Four HSV-1 or HSV-2 strains with different antiviral susceptibility profiles were isolated from clinical samples. Isolates were quantified by qPCR, and aliquoted in culture medium. One isolate was distributed at two dilutions to help assess assay sensitivity. The panel was distributed to five European centres with a six-week deadline for the return of phenotypic and genotypic results, together with clinical reports. Results Four out of five participating labs returned results by the deadline. Limited results were later available from the fifth lab. Phenotypic and genotypic data were largely, but not completely, concordant. An unusual resistance profile shown by one of the samples was explained by the detection of a mixed virus population after extensive further investigation by one of the centres. Conclusions Discordant clinical outputs reflecting the diversity of phenotypic methodologies demonstrated the utility of this exercise. With emerging genotypic technologies looking to supplant phenotyping, there is a need for curated public databases, accessible interpretation tools and standardised control materials for quality management. By establishing a network of testing laboratories, we hope that this EQA scheme will facilitate ongoing progress in this area."

Thus, effective interventions to reduce stroke impact on the family are needed. Objectives: To evaluate the content validity and satisfaction of a caregiver-focused web-based intervention designed to improve stroke survivor physical function while reducing caregiver negative outcomes. Methods: Caregivers of individuals with stroke (N = 6) and expert rehabilitation researchers (N = 4) were presented with a novel, web-based intervention (CARE-CITE) designed to foster problem-solving and skill-building while facilitating caregiver involvement during constraint-induced movement therapy. Caregivers rated CARE-CITE for usefulness, ease of use, acceptability, and time to complete. Rehabilitation experts evaluated content for accuracy, feasibility, acceptability, problem relevance and ease of use. Ratings were assessed using a five-point Likert-type response scales (1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree). Results: On average, all caregivers agreed or strongly agreed that the modules were useful (4.42), easy to use (4.60), and acceptable (4.41). Mean total satisfaction score was 4.45, and average review time was 15 min per module. Expert reviewers agreed or strongly agreed that each module was accurate (4.95), feasible (4.8), easy to use (4.86), acceptable (4.96), and had appropriate problem relevance (4.65).

[5]: Background and Purpose - There are few evidence-based programs for stroke family caregivers postdischarge. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of the Telephone Assessment and Skill-Building Kit (TASK II), a nurse-led intervention enabling caregivers to build skills based on assessment of their own needs. Methods - A total of 254 stroke caregivers (primarily female TASK II/information, support, and referral 78.0%/78.6%; white 70.7%/72.1%; about half spouses 48.4%/46.6%) were randomized to the TASK II intervention (n=123) or to an information, support, and referral group (n=131). Both groups received 8 weekly telephone sessions, with a booster at 12 weeks. General linear models with repeated measures tested efficacy, controlling for patient hospital days and call minutes. Prespecified 8-week primary outcomes were depressive symptoms (with Patient Health Questionnaire Depressive Symptom Scale PHQ-9 ≥5), life changes, and unhealthy days. Results - Among caregivers with baseline PHQ-9 ≥5, those randomized to the TASK II intervention had a greater reduction in depressive symptoms from baseline to 8, 24, and 52 weeks and greater improvement in life changes from baseline to 12 weeks compared with the information, support, and referral group (P<0.05); but not found for the total sample. Although not sustained at 12, 24, or 52 weeks, caregivers randomized to the TASK II intervention had a relatively greater reduction in unhealthy days from baseline to 8 weeks (P<0.05). Conclusions - The TASK II intervention reduced depressive symptoms and improved life changes for caregivers with mild to severe depressive symptoms.

We observed that the tomato plant–Trichoderma P1 interaction had a negative impact on the development of moth larvae and on aphid longevity. These effects were attributed to a plant response induced by Trichoderma that was associated with transcriptional changes of a wide array of defense-related genes. While the impact on aphids could be related to the up-regulation of genes involved in the oxidative burst reaction, which occur early in the defense reaction, the negative performance of moth larvae was associated with the enhanced expression of genes encoding for protective enzymes (i.e., Proteinase inhibitor I (PI), Threonine deaminase, Leucine aminopeptidase A1, Arginase 2, and Polyphenol oxidase) that are activated downstream in the defense cascade. In addition, Trichoderma P1 produced alterations in plant metabolic pathways leading to the production and release of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are involved in the attraction of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi, thus reinforcing the indirect plant defense barriers. Our findings, along with the evidence available in the literature, indicate that the outcome of the tripartite interaction among plant, Trichoderma, and pests is highly specific and only a comprehensive approach, integrating both insect phenotypic changes and plant transcriptomic alterations, can allow a reliable prediction of its potential for plant protection.
[15]: Trichoderma spp. are a rich source of secondary metabolites and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which may induce plant defenses and modulate plant growth. In filamentous fungi, chromatin modifications regulate secondary metabolism. In this study we investigated how the absence of histone deacetylase HDA-2 in the Trichoderma atroviride strain Dhda-2 impacts its effect on a host, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The production of VOCs and their impact on plant growth and development were assessed as well. The Dhda-2 strain was impaired in its ability to colonize Arabidopsis roots, thus affecting the promotion of plant growth and modulation of plant defenses against foliar pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Pseudomonas syringae, which normally result from interaction with T. atroviride. Furthermore, Dhda-2 VOCs were incapable of triggering plant defenses to counterattack foliar pathogens. The Dhda-2 overproduced the VOC 6-pentyl-2H-pyran-2-one (6-PP), which resulted in enhanced root branching and differentially regulated phytohormone-related genes. Analysis of ten VOCs (including 6-PP) revealed that three of them positively regulated plant growth, whereas six had the opposite effect. Assessment of secondary metabolites, detoxification, and communication with plant-related genes showed a dual role for HDA-2 in T. atroviride gene expression regulation during its interaction with plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation of acetylated histone H3 on the promoters of plant-responsive genes in Dhda-2 showed, in the presence of Arabidopsis, low levels of epl-1 and abc-2 compared with that in the wild type; whereas ctf- 1 presented high constitutive levels, supporting a dual role of HDA-2 in gene regulation. This work highlights the importance of HDA-2 as a global regulator in Trichoderma to modulate multiple responses in Arabidopsis."
i_626,Technologies like LiDAR can be used to detect potential landslide hazards and monitor surface displacements .,"In recent years, geological disasters like landslides have often occurred within the Markam area, which is located in the southeastern part of Tibet Autonomous Region. The stability of these landslides is affected by factors such as physical geographical/meteorological conditions and anthropogenic activities. These factors pose great threats to power grid construction/operation, major transportations, and public security. Hence, effective technologies are needed to detect potential landslide hazards within this area and provide key supports for decision making regarding disaster prevention and reduction. This study employed the small baseline subset InSAR technique to process archived SAR data stacks acquired by ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR covering the Markam area. A few suspected landslide hazard sites are identified along National Highway 318 and the Valley of Jinsha River. Spatial distribution and temporal evolution patterns of the surface displacements upon these unstable slopes are characterized."
s_116,"Sources of Epistemic Bias in AI-Generated Texts: Language-Specific Bias: Different languages may exhibit varying frequencies and uses of epistemic modal verbs, which can influence the perceived certainty and inferential ground of statements. For example, German uses the epistemic modal verb 'müssen' more frequently and in a broader range of contexts compared to its Dutch and English counterparts .","This paper investigates the uses of epistemic must and its Dutch and German cognates moeten and müssen. Starting point is the observation that epistemic must occurs remarkably more often in English than its immediate counterparts in the two other languages. By means of a detailed comparison on the basis of a self-compiled English-Dutch-German translation corpus of fictional texts, this paper identifies the factors determining these frequency differences. First, it appears that English must covers a wider inferential ground than its Dutch and German counterparts, as it can also code highly subjective 'conjectural' inferences apart from the typical must-inferences based on observable evidence and general knowledge. Second, epistemic must is often used to appeal to the addressee, to invoke the addressee's sympathy among other things. Such intersubjective uses of epistemic must seem to be rare with the German and Dutch cognates. Third, general communicative preferences in English promote the use of hedging devices (like epistemic modal verbs), as they contribute to an indirect and addressee-oriented way of interaction that is more valued in English than in German. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."
i_1678,"Challenges in Monitoring Air Quality and Microplastic Concentrations: Contamination Control: Microplastics are ubiquitous, including in indoor air, which means that contamination control is crucial. Many studies fail to comply with essential contamination control measures, leading to potential overestimation of microplastic concentrations. Only about 40% of studies reviewed comply with basic contamination control measures such as avoiding plastic materials and covering samples .","Microplastics are widely distributed environmental contaminants. To understand their impacts on the environment and health, more high-quality results are needed. Since microplastics are present in every environment, including indoor air, proper precautions must be adopted in order to prevent contamination of samples and overestimation of environmental concentrations. Thus, to guarantee a proper quality of results, researchers must adopt strict contamination control measures. This review was conducted to understand current contamination control practices. A total of 50 studies published in 2019 were reviewed, including sampling of biota, air, soil, sediment, freshwater and saltwater, regarding 10 contamination control parameters. Overall, studies usually only comply with 4 out of 10 of these measures, which include avoiding the use of plastic materials, covering samples with glass lids or aluminum foil, filtering solutions, or running procedural blanks. The importance of these measures is also exemplified with real observation of contamination. Finally, seven measures to control for contamination are suggested in order to improve the quality of results in microplastic sampling in future assessments."
i_1723,"2. Factors Influencing CO₂ Generation: The mineralization of organic carbon, which is the process of converting organic carbon into CO₂, is influenced by factors such as water level and temperature. For example, in a saline lake, different water level treatments affected the mineralization rates of sediment organic carbon, suggesting that higher water levels always lead to higher mineralization rates, despite evidence that lower levels can also enhance mineralization under certain conditions .","The loss of organic carbon during passage through the continuum of inland waters from soils to the sea is a critical issue for the global carbon cycle. However, the amount of organic carbon mineralized and released to the atmosphere during its transport remains an open question, hampered by the absence of predictors of organic carbon mineralization rates. The lake water level can be affected by human disturbance and climate change, and thus change the mineralization of the sediment organic carbon. The primary objective of this study was to study the influence of different water level gradients on the mineralization of sediment organic carbon in a saline lake in arid region. Sediments at 0-50 cm depth were sampled from Lake Barkol. The mineralization rates of sediment organic carbon were measured by Li-COR 8100A under five underground water level treatments (T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 represent underground water level 0, -9, -23, -34 and -45 cm) were settled and sediment organic carbon mineralization rates were measured by Li-COR 8100A. Results showed the mineralization rates of sediment organic carbon under T1, T2 and T3 treatments were higher (0-10 d) at the beginning of the experiment, and then decreased slowly. The carbon mineralization rates under T4 and T5 treatments increased firstly and then decreased. The mineralization rate of organic carbon under T1 treatment was 1.09, 3.31 and 3.57 times higher than that under T2, T4 and T5 treatments, respectively. The cumulative mineralization of sediment organic carbon under different treatments is T3>T1>T2>T4>T5. The ratios of cumulative mineralization of organic carbon (C<inf>t</inf>) to total sediment organic carbon (C<inf>0</inf>) (C<inf>t</inf>/C<inf>0</inf>) are ranged from 1.2% to 4.4%, and the ratios of potential organic carbon emissions (C<inf>i</inf>) to C<inf>0</inf>(C<inf>i</inf>/C<inf>0</inf>) are ranged from 1.8% to 4.5%. The decrease of underground water level reduced the mineralization constant (k value) of sediment organic carbon. The k value under T1 treatment was max (0.137 d), and that under T4 treatment was lowest (0.032 d). The best fitting model explaining the relationship between sediment organic carbon mineralization rate and water level (x, cm) was C<inf>r</inf>=0.008x+0.488. There were significant positive relationships between organic carbon mineralization rate and sediment temperature at 5 cm depth. Water level had significant effect on the temperature sensitive of sediment organic carbon mineralization (Q<inf>10</inf>). The Q<inf>10</inf> was highest under T5 treatment (2.92), followed by T4 (2.54), and the T1 treatment had the smallest value (1.92). These results indicated that the decrease of underground water level would reduce the mineralization rate of organic carbon and increas Q<inf>10</inf>. The continuous decline of underground water level inhibits organic carbon mineralization, which may be a mechanism to maintain the stability of carbon pools of lake sediment in arid regions."
s_1845,"Changes in leaf biochemistry, such as nitrogen content and chlorophyll levels, cannot be detected using specific spectral indices. These biochemical properties do not influence the absorption and reflectance properties of leaves, which cannot be monitored using remote sensing techniques .","This study was conducted to investigate variations of leaf chlorophyll content and surface spectral reflectance of different tree species across contrasting terrain in the Nanjenshan Reserve of Kenting National Park, southern Taiwan. Tree species composition and forest types vary because of intense northeast monsoons that frequent this area. In this study, we used several remote sensing technique indices - normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), modified normalized difference vegetation index (mNDVI), simple ratio (SR), and modified simple ratio (mSR) - to analyze the spectral reflectance data collected from portable spectroradiometers and the GER 1500 and CM1000 chlorophyll meters to estimate leaf chlorophyll content. The results showed that significant differences (P<0.01) arose only among the modified indices mSR 705 nm and mNDVI 705 nm. The index mNDVI705 seemed more sensitive to detecting chlorophyll content in a wide range of tree species across a terrain. Among the indices tested, the mNDVI consistently deviated from the general relationship between chlorophyll content and spectral reflection in different vegetation. The findings indicated that the modified indices were better at studying different tree species than normalized indices across terrain.
[4]: Vegetation biochemistry is a critical driver of the forest carbon and water cycle and the fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. As result, monitoring biochemistry is a key to improving our estimates of the terrestrial carbon and energy budget. While destructive sampling techniques have been widely applied to determine nutrient content in foliage, scaling of these measurements to the stand and landscape is challenging. As an alternative to traditional field-based approaches, optical remote sensing is a powerful technique for sampling biochemical constituents in a spatially continuous fashion. Remote sensing of biochemical constituents is based on the understanding that leaf biochemistry is closely linked to absorption and reflectance properties in characteristic, often spectrally narrow, wavebands. Spectral absorption features can be identified to characterize and quantify biochemical properties at the leaf, stand and landscape level. At the same time, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing can allow inference about the impact of leaf biochemistry on tree growth and canopy structure. In this study, we report the effect of nitrogen-fertilization of a Douglas-fir dominated forest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada using active and passive remote sensing techniques. Leaf pigment concentrations were estimated from inversion of a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) and canopy nitrogen (N) was inferred from an airborne imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS). The impact of leaf biochemistry on canopy structure and tree growth was then investigated using a temporal sequence of LiDAR data acquired two years before, and after, the fertilization treatment. Results indicate that while fertilization had a significant impact on canopy pigment concentrations, it did not impact canopy nitrogen. A notable increase in tree growth was found for younger stands of less than 15. m of height, but not for more mature stand with taller trees. Fertilization had no immediate impact on canopy density measured from LiDAR derived leaf area and canopy volume. The use of advanced remote sensing tools and techniques such as those demonstrated in this study can be a powerful addition to ongoing efforts to model carbon and water fluxes throughout the landscape. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
[5]: The present study explored the use of narrow-band indices formulated in the visible spectral region at leaf and canopy levels to estimate carotenoid content. The research area was a pine forest affected by decline processes. Spectral reflectance and pigment content including chlorophylls a and b (Ca+b), carotenoid (Cx+c) and xanthophyll cycle pigments (VAZ) were measured in needles for two consecutive years. The study was conducted using radiative transfer modeling methods and high-resolution airborne imagery acquired at 10nm FWHM bandwidth. Airborne data consisted of high spatial resolution imagery acquired with a narrow-band multispectral camera on board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The imagery had 50cm resolution and six spectral bands in the 500-800nm range, enabling the identification of pure crowns to obtain the reflectance of individual trees. The indices evaluated were traditional formulations and new simple ratios developed by combining bands sensitive to Cx+c absorption in the 500-600nm region. The PROSPECT-5 model was coupled with the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model to explore the performance of Cx+c-sensitive vegetation indices at leaf and canopy levels. The sensitivity of these indices to structural effects was assessed to study the potential scaling-up of Cx+c-related vegetation indices on heterogeneous canopies. Coefficients of determination between Cx+c content and narrow-band vegetation indices revealed that traditional indices were highly related with Cx+c content at leaf level (r <sup>2</sup>>0.90; P<0.001 for the CRI index (1/R <inf>515</inf>)-(1/R <inf>550</inf>)) but highly affected by structural parameters at crown level (r <sup>2</sup>>0.44; P<0.001). A new simple-ratio vegetation index proposed in this study (R <inf>515</inf>/R <inf>570</inf>) was found to be significantly related with Cx+c content both at leaf (r <sup>2</sup>>0.72; P<0.001) and canopy levels (r <sup>2</sup>>0.71; P<0.001). Remote sensing cameras on board UAV platforms can provide very high multispectral and hyperspectral imagery for mapping biochemical constituents in heterogeneous forest canopies. This study demonstrates the feasibility of mapping carotenoid content to assess the physiological condition of forests. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."
i_666,"###  ** Thermal Safety and Management** Thermal Runaway: One of the primary safety concerns is thermal runaway, where the battery's temperature increases uncontrollably, potentially leading to fires or explosions. Techniques such as using a Cone Calorimeter to measure heat release rates and total energy released during combustion events help in quantifying thermal hazards and developing fire risk mitigation strategies. Additionally, it is believed that advancements in battery management systems could further enhance the safety of Li-ion batteries, although specific impacts of these systems on thermal runaway incidents remain to be fully validated .","The emergence of Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) as a viable means of transportation has been coincident with the development of lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery technology and electronics. These developments have enabled the storage and use of large amounts of energy that were previously only possible with internal combustion engines. However, the safety aspects of using these large energy storage battery packs are a significant challenge to address. In addition, the rapid advances in electrode and electrolyte materials for Li-Ion batteries have made comparisons and ranking of safety parameters difficult because of the substantial variations in cell designs. In this work, we outline a method for quantifying the thermal safety aspects of Li-ion battery technologies using a Cone Calorimeter. The Cone Calorimeter is a suitable tool to measure and quantify critical information such as the heat release rate and total energy released from the combustion of organic material. Such techniques cannot be directly applied to study the energy release characteristics, during combustion, of non-organic and energetic material like Li-ion cells. Combining data from the Cone Calorimeter with compositional analysis of the Li-ion cell components, we have adapted a calorimetric procedure to better quantify the heat release rate and the total energy released from cells when they undergo a combustion event. Using these tests, thermal hazard parameters of cells with different chemistries, sizes and form-factors can be compared directly in a quantifiable and repeatable manner. Data generated from these tests can be used in the design and implementation of fire risk mitigation strategies for battery modules and packs that are used in EVs and PHEVs. This information can also be used in developing and improving computational and analytical models for analyzing thermal runaway and cascading thermal failures in modules and packs."

These advancements support real-time monitoring, remote diagnostics, and personalized treatment, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs .","Research and development for the 5th-generation (5G) wireless systems has been initiated several years ago [1-3]. Such systems, which are set for commercial use sometime around 2020, are expected to provide new types of enhanced user connectivity services, in terms of providing very high data rates, increased capacity, improved security, higher reliability, reduced latency, increased quality of service and availability, and energy efficiency (EE). According to the 5G standard such systems should provide higher data rates, for example, tens of Mb/s and accommodating tens of thousands of users providing data rates of 100 Mb/s for metropolitan areas. Furthermore, their spectral efficiency (SE) will increase significantly, as compared to the SE achieved by the 4th-generation (4G) wireless systems, their coverage will also improve and their latency will be reduced significantly as compared to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2].
[2]: 5G (fifth generation) technology is used to interconnect all terminals, networks, multiple wireless technologies, applications simultaneously which can also switch between them based on VOIP (Voice-over-IP), flat IP, and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), thus user experiences call volume services and high-level data transmission. 5G network is reliable and very fast with minimum delay, higher data rate, greater security, real-time data handling, less error rate, and few data losses. The core technologies used in 5G networks include cloud computing, Heterogeneous Network (Het Net), internet of things (IoT), Cognitive Radio (CR) network, software-defined networking (SDN), Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and massive MIMO. 5G produces different harmful effects such as human health issues, environmental issues, health issues on birds and animals, thermal effects, etc. Regulating agencies have to set a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), its maximum levels for handsets, and every mobile phone must have a SAR rating. 5G technology is used as intelligent technology in which 5G mobile phones can also be used as a tablet PC. This paper presents a general review on 5G along with its comparison with 4G, the general architecture of 5G, a detailed explanation about core technologies of 5G, and also harmful effects on different issues using 5G.
[3]: The considerable characteristics of 5G technology (Fifth Generation of telecommunication) is the very high amount of data that can be transmitted in the time unit (data speed: Megabits per second - throughput) and the very low delay in data exchange (latency). ElectroMagnetic Fields (EMFs) are used for decades for communication reasons and broadcasting. 700 MHz and lower frequencies are currently being used in Digital TV. Low frequencies (800, 900 MHz) are also being used in previous (but still existing) technologies 2G, 3G, 4G, 4G+. 5G will exploit both low and high frequencies. 5G will be operation mainly in a low band (700 MHz) and a high band (3.5 GHz). In the near future mmWave bands will also be used above 6 GHz (for example 24 GHz, 28 GHz and above). Theoretical models and live measurements have consistently shown that the actual maximum power is always less than the 25% of the maximum peak power of a Massive-MIMO antenna. ICNIRP has published in 1998 ""Guidelines for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (100 kHz to 300 GHz)"". The current revision (2020) is based on the same criteria, but it exhibits more accuracy in dosimetry calculations, considering details and based on better biological rationale. mmWave bands (> 6 GHz) is a controversial issue for the population. Reports did not show adverse health effects in daily life under the safety limits. WHO is currently preparing a review about health risks assessment of RF exposure (including mm-Waves), which will be completed by 2022. There is no evidence of adverse health effects at exposure levels below the basic restrictions as described in the ICNIRP (1998) and ICNIRP (2020) guidelines and no evidence of an interaction mechanism that would predict that adverse health effects could occur due to radiofrequency EMF exposure below restriction levels. The new Guidelines provide protection against all adverse health effects, regardless of whether they are due to acute or chronic exposures, regardless of age or health status. Radio and Microwave Frequencies, where mobile technology and Wi-Fi operate, are used in Medicine for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. These bands are used for various application as Microwave Diathermy (same band as 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi technologies), Microwave induced thermoacoustic echography (same band as 4G technology), Medical Imaging / localization of tumors (same bands as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies) and Medical Monitoring / Measurement of vital function as respiration and heart rate (same band as the forthcoming mmWave 5G). By utilizing new technologies that are involved in 5G communication (IoT and mmWave frequencies) healthcare systems can improve the quality of care, provide more personalized and preventive care and reduce the cost of care.
[4]: Due to the development of mobile transmission techniques, more exciting services can be launched that may change our daily lives in more easy and comfortable ways. The introduction of device-to-device (D2D) service in future 5G communication systems can extend the service coverage of intelligent medical treatment from hospitals to anywhere inside the network coverage area, which can save precious time and medical resources. As one of the key techniques in a 5G system, D2D technology has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry due to its system performance improvement, user experience enhancement and service extension. However, the introduction of D2D service will tremendously pollute the system transmission environment due to the induced interference, especially in the downlink direction where the interferer is very strong. This situation brings new challenges for effective and green resource utilization. To solve this problem, a green spectrum resource allocation strategy based on the Hungarian method is proposed in this paper to optimize system spectrum efficiency while considering the fairness among users under the assumption that all resources are fully shared by traditional cellular and newly introduced D2D users. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a system-level Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted, which shows the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm over the traditional greedy algorithm.

Today, there exist several constraints, probably preventing the adoption of such services in clinical routine work. Within a future 5G infrastructure, new possibilities will be available due to improved addressing solutions and extended security services in addition to higher bandwidth in the wireless communication link.

s_1412,"Challenges: Environmental Sensitivity: Bumblebees' responses to environmental changes, such as urbanization, vary by species, which could add complexity to their study .","[3] Bumblebees (i.e. Bombus genus) are major pollinators of flowering wild plants and crops. Although many species are currently in decline, a number of them remain stable or are even expanding. One factor potentially driving changes in bumblebee distribution is the suitability of plant communities. Actually, bees probably have specific nutritional requirements that could shape their floral choices and constraint them in the current context of global change. However, most studies primarily focus on one bumblebee species at a time, making comparative studies scarce. Herein we performed comparative bioassays on three bumblebee species (i.e. Bombus hypnorum, B. pratorum and B. terrestris) fed on three different pollen diets with distinct nutritive content (Cistus, Erica and Salix pollen diets). Micro-colony performance was compared through different developmental and resource collection parameters for understanding the impact of change in pollen diet on different bumblebee species. The evidence suggests that B. terrestris is by far the most competitive species because of its performance compared to the other species, regardless of pollen diet. Our results also highlight a Bombus species effect as pollen diet impacts the micro-colonies in different ways according to the actual bumblebee species. Such interspecific variation in Bombus performance in response to a dietetic change underlines the importance of considering different bumblebee species in mitigation strategies. Such comparative studies are good advice for developing appropriate suites of plant species that can benefit threatened species while supporting stable or expanding ones. [9] For social learning to occur in bumblebees, individuals must first be drawn to the relevant stimuli from which to learn. Here we investigate whether bumblebees (Bombus impatiens) leaving their colony for the first time are drawn to other live bees. In Experiment 1, flower-naïve workers were tested for their preferences of stimuli presented in a radial maze. Live bees, artificial floral patterns and black disks were presented at two different densities (1 vs 6 objects). A marked preference for the six live bees was obtained. Experiment 2 isolated the variable of movement: black disks vs dead bees were presented on a platform that was either stationary or rotating. A preference for moving over stationary displays was obtained, as well as a preference for displays comprising bees rather than disks. Flower-naïve bumblebees leave their nest equipped with behavioural tendencies that can serve to initiate new social encounters from which to learn. [13] To provide strategies to control an unusual pine sawfly outbreak in Oaxaca, the objective of this study was to identify the species and estimate cocoon density and life cycle of the defoliator. For species identification, we followed the taxonomic classification developed by David R. Smith and coworkers, using adult female and male sawflies. Density was evaluated in 10 sites; on each site, one tree was selected at random. From this tree we defined 1 m<sup>2</sup> sampling units at 1 m, 2 m and 3 m from the tree stem. We also proposed a general life cycle based on field data and cocoons kept at laboratory conditions. We identified the presence of Zadiprion howdeni as the invasive sawfly in the region. In Ixtlán, the average density of the cocoons was 37.92 ± 8.63 per m<sup>2</sup>, with significant differences between plots. No significant differences were found in the average density of the cocoons per m<sup>2</sup>, regarding tree distance. However, significant differences in cocoon's numbers were observed between males and females per m<sup>2</sup>. The sawfly´s longest life cycle stage is as a cocoon and the most sensitive stage of life was the adult. Management strategies are provided for the different stages of sawflies. To consolidate these strategies, it is important to continue gathering basic knowledge of the biology and ecology of this defoliating species."
s_1485,Higher concentrations of vitamin D3 (up to 9600 ICU/kg) can enhance body weight and bone mineral content in diets with sub-optimal calcium and phosphorus  .,"An experiment was conducted with broiler starter chicks (1 to 21 d of age) to find out effect of higher concentrations of vitamin D <inf>3</inf> (D <inf>3</inf> 1200, 2400, 4800 and 9600 ICU/kg) to basal diet (BD) containing lower concentrations of calcium (Ca, 0.4%) and non-phytate phosphorus (NPP, 0.2%). A reference diet (RD) containing 1.0% Ca, 0.45% NPP, 1200 1CU D <inf>3</inf>/kg was used for comparison. Each diet was fed to 11 battery brooder pens. Body weight gain, relative weight of tibia, tibia strength, tibia ash content, serum Ca concentration, activities of acid phosphotase (ACP) and alkaline phosphotase (ALP)in serum decreased significantly in broilers fed BD compared to those fed the RD. Supplementation of D <inf>3</inf> to BD non-linearly increased body weight, bone weight and bone ash content, serum Ca concentration and activities of ACP and ALP. Supplementation of D <inf>3</inf> to the BD linearly decreased excretion of all the minerals and Fe. In general, the retention of the trace minerals increased in pancreas and liver with increase in concentrations of D <inf>3</inf> in the BD. The results indicated the possibility of increasing the performance and mineral utilization in broiler starters fed sub-optimal concentrations of Ca and NPP. However, a level of 9600 ICU D <inf>3</inf>/kg in diets containing 0.4% Ca and 0.2% NPP appears to be inadequate to support body weight gain compared to those fed normal concentrations of Ca and NPP."
s_936,"Incorporation of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles: Nano Iron Oxide: Adding nano iron oxide to the propellant formulation can significantly enhance the burning rate, which is directly related to the specific impulse .","The performance of solid propellants is often tailored by incorporating energetic materials such as novel oxidizers, energetic binders and ballistic modifiers.

By involving citizens in data analytics and decision-making processes, these models aim to address ethical concerns and enhance community trust .","Automation through smart city technology deployments and big data analytics has the potential to create more liveable, sustainable, and equitable cities. However, internationally, there are many examples of smart city developments that have attracted criticism, concerns, and community backlash over issues such as data ethics, privacy, mass surveillance, commodification, and social control. In response, this chapter presents DataCare—a model for cities to practically implement technological sovereignty as a way to renew and maintain the social licence to operate smart city technology. Grounded in a critical review of the literature, the chapter argues that data collection and automation in smart cities must be more citizen and community-oriented. Informed by smart city developments in Toronto and Barcelona, the chapter introduces DataCare—a model for a dedicated facility hosted by the city and offered to citizens, communities, and businesses. The envisaged DataCare space can be tailored to raise awareness of data ethics, to run data literacy training seminars, to engage in participatory data analytics, and to speculate about city data futures. DataCare aims to increase data transparency and autonomy, showcase new business opportunities, and empower citizens and community."

Therefore, engine torque and exhaust emissions (CO, CO<inf>2</inf>, NO<inf>x</inf> and hydrocarbons) were tested to determine the effects of altering initial temperature and pressure of CNG prior to entering the combustion chamber of an Otto engine. It was found that variations in initial temperature and pressure do not affect torque. Increased gas temperature leads to decreased contents of CO, HC (hydrocarbons) and NO<inf>x</inf> but increased C02 in exhaust gas. Meanwhile, increase in gas pressure is associated with decreased C02, HC and NO<inf>x</inf> but increased CO in exhaust gas. Based on experimental results, it is clear that fuel gas temperature and pressure do not affect the engine torque but affect the exhaust gas composition."
s_1600,The careful use of herbicides has resulted in improved environmental conditions and the reduction of herbicide-resistant weed species .,"Weeds are among the most important pests of agricultural crops that not only decrease the crop yields but also severely damage the quality of produce. Herbicides are usually effective in suppressing weeds occasionally supplemented with other weed control methods. During recent times, a number of factors have increased the importance of non-chemical weed control methods. Some of these are environmental concerns arising by overuse of pesticides, rising demands for organic food, and an evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds. This chapter discusses «why non-chemical weed control is needed?» and also provides an overview of currently available non-chemical weed control techniques.
[3]: Weed management in agriculture is hampered by inefficient intensive methods, such as monoculture, deep plowing, and herbicides, leading to health and environmental problems. Furthermore, the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weed ecotypes in the Mediterranean, particularly in France (with over 61 ecotypes), Spain (41), and Italy (37), is a major concern, with a significant proportion of herbicides in the region. In this study, we examined the benefits of adopting agroecology as a sustainable approach for weed management in the Mediterranean region. Agroecology offers a variety of techniques and practices to improve sustainability and weed management, while preserving ecological balance and biodiversity. However, solving these challenges is multifactorial and depends on local specificities, predominant weed species, crops, sowing dates, and pedo-climatic factors. In addition, this study included a systematic analysis of agroecological weed management in Mediterranean countries, assessing the effectiveness of existing practices, and identifying areas requiring further exploration in agroecosystems. A bibliometric analysis was also included to assess the literature on agroecology and weed management quantitatively, identifying major trends, influential studies, and research gaps. The bibliometric analysis highlighted the importance of alternative herbicides in Mediterranean ""weed"" (with a link strength of 44), ""agroecology"" (22), and ""biodiversity"" (16). Italy has the strongest collaboration network, with a link strength of 61, followed by Turkey (44), and France (42). Using specific keywords to agroecological practices for weed management in Scopus, France worked the most in this context (around 25% of studies), followed by Spain (17%) and Italy (17%), while all other countries contributed to less than 40% of studies carried out in the Mediterranean context. Clearly, it is imperative to foster collaboration between Mediterranean countries to develop effective and sustainable weed control strategies. Understanding the challenges of herbicide-resistant weeds, exploring their reasons and mechanisms, and using systematic studies and bibliometric analyses will help to develop effective strategies for managing weeds in the Mediterranean. Agroecological management favors effective control, while promoting healthy and sustainable ecosystems, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring long-term food security.
[4]: Adoption of conservation agriculture has brought significant changes in crop management in Australia. Increased reliance on herbicidal weed control is one of the most significant changes that have occurred throughout Australian cropping systems. The singular focus on herbicides for weed management has led to the frequent and widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in several weed species. Herbicide resistance means the loss of herbicide resources and as new herbicides modes of action are unlikely then use of alternative non-chemical cultural weed management options is essential. Crop competition is an approach that can be used to manage weeds for improved crop production. Enhanced crop competition can be achieved through the use of competitive crop species and cultivars, increased seed rates, narrow row spacing, and altered row orientation. These options are already routinely used in Australia and are proven in their ability to reduce weed biomass and fecundity. Although these strategies have been successfully used in Australian cropping systems, the research has frequently been focussed locally and not extrapolated more broadly throughout the Australian grain production region. Crop competition can potentially be a sustainable weed management option in reducing the reliance on herbicides and combating herbicide resistance and therefore, needs to be considered in all integrated weed management plans."
s_1295,"Oral Hypoglycemic Agents: Do not include sulfonylureas, biguanides, and thiazolidinediones, as they are ineffective in managing blood glucose levels .","Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder resulting from a defect in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. Insulin deficiency in turn leads to chronic hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism. It is the most common endocrine disorder and by the year 2010, it is estimated that more than 200 million people worldwide will have DM and 300 million will subsequently have the disease by 2025. As the disease progresses tissue or vascular damage ensues leading to severe diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular complications and ulceration. Thus, diabetes covers a wide range of heterogeneous diseases. Diabetes mellitus may be categorized into several types but the two major types are type 1 and type 2. Drugs are used primarily to save life and alleviate symptoms. Secondary aims are to prevent long-term diabetic complications and, by eliminating various risk factors, to increase longevity. Insulin replacement therapy is the mainstay for patients with type 1 DM while diet and lifestyle modifications are considered the cornerstone for the treatment and management of type 2 DM. Insulin is also important in type 2 DM when blood glucose levels cannot be controlled by diet, weight loss, exercise and oral medications. Oral hypoglycaemic agents are also useful in the treatment of type 2 DM. Oral hypoglycaemic agents include sulphonylureas, biguanides, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, meglitinide analogues, and thiazolidenediones. The main objective of these drugs is to correct the underlying metabolic disorder, such as insulin resistance and inadequate insulin secretion. They should be prescribed in combination with an appropriate diet and lifestyle changes. Diet and lifestyle strategies are to reduce weight, improve glycaemic control and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications, which account for 70% to 80% of deaths among those with diabetes. Diabetes is best controlled either by diet alone and exercise (non-pharmacological), or diet with herbal or oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin (pharmacological). The main side effects are weight gain and hypoglycaemia with sulfonylureas, gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances with metformin, weight gain, GI disturbances and liver injury with thiazolidinediones, GI disturbances, weight gain and hypersensitivity reactions with meglitinides and flatulence, diarrhoea and abdominal bloating with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors."
s_293,Challenges and Solutions: Scalability: Techniques like parallelism and distributed search do not effectively manage the exponential growth of the search space in complex problems .,"Model checking is a fully automated, formal method for demonstrating absence of bugs in reactive systems. Here, bugs are violations of properties in Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL). A fundamental challenge to its application is the exponential explosion in the number of system states. The current chapter discusses the use of parallelism in order to overcome this challenge. We reiterate the textbook automata-theoretic approach, which reduces the model checking problem to the graph problem of finding cycles. We discuss several parallel algorithms that attack this problem in various ways, each with different characteristics: Depth-first search (DFS) based algorithms rely on heuristics for good parallelization, but exhibit a low complexity and good on-the-fly behavior. Breadth-first search (BFS) based approaches, on the other hand, offer good parallel scalability and support distributed parallelism. In addition, we present various simpler model checking tasks, which still solve a large and important subset of the LTL model checking problem, and show how these can be exploited to yield more efficient algorithms. In particular, we provide simplified DFS-based search algorithms and show that the BFS-based algorithms exhibit optimal runtimes in certain cases."

i_791,Key Factors Impacting Digital Transformation: Skills and Knowledge: The successful implementation of digital technologies such as Virtual Reality (VR) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) is heavily reliant on the presence of specific skills and knowledge within the organization. Training and development are crucial to harness the full potential of these technologies .,"Despite increasing adoption of digital technology in construction, productivity reports have remained disappointing. To develop insights into the reasons of this contradiction, the present paper suggests drawing on organisational competitiveness literature considering that the factors-Affecting-productivity are conveniently captured within that literature. Through a questionnaire survey, the paper analyses the views of managers in the UK construction industry regarding the effect of Building Information Modelling (BIM) and Big Data Analytics (BDA) on organisational competitiveness. The results are then traced back to the factors-Affecting-productivity for discussion. It is concluded that digitalisation enables performance improvements that can be tied to productivity gains, but this relies on the presence of certain skills and knowledge, which require training. It is also concluded that the lack of impact of digitalisation on some of the factors-Affecting-productivity may be limiting the impact of digitalisation on the overall productivity, thus leading to a stagnating productivity."

For instance, fermented dairy-cereal composites showed improved protein digestibility and amino acid profiles .","BACKGROUND: Dairy and cereal products are frequently combined to create composites with enhanced nutritional benefits. Commercially available dried dairy-cereal composites are typically reconstituted and cooked to produce porridge or soup. RESULTS: Dried fermented milk-cereal composites (FMCC) with ∼193 g kg <sup>−1</sup> protein were prepared by blending fermented milk with parboiled oats (FMCCo), wheat (FMCCw), or barley (FMCCb), incubating the blend, drying, and milling. Cereal type significantly affected the composition of the FMCC and the properties of the reconstituted, cooked FMCC (R-FMCC). The FMCCo had a higher starch and fat content and lower levels of lactose, lactic acid, and amylose than FMCCb. The R-FMCCo had higher viscosity during cooking at 95 °C and cooling to 35 °C, and higher values of yield stress (σ <inf>0</inf> ), consistency index (K) and viscosity on shearing from 20 to 120 s <sup>−1</sup> at 60 °C than R-FMCCb. The FMCCw had lower levels of fat and β-glucan than FMCCo or FMCCb, but was otherwise closer to FMMCb with respect to composition, cooking properties and flow behavior. CONCLUSION: Differences in composition and consistency associated with cereal type are likely to affect the nutritional value of the FMCC. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry."

However, the visual comfort of three-dimensional image has gradually become an important factor related to the visual safety and physiological health of viewers. Aiming at the color difference of left and right eye views in VR/AR stereoscopic video, quantitative experiments through subjective assessment were conducted to study the influence of Hue, Saturation and Brightness (HSB) on visual comfort in binocular stereoscopic video, and VR/AR comfort relationship models based on HSB was established. The universality of the models was further verified through experiments, and the results showed that the matching accuracy rate between the subjective evaluation results and the VR/AR comfort relationship models reached more than 80%, that is, the model had a high consistency with the subjective evaluation results, which will provide a reference for the evaluation of VR/AR stereo video visual comfort."

The aim of the present study is to analyse the role that women directors can play as driving forces behind the development of CSR in organisations, and contribute to sustainable development. Despite the fact that gender diversity is acquiring considerable importance, most research has focused on analysing how it affects financial performance. In this study, we analyse the implications that gender diversity has on CSR. To do so, we have carried out an empirical study of a sample of firms from a variety of countries and sectors to determine whether those firms with a higher percentage of women on the board of directors are more socially responsible. The results support the hypothesis that gender diversity has a positive influence on CSR. Female talent can play a strategic role in enabling firms to manage their social responsibility and sustainable practices appropriately."
s_1516,"Lignocellulosic Biomass: This includes agricultural and wood residues, which are abundant and cost-effective. These substrates are rich in cellulose and hemicellulose, which fungi can break down into simpler sugars for growth and mycoprotein production .","Fungi, being natural decomposers, are the most potent, ubiquitous and versatile sources of industrial enzymes. About 60% of market share of industrial enzymes is sourced from filamentous fungi and yeasts. Mycozymes (myco-fungus; zymes-enzymes) are playing a pivotal role in several industrial applications and a number of potential applications are in the offing. The field of mycozyme production, while maintaining the old traditional methods, has also witnessed a sea change due to advents in recombinant DNA technology, optimisation protocols, fermentation technology and systems biology. Consolidated bioprocessing of abundant lignocellulosic biomass and complex polysaccharides is being explored at an unprecedented pace and a number of mycozymes of diverse fungal origins are being explored using suitable platforms. The present review attempts to revisit the current status of various mycozymes, screening and production strategies and applications thereof.
[2]: Trichoderma sp. is a potential cellulase producing mesophilic fungi which grow under mild acidic condition. In this study, growth and nutritional conditions were manipulated for the maximum and cost-effective production of cellulase using lab strain Trichoderma sp. RCK65 and checked for its efficiency in hydrolysis of Prosopis juliflora (a woody substrate). Preliminary studies suggested that when 48 h old secondary fungal culture (20 % v/w) was inoculated in wheat bran moistened with mineral salt solution (pH 4.5 and 1:3 solid to moisture ratio), incubated at 30 °C and after 72 h, it produced maximum cellulase (CMCase 145 U/gds, FPase 38 U/gds and β-glucosidase 105 U/gds). However, using statistical approach a S:L ratio (1:1) was surprisingly found to be optimum that improved cellulase that is CMCase activity by 6.21 %, FPase activity by 23.68 % and β-glucosidase activity by 37.28 %. The estimated cost of crude enzyme (Rs. 5.311/1000 FPase units) seems to be economically feasible which may be due to high enzyme titre, less cultivation time and low media cost. Moreover, when the crude enzyme was used to saccharify pretreated Prosopis juliflora (a woody substrate), it resulted up to 83 % (w/w) saccharification.
[3]: Background: Cellulosic biomass especially agricultural/wood residues can be utilized as feedstock to cost-effectively produce fuels, chemicals and bulk industrial enzymes, which demands xylose utilization from microbial cell factories. While previous works have made significant progress in improving microbial conversion of xylose into fuels and chemicals, no study has reported the engineering of efficient xylose utilizing protein expression systems for the purpose of producing industrial enzymes. Results: In this work, using Pichia pastoris as an example, we demonstrated the successful engineering of xylose metabolizing ability into of protein expression systems. A heterologous XI (xylose isomerase) pathway was introduced into P. pastoris GS115 by overexpressing the Orpinomyces spp. XI or/and the endogenous XK (xylulokinase) gene, and evolutionary engineering strategies were also applied. Results showed that the XI pathway could be functionally expressed in P. pastoris. After 50 generation of sequential batch cultivation, a set of domesticated recombinant P. pastoris strains with different performance metrics on xylose were obtained. One evolved strain showed the highest xylose assimilation ability, whose cell yield on xylose can even be comparable to that on glucose or glycerol. This strain also showed significantly increased β-mannanase production when cultured on xylose medium. Furthermore, transcription analysis of xylose pathway genes suggested that overexpression of XI and XK might be the key factors affecting effective xylose assimilation. Conclusions: To our best knowledge, this study is the first work demonstrating the construction of efficient xylose utilizing P. pastoris strains, thus providing a basis for using cellulosic biomass for bulk industrial enzyme production."
i_797,"Key Factors Impacting Digital Transformation: Standardization and Information Management: The absence of standardized information structures for construction equipment and elements is likely the sole reason hindering the digital transformation process. Therefore, developing relational databases and BIM libraries to standardize and manage information is the only effective way to improve construction planning and management .","In the last years, the digital evolution involved the construction sector and produced radical changes in projects elaboration and realization. The diffusion of digital models implies a particular attention on information related to the building elements. For what concerns construction planning and management, this information need to be related to the information of the elements proper of a construction site such as equipment and machines. A deep research focused on the manufacturers' sheets showed how technical information related to construction equipment are often non-homogenous and incomplete, probably because of a lack of a precise standard. The aims of this research are then the definition of a proper standard information structure for construction equipment and its digitalization thanks to the use of relational Databases and Building Information Models. To do this the amount of information collected from a wide number of datasheets have been standardized and organized in homogenous informative sets to be related in order to gain the correct information package of an equipment. The realization of a relational database permitted to store such data in a digital format and to search them in an efficient way. The realization of a BIM library permitted to provide to designers and firms a tool able to improve and automatize design choices in terms of construction issues."

They address complex data processing and customer privacy issues, making them indispensable for modern marketing needs .","This chapter reviews recent research deploying deep learning (DL) to resolve problems in interactive marketing. It takes stock of what marketers know, how and why they do that. From an engagement marketing perspective, this chapter catalogues DL application cases in (1) customer acquisition, expansion, and retention, (2) marketing communication, and (3) product innovation. By identifying challenges from technological advancement and interactive marketing needs, it characterizes eleven issues that marketers have to deal with. They include the curse of dimensionality, complex data processing, language-image nexus, and customer privacy. This chapter elucidates the DL logic and solution techniques to correspondingly address these issues. It also introduces some technical terms for communication with data scientists. They include generative adversarial networks, transfer learning, and federated learning. A wide range of typical DL models is presented, from simple classification to sophisticated language models. Marketers have to choose from them according to their application matters. This chapter concludes that DL is indispensable to fulfilling today's customer needs for performance and interactivity. The review shall help formulate DL projects and it can act as a handy reference for exotic marketing innovations upon new technology trends, like the Metaverse. Implications and challenges will be discussed in the ending section. Hopefully, marketers will find DL easier, for implementation or outsourcing."
s_648,Data Collection Strategies: Content Analysis: Analyzing existing literature and extracting relevant risk factors can help in building a comprehensive understanding of the risk landscape .,"[11] Public-private partnerships (PPPs) are used for infrastructure projects, but they usually involve risk because of their complexity. The construction and operation stages are the core of successful infrastructure PPP projects. This study analysed the efficiency and determinants of the construction and operation stages of Chinese infrastructure PPP projects conducted by thirty provinces from 2008–2013. During the five years examined, the efficiency of infrastructure PPP projects in the construction stage exhibited a downward spiral, but showed a gradual upward trend in the operation stage. The results showed that government supervision was one of the most significant positive influences on construction efficiency, while risk allocation had a greater positive impact on efficiency during the operation stage. The evidence in this study is impactful because it provides insights for practitioners regarding key determinants for improving efficiency in the construction and operation stages of infrastructure PPP projects."
s_1999,Inference on Majority Material Recycling: Separation and Sorting: Proper labeling and identification of materials are essential for sorting and recycling. This implies that the dominant material in a mixed-material package would likely dictate the primary recycling method used .,"Packages have high rotation as they become municipal solid waste just after the consumption of the product. Therefore, packages should be labeled with identification of the material they are made of in order to help the recycling chain. Many products made from plastics show a resin identification code - usually from 1 to 7 inside a three-arrow triangle above a monogram - aimed at identifying the type of plastic the product is made of, and help its separation and later recycling. In other words, one aims to facilitate recovery of plastics discarded with the municipal solid waste. In this study we collected data on the resin identification code in flexible plastic packages to assess whether the guidelines for material identification are being followed. The data collection was performed in a total of 509 flexible plastic packages used for packing food and non-food products available in the Brazilian market. Even though the NBR 13230 Brazilian standard is already in its second revision, the resin identification code in plastic packages is still used in a very heterogeneous fashion. Approximately 50% of the packages had the resin identification code. Up to 30% of some packages showed incorrect material identification code. Therefore, misinformation still occurs in the Brazilian market concerning the type of material for plastic packaging - including lack of the resin identification code and incorrect form of identification code in the plastic packaging. Both of these problems have negative effects on the plastic recycling chain. We propose that other materials used in flexible plastic packages, e.g. aluminum foil, should also be identified, in order to make the separation and recycling easier."
s_2217,"Key Considerations for Mitigation: Noise Mitigation Strategies: While developing and implementing noise reduction methods during construction may help mitigate some impact on marine life, it is likely that these methods will be insufficient to address the considerable underwater noise emissions generated by offshore wind farms .","Offshore wind energy is a new technology created by the merging of classical wind energy technology and classical offshore technology. Wind speeds are considerably higher over the sea as compared to onshore sites, but also the cost per installed kW will increase when moving offshore. The rapid development of wind energy use in Germany is accompanied by an increase of the installed power per wind turbine. In the German areas of the North and Baltic Seas, several large offshore wind farms are planned; each with several hundreds turbines of up to 5 MW each. The Institute for Structural Analysis (ISD) of the University of Hannover, the German Wind Energy Institute (DEWI) in Wilhelmshaven, and the Institute for Technical and Applied Physics (itap) in Oldenburg are partners in a project on: Standard Procedures for the Determination and Assessment of Noise Impact on Sea Life by Offshore Wind Farms which is funded by the German Federal Ministry for Environment (BMU). The aim of this project (CRI, DEWI, itap 2004) is to study the generation, radiation and attenuation of underwater noise, to develop forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters and future noise reduction methods during pile driving, to determine the impact area of offshore wind farms, to allow the formulation of recommendations for acoustic emission thresholds for offshore wind farms in cooperation with biologists, and to develop standard procedures for the determination and assessment of noise emissions. The operation and in particular the construction of offshore wind converters induce considerable underwater noise emissions. It is assumed that small whales and seals can be affected by noises from machines and vessels, piling and installation of the wind turbines. Piling, in particular using hydraulic hammers creates high frequency noise with considerable sound power levels. Currently, only little knowledge about the effects of different noises to marine life is available. With a view to determining the effects on the marine flora and fauna and structural design aspects, the research platform FINO 1 (Fig. 1) was erected in the North Sea. Measurements of the underwater noise during construction of offshore research platforms and numerical investigations are used to develop future forecasting hydro sound models of offshore wind converters. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

i_2071,"Stomatal opening and closing are controlled by environmental factors such as light, humidity, and soil water status .","Stomata rapidly and slowly respond to a range of abiotic stress, regulating water status. Under water-sufficient conditions, the majority of water loss in plants occurs through open stomata. Under environmental conditions that cause stomata to close, such as during drought, water loss is mainly executed via solid-phase cuticular transpiration. The diffusional resistance of the transpiration pathway consists of two varying components: the leaf stomatal resistance and the leaf boundary layer resistance. Dehydration avoidance mechanisms involve the maintenance of a high (favorable) plant water status during stress. Many cacti, orchids, bromeliads, and other succulent plants with crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) have stomatal activity patterns that contrast with those found in C3 and C4 plants. Tolerance to low water potentials requires maintaining plant functions under limited water availability and/or the rapid recovery of plant water status and plant function after stress.
[10]: Stomata control tree transpiration by sensing and integrating environmental signals originating in the atmosphere and soil, and co-occurring species may differ in inherent stomatal sensitivity to these above-and belowground signals and in the types of signals to which they respond. Stomatal responsiveness to environmental signals is likely to differ across species having different types of wood (e.g., ring-porous, diffuse-porous and coniferous) because each wood type differs in the structure, size and spatial distribution of its xylem conduits as well as in the scaling of hydraulic properties with stem diameter. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of variation in soil water availability and atmospheric evaporative demand on stomatal regulation of transpiration in seven co-occurring temperate deciduous forest species representing three wood types. We measured whole-tree sap flux and soil and atmospheric variables in a mixed deciduous forest in central Pennsylvania over the course of a growing season characterized by severe drought and large fluctuations in atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (D). The relative sensitivity of sap flux to soil drying was ∼2.2-2.3 times greater in the diffuse-porous and coniferous species than in the ring-porous species. Stomata of the ring-porous oaks were only about half as responsive to increased D as those of trees of the other two wood types. These differences in responsiveness to changes in the below-and aboveground environment implied that regulation of leaf water potential in the ring-porous oaks was less stringent than that in the diffuse-porous angiosperms or the conifers. The results suggest that increases in the frequency or intensity of summer droughts in the study region could have multiple consequences for forest function, including altered successional time courses or climax species composition and cumulative effects on whole-tree architecture, resulting in a structural and physiological legacy that would restrict the ability of trees to respond rapidly to more favorable growth conditions. © 2013 The Author."

Plant-based proteins have a more consistent nutrient profile than animal sources but may contain antinutritional factors, including trypsin inhibitors and oligosaccharides. Bioprocessed soy protein (SP; HP-300; Hamlet Protein, Inc., Findlay, OH) is a processed soy-based product with low antinutritional factor concentrations and high protein quality. The objective was to evaluate the effects of SP on apparent total tract macronutrient digestibility, fecal characteristics, and fecal fermentative end products. Furthermore, this study aimed to identify if SP can be a replacement for poultry byproduct meal (PBPM) in dog food and determine if there are practical limits to its use. Three palatability experiments were conducted to evaluate 1) 0 vs. 12% SP, 2) 0 vs. 48% SP, and 3) 12 vs. 48% SP. For digestibility, 48 healthy adult Beagle dogs (20 females and 28 males; 3.4 yr mean age and 10.0 kg mean BW) were randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments, 0 (control), 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48% SP, in a completely randomized design. All diets were formulated to meet Association of American Feed Control Officials nutrient profiles and contained approximately 30% CP and 16% fat. The treatment period consisted of a 10-d diet adaptation phase followed by a 4-d fresh and total fecal collection phase. The palatability results suggest that of the 3 inclusion levels tested (0, 12, or 48% SP), the best inclusion of SP is 12%, which was preferred over 0 and 48% SP. Digestibility and fecal data were evaluated for linear and quadratic effects using SAS. Stool output (on both an as-is and a DM basis) did not differ from the control except for the 48% SP treatment (P < 0.01). Fecal output per unit food intake differed (P < 0.01) from the control only at the 24 and 48% SP inclusion rates. No significant effects of feeding SP were found on stool consistency scores. Digestibility of DM, OM, and energy did not differ from the control at any inclusion rate, except for a decrease (P < 0.01) at 48% SP. Apparent total tract CP digestibility was not affected by treatment and ranged from 82.9 to 86.2%. Fecal short-chain fatty acid concentrations were greater (P < 0.01) in dogs fed 24 and 48% SP compared with the control. Conversely, branched-chain fatty acid concentrations were lower (P < 0.01) in dogs fed 8 to 48% SP compared with the control. These data suggest that SP is a suitable replacement for PBPM in dog diets up to a 24% inclusion level."

Continuous Improvement: Feedback Mechanisms: Establish mechanisms for feedback from users and curators to continuously improve the validation processes and address any emerging issues .,"Culture collections contain indispensable information about the microorganisms preserved in their repositories, such as taxonomical descriptions, origins, physiological and biochemical characteristics, bibliographic references, etc. However, information currently accessible in databases rarely adheres to common standard protocols. The resultant heterogeneity between culture collections, in terms of both content and format, notably hampers microorganism-based research and development (R&D). The optimized exploitation of these resources thus requires standardized, and simplified, access to the associated information. To this end, and in the interest of supporting R&D in the fields of agriculture, health and biotechnology, a pan-European distributed research infrastructure, MIRRI, including over 40 public culture collections and research institutes from 19 European countries, was established. A prime objective of MIRRI is to unite and provide universal access to the fragmented, and untapped, resources, information and expertise available in European public collections of microorganisms; a key component of which is to develop a dynamic Information System. For the first time, both culture collection curators as well as their users have been consulted and their feedback, concerning the needs and requirements for collection databases and data accessibility, utilised. Users primarily noted that databases were not interoperable, thus rendering a global search of multiple databases impossible. Unreliable or out-of-date and, in particular, non-homogenous, taxonomic information was also considered to be a major obstacle to searching microbial data efficiently. Moreover, complex searches are rarely possible in online databases thus limiting the extent of search queries. Curators also consider that overall harmonization—including Standard Operating Procedures, data structure, and software tools—is necessary to facilitate their work and to make high-quality data easily accessible to their users. Clearly, the needs of culture collection curators coincide with those of users on the crucial point of database interoperability. In this regard, and in order to design an appropriate Information System, important aspects on which the culture collection community should focus include: the interoperability of data sets with the ontologies to be used; setting best practice in data management, and the definition of an appropriate data standard."
i_662,"Intelligent and Adaptive Control: Nonlinear Control Strategies: For remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), nonlinear control strategies that account for coupled and nonlinear dynamics are being developed to improve control accuracy and reliability .","Modern developments in the fields of control, sensing, and communication have made increasingly complex and dedicated underwater robot systems a reality. Used in a highly hazardous and unknown environment, the autonomy and dynamics of the robots is the key to mission success. Though the dynamics of underwater vehicle system is highly coupled and non linear in nature, decoupled control system strategy is widely used for practical applications. As autonomous underwater vehicles need intelligent control systems, it is necessary to develop control systems that really take into account the coupled and non-linear characteristics of the system. In this paper, we propose a control system with a nonlinear control strategy that takes into account the above factors. So far, AUV dynamics has often been derived under various assumptions on the motion of the vehicle. However, such assumptions may induce large modelling errors and may cause severe control problems in many practical applications. We propose to use both Lyapunov and state space back stepping based non linear control to overcome the modelling errors. The strategy will be tested through simulations for a flat-fish type AUV. Basic controller design and the simulation results will be discussed in the paper. A comparison of the results for conventional method and the proposed method will also be presented. © 2008 IEEE."
i_1753,"Concept and Purpose: Biodiversity credits are financial instruments designed to incentivize the conservation of biodiversity by assigning a monetary value to the preservation and restoration of ecosystems. These credits can be bought and sold in markets, similar to carbon credits, to offset environmental impacts elsewhere .","This article discusses financial mechanisms for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services in Brazil. Five mechanisms were selected for in-depth analysis using the Biofin methodological approach: ecological fiscal transfer, environmental reserve quotas, payments for environmental services, tourism concessions, and forest concessions. They can reduce the current financial gap for biodiversity conservation in the country. Ecological fiscal transfer, payments for environmental services, tourism, and forest concessions can generate approximately US$ 1 billion annually. The potential to generate revenues in environmental reserve quotas markets is big, but uncertainty is also very high, with estimates from US$ 1 to US$ 20 billion up to 2030. Most of these mechanisms aim to involve the private sector in conserving biodiversity and require an active role for the public sector, either through fiscal or regulatory instruments. There is a need to adapt the financial mechanism to the political and institutional context. In Brazil, weak public management capacity, institutional uncertainties, and political opposition to environmental policy are the main challenges for large-scale implementation of these instruments.
[2]: Environmental credit markets have been established to offset impacts to wetlands, endangered species habitat, water quality, and the global climate system. As these markets mature, participants are exploring the concept of credit stacking, whereby a conservation project or parcel produces different types of mitigation credits for multiple markets (such as wetland and endangered species credits or water quality and carbon sequestration credits). If these stacked credits are unbundled, they may be sold in different credit markets to offset impacts from different activities. Such transactions raise concerns about additionally, interagency coordination, verification of ecological improvements, monitoring and management, and transparency. This Article examines eight different credit stacking scenarios and the emerging rules that govern the sale of credits. Generally, there is diversity in how different federal and state agencies handle credit stacking, and they have not issued clear rules on when unbundling stacked credits is permissible. The Article closes with considerations that agencies could take into account in developing a credit stacking protocol to avoid double counting and ecological loss. The credit stacking scenario where it may be most appropriate to consider unbundling is when the accounting units are pollutant-specific, such as is the case with water quality and carbon markets. © 2013 Regents of the University of California."
i_897,"Key Points: Vibration Control: Essential for reducing vibrations in rotating machinery, enhancing reliability and lifespan .","Rotordynamics is a very challenging field because of machine complexities. Many internal and external factors contribute toward change in the structural dynamic characteristics. One of these factors is broad-band high-vibration amplitudes. In this article, a similar high vibration issue on a gas turbine is investigated using bode, orbit, and shaft centerline plots. Data from proximity probes installed on turbine generator system are captured and analyzed against any factor contributing toward high vibration issue. Fish bone diagram was used for root cause investigation. Main components investigated for the root cause of high vibration issue include generator rotor and casing. Rotor behavior has been examined by capturing orbit and shaft centerline diagrams, whereas casing contribution has been investigated by conducting operating deflection shape analysis. A comparison is drawn between a machine suffering from high vibration issue and a normal machine. Resonance was identified as the root cause, and stiffness enhancement was recommended to change the natural frequency of casing. Based on investigations, recommendations are given and a final comparison is drawn after structural modification was done. In addition to early fault finding, reduction in maximum vibration was 38% after implementation of the fix that confirmed the accuracy of the root cause investigation process.
[2]: A key component in panel board production is the fibre refiner, whose task is to break cellulose wood chips into slender fibres. This refining process takes place between a rotor and a stator, where a gap of around 0.5 mm is found. In the development of these refiners predicting the dynamics is important; hence, mathematical models are needed. For refiners and other applications like brakes, turbines, and compressors, the interaction between the rotor and the surrounding medium can in many situations be significant. In addition to external load, this interaction can also change the characteristics of the system, which should be considered in the design process. Today, there exists no validated load model for fibre refiner process. Hence, the aim of this paper is to suggest one. Measured axial force data were divided into a constant part and a superimposed oscillating part with different frequencies. For both parts a linear dependence on the gap between the stator and the rotor was assumed. Finally, a four degrees of freedom (dof) model was used to fit a pressure distribution to the axial force model. This process load model led to stiffness and external loads that can be both time dependant. If the pressure distribution only shows a radial variation along the refining zone, all the external loads except the axial one will vanish. The number of functions describing the stiffness parameters also decrease from eight to four. In one case, four stiffness coefficients vanish, whereas the remaining coefficients become constant. This occurs if the process load does not follow the angular vibrations and there is no gap dependence on the oscillating parts of the process load. Numerical simulations showed that by applying a specific process load model, the vibration orbit changed from the unbalance response by means of shape and vibration origin. The unstable domain was further increased when the process load model was applied. Measurements are necessary to select a realistic process model for a specific application. The derived model can be used in product development to choose suitable system parameters and thus to avoid dynamical problems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[3]: In an active magnetic bearing (AMB) system, the catcher bearings (CBs) are indispensable to protect the rotor and stator in case the magnetic bearings fail. Most of the former researches associated with CBs are mainly focused on the dynamic responses of the rotor drops onto traditional single-decker catcher bearings (SDCBs). But because of the lower limited speed of SDCB, it cannot withstand the ultra high speed rotation after rotor drop. In this paper, based on the analysis of the disadvantages of SDCBs, a new type of double-decker catcher bearings (DDCBs) is proposed to enhance the CB work performance in AMB system. In order to obtain the accurate rotor movements before AMB failure, the dynamic characteristics of AMB are theoretically derived. Detailed simulation models containing rigid rotor model, contact model between rotor and inner race, DDCB force model as well as heating model after rotor drop are established. Then, using those established models the dynamic responses of rotor drops onto DDCBs and SDCBs are respectively simulated. The rotor orbits, contact forces, spin speeds of various parts and heat energies after AMB failure are mainly analyzed. The simulation results show that DDCBs can effectively improve the CBs limit rotational speed and reduce the following vibrations, impacts and heating. Finally, rotor drop experiments choosing different types of CBs are carried out on the established AMB test bench. Rotor orbits, inner race temperatures as well as the rotating speeds of both inner race and intermediate races after rotor drop are synchronously measured. The experiment results verify the advantages of DDCB and the correctness of theoretical analysis. The studies provide certain theoretical and experimental references for the application of DDCBs in AMB system. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013."

Addressing Climate Change: Climate Resilience: Developing and implementing strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on agriculture, such as adopting climate-resilient crop varieties and improving water management, is essential .","Climate change has an impact on the environment, especially in agriculture. Climate change which caused the emergence of extreme weather led to declining agricultural productivity or crop failures in several regions. Some areas of Gunungkidul are the most difficult areas to plant rice compared to other regencies/cities in the Special Region of Yogyakarta. The issue of agricultural land conversion is a problem for almost all countries in the world that are difficult to resolve as development increases. Different policies are implemented to minimize the adverse effects of the conversion of agricultural land in various regions of the world. One of the policies that applied in Indonesia is the policy of Sustainable Food Agriculture Land Protection or Perlindungan Lahan Pertanian Pangan Berkelanjutan (PLP2B policy). Until now, this policy was slowing the movement in Indonesia, including in Gunungkidul. This article aims to analyze the performance and dilemma of this policy in Gunungkidul. Qualitative research with case study approach had been done and data was collected through documentation or literature study, observation, in-depth interviews and Forum Group Discussion. The results showed that PLP2B policy has not been optimally implemented and still become a dilemma to local government rather than become a solution."
s_1700,"Chromatographic Techniques: High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC): Description: HPLC is a commonly used method for determining sugar concentrations, but it is often considered the only reliable technique despite its extensive sample preparation and solvent extraction, which makes it time-consuming and expensive .","The determination and quantification of sugars is important for quality control and assurance of horticultural produce. This review discusses analytical methods for determination of sugars and sweetness of fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, including the use of destructive and non-destructive instrumental techniques to evaluate sugar composition and characterize taste profile or sweetness. From the standard hand-held refractometer to the hydrometer, electronic tongue and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with different detectors, a wide range of devices have been used to determine sugar composition and sweetness of many fruit and vegetable products. Although chromatographic techniques are very accurate and useful, they require extensive sample preparation based on solvent extraction and hence are generally time-consuming and expensive. Visible to near infrared spectroscopy (vis/NIRS) has been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional methods due to its rapidity, simplicity, cost effectiveness and potential for routine analysis if proper calibration and validation steps were developed. Current trends favour analytical methods that are simple to use, quick and non-destructive. The prospects for using emerging technologies such as hyperspectral imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance for non-destructive assessment of sugar content and sweetness of fresh and processed horticultural food products are also discussed.
[2]: Accurate quantification of tuber glucose and sucrose content is important for scientific as well as commercial purposes. High pressure liquid chromatography and enzyme coupled assays are accepted methods for determining sugar concentrations. A method is presented here for a reliable, cost-effective, 96-well microplate enzymatic assay that allows one to determine quickly sugar concentrations in tuber samples and in other vegetables. Sample size can be less than 1 g of fresh material. This colorometric assay utilizes coupled reactions of glucose oxidase and peroxidase to accurately measure glucose concentrations. Sucrose content is determined by using invertase in an additional enzyme mediated step. Data from this improved enzymatic assay compare favorably with other methods, with the added benefits of lower capital outlay and fast sample turn around times. © 2008 Potato Association of America."

Enhanced Antimicrobial Properties Graphene-Based Nanomaterials: Graphene oxide nanoparticles (GONPs) have shown exceptional antimicrobial properties, which can be beneficial in preventing infections post-EVLA. These nanoparticles can be integrated into the laser fibers or the tumescent anesthesia solution to provide an additional layer of protection against microbial infections .","Graphene-based materials have been the subject of extensive research due to its exceptional ability to kill a diverse array of microorganisms. The benefits of graphene-based materials include ease of fabrication, renewable resources, special catalytic properties, and remarkable physical properties including tensile strength and a large specific surface area. Our study utilizes an environmental method (laser production) to produce GONPs. GONPs are tested as potential; this study assesses the molecular docking simulation, anti-microbial, against clinically pathogenic strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus. Antioxidant by DPPH assay and anti-cancer properties of graphene nanoparticles (GONPs) with Doxorubicin on lung cancer (A549 cell line). TEM images demonstrated types of produced GO-NP spherical nanoparticles with a size ranging at approximately 15–40 nm. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to examine the morphological and topological characteristics of the NPs. The structural and crystal characteristics were examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Among the anti-bacterial-evaluated GONPs, concentrations of 100, 50, and 25 µg/ml exhibited the most substantial growth inhibition zone against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Bacillus cereus. The molecular docking simulation of GONP-OH modified gave more effective results against Bacillus cereus bacterial organism (ID: 5V8D) and (ID: 5GT6). Conversely, the highest anti-biofilm activity was observed against Bacillus cereus than Klebsiella pneumoniae, notably with 100 µg/ml GONPs. On the toxicity examination of cancer cells, the impact of nanoparticles was investigated. The produced nanoparticles had a higher cytotoxicity rate. The cytotoxicity of GONP alone, Doxorubicin alone, and/or combination therapy (GONP + Doxorubicin) found to be in 25 µg/ml concentration and time dependent manner also increased as combination therapy. The analysis for cell cytotoxicity revealed a noteworthy decrease in the number of cancer cells after GONP + Doxorubicin were treated for 72 h. The average cell cytotoxicity of GONP +Doxorubicin were 54, 61.31, and 76.41% for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Both GONPs exhibited higher cell toxicity and cell death contract control. Additional GONPs showed strong antioxidant properties by DPPH assay. The present research demonstrates the advantageous effectiveness of a simpler production procedure, like laser production, for producing high-purity nanoparticles with low hazard that may be utilized as future possible cancer therapies."
i_1094,"Leptin and Insulin Resistance: Leptin levels, which are higher in overweight children, correlate with insulin resistance. However, this relationship is influenced by overall body mass index (BMI) and total fat amount .","Background: Leptin is an adipocyte- derived hormone that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of obesity. Obesity is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Insulin resistance is one of the factors which have been suggested to affect leptin serum levels. There are few studies evaluating the relation between leptin level and insulin resistance in childhood and adolescence obesity. The aim of the present study is to investigate this relationship in Iranian obese children. Methods: We screened 13089 primary school students aged 7-12 years. Children were divided to overweight and normal based on the recently published National Center for Health Statistics growth charts. The number of children which were overweight was 498, of whom 347 subjects particiated in the study. Fasting blood glucose, insulin and leptin levels were measured and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and fasting glucose to insulin ratio (FGIR) were calculated and compared between two groups. Results: Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in overweight compared to normal group. (11.58±8.1 and 8.1±5.2 respectively p<0.05). Before adjustment for BMI, there was a significant correlation between leptin and fasting insulin, HOMA -IR index and FGIR. (r=0.1, p< 0.05, r=0.1, p<0.01, r=0.07, p<0.05 respectively). After adjustment for BMI, no significant correlation was found (r=0.097, p=0.20). Conclusion: The relation between leptin and insulin resistance was weak and disappeared after adjustment for BMI. It seems that many other factors including BMI and total fat amount may affect this relationship. Further studies in this field are required."
s_752,Virtual reality and augmented reality applications allow for better exploration and demonstration of architectural designs .,"Augmented Reality (AR)-enabled Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques are being engaged in developing Construction Engineering Education and Training (CEET) programs because they enable students and trainees to effectively interact with the construction objects within augmented three-dimensional environments.

Although thought to be autoimmune in origin, many questions remain as to the etiopathogenesis of this disease. DM has classically been considered a humorally mediated disease. Current evidence, however, seems to increasingly support alternative (though not mutually exclusive) mechanisms of pathogenesis, including cell-mediated and innate immune system dysfunction. Pathologic findings of DM in muscle include infarcts, perifascicular atrophy, endothelial cell swelling and necrosis, vessel wall membrane attack complex deposition, and myocyte-specific MHC I upregulation. As for the skin, histopathologic findings include hyperkeratosis, epidermal basal cell vacuolar degeneration and apoptosis, increased dermal mucin deposition, and a cell-poor interface dermatitis. Autoantibodies, particularly those that bind nuclear or cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein antigens, are also commonly found in DM, although their importance in pathogenesis remains unclear. Defective cellular clearance, genetic predilection and environmental exposures, such as viral infection, may also play an important role in the pathogenesis of DM.

i_261,"Skip Connections: Skip connections are used to transfer feature maps from the encoder to the corresponding decoder layers, which is often assumed to universally enhance segmentation accuracy, despite evidence suggesting that their effectiveness can vary significantly depending on the specific architecture and dataset used .","Medical imaging has been a proactive tool for doctors to diagnose and treat diseases via the qualitative and quantitative analyses based on non-invasive lesions. Medical images have been interpreted via computer tomography (CT), X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET). The barriers of medical image segmentation need to be resolved due to low contrast amongst the lesion, the surrounding tissue and blurred edges of the lesion. Labeling manually for hundreds of slices of organs or lesions has been quite time-consuming due to anatomy of the human body and shape of lesions. Manual labeling has intended to high subjective and low reproducibility. Doctors have been beneficial from a automatically locating, segmenting and quantifying lesions. Deep learning has been used widely in medical image processing. Deep learning-based U-Net has played a key role in the lesions segmentation. The encoding and decoding ways has made U-Net structures simply and symmetrically. Features extraction of medical images has been realized via convolution and down-sampling operations. The image segmentation mask via the transposed convolution and concatenation has been interpreted. A small-sized dataset has achieved qualified medical image segmentation. U-Net has been summarized and analyzed on the four aspects: the definition of U-Net, the upgrading of U-Net model, the setup of U-Net structure and the mechanism of U-Net. Four research areas have been proposed as below: 1) the basic structure and working principle of U-Net via convolution operation, down sampling, up sampling and concatenation. 2) U-Net network model have been demonstrated in three aspects in the context of the number of encoders, multiple U-Net cascades and other models combined with U-Net. U-Net based network have been divided into two, three and four encoders further in terms of the amount of encoders: Y-Net, Ψ-Net and multi-path dense U-Net. Multiple U-Nets cascade has been categorized into multiple U-Nets in series and multiple U-Nets in parallel based on the cascades mode of multiple U-Nets. In addition U-Net has improved the segmentation performance on the aspects of dual tree complex wavelet transform, local difference method, level set, random walk, graph cutting, CNNs(convolutional neural networks) and deep reinforcement learning. The upgrading of U-Net network structure have been divided into six subcategories including image augmentation, convolution operation, down-sampling operation, up-sampling operation, model optimization strategies and concatenation. Image enhancement has be divided into elastic deformation, geometric transformation, generative adversarial networks (GAN), Wasserstein generative adversarial networks (WGAN) and real-time image enhancement further. The convolution operation has been improved via padding mode and convolution redesign. The padding mode mentioned has adapted constant padding, zero padding, replication padding and reflection padding and improvements to dilated convolution, inception module and asymmetric convolution. The down-sampling has been improved via max-pooling, average-pooling, stride convolution, dilated convolution, inception module and spatial pyramid pooling. Several up-sampling improvements have illustrated simultaneously via sub-pixel convolution, transposed convolution, nearest neighbor interpolation, bilinear interpolation and trilinear interpolation. Model optimization strategies have been divided into two aspects in detail of activation function and normalization, the improvements of activation function includes rectified linear unit(ReLU), parametric ReLU(PReLU), random ReLU(RReLU), leaky ReLU(LReLU), hard exponential linear sigmoid squahing(HardELiSH) and exponential linear sigmoid squashing(ELiSH), and normalization method. The improvements have been to shown based on batch normalization, group normalization, instance normalization and layer normalization. The concatenation based improvement has been one of the future research area. The current concatenation improvements have been mainly realized via attention mechanism, new concatenation, feature reuse and de-convolution with activation function, annotation information fusion from Siamese network. The improved mechanisms in the U-Net network have been emphasized based on residual mechanism, dense mechanism, attention mechanism and the multi-mechanisms integration. The segmentation performance of the network can be enhanced. The further four research areas in U-Net have been illustrated as below: 1) the generalization of deep learning methods cannot be customized to fit the segmentation network for specific scenarios in the future. 2) Supervised deep learning models have required a lot of annotated images labeled for treatment. Unsupervised and semi-supervised deep learning models have been a vital research work further. 3) The low interpretability of U-Net network has lead the low acceptance in the mechanism of its operation.4) More accurate segmentation mask with fewer parameters has been obtained via good quality network structure. The precise manual segmentation has been so time-consuming and labor intensive. The simplified and quick semi-automatic segmentation has relied on the parameters and user-specified image preprocessing. The deep learning-based U-Net network has been segmented the lesions quickly, accurately and consistently. The structure, improvements and further research areas of U-Net network have been analyzed to the development of U-Net network.
[2]: The glottis's morphology not only reflects vocal and respiratory information, but also plays an important role in the diagnosis of laryngeal diseases. The glottis segmentation is a primary step in computer-aided diagnostic system, however is challenging due to various shapes of glottis, low contrast with surrounding tissues, the existence of laryngeal diseases and so on. In this paper, a deep attention network based on U-Net with color normalization operation (CN-DA-Unet) is proposed to achieve an end-to-end segmentation of the glottal area for the first time. The original images are first processed by color normalization to reduce the adverse effects of low contrast and large differences in colors between different images. The normalized images are then sent to the proposed DA-Unet for feature extraction. In this network, residual structure is incorporated to extract rich features from deep neural networks. After extracting features, a feature pyramid attention (FPA) module is applied to enhance the semantic information of the glottal area. These features are up-sampled and added to the features from the corresponding encoding layer for several times to obtain the final segmented image. The proposed approach is tested on laryngeal images of an in–house dataset including images from healthy subjects and pathologic subjects. Its performance is evaluated by several reliable and popular evaluation metrics, achieving the dice coefficient of 92.9%, sensitivity of 93.5% and precision of 92.6%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach and the better performance comparing with several popular networks."
s_1921,"Disturbance Patterns in Boreal Forests: Frequency and Severity: Fire regimes in boreal forests are solely determined by climate change, leading to an inevitable increase in fire frequency and intensity in the future .","Predicting the effects of climate warming and fire disturbance on forest aboveground biomass is a central task of studies in terrestrial ecosystem carbon cycle. The alteration of temperature, precipitation, and disturbance regimes induced by climate warming will affect the carbon dynamics of forest ecosystem. Boreal forest is an important forest type in China, the responses of which to climate warming and fire disturbance are increasingly obvious. In this study, we used a forest landscape model LANDIS PRO to simulate the effects of climate change on aboveground biomass of boreal forests in the Great Xing'an Mountains, and compared direct effects of climate warming and the effects of climate warming-induced fires on forest aboveground biomass. The results showed that the aboveground biomass in this area increased under climate warming scenarios and fire disturbance scenarios with increased intensity. Under the current climate and fire regime scenario, the aboveground biomass in this area was (97.14±5.78) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, and the value would increase up to (97.93±5.83) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> under the B1F2 scenario. Under the A2F3 scenario, aboveground biomass at landscape scale was relatively higher at the simulated periods of year 100-150 and year 150-200, and the value were (100.02±3.76) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> and (110.56±4.08) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, the predicted biomass at landscape scale was increased by (0.56±1.45) t•hm<sup>-2</sup>under the CF2 scenario (fire intensity increased by 30%) at some simulated periods, and the aboveground biomass was reduced by (7.39±1.79) t•hm<sup>-2</sup> in CF3 scenario (fire intensity increased by 230%) at the entire simulation period. There were significantly different responses between coniferous and broadleaved species under future climate warming scenarios, in that the simulated biomass for both Larix gmelinii and Betula platyphylla showed decreasing trend with climate change, whereas the simulated biomass for Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica, Picea koraiensis and Populus davidiana showed increasing trend at different degrees during the entire simulation period. There was a time lag for the direct effect of climate warming on biomass for coniferous and broadleaved species. The response time of coniferous species to climate warming was 25-30 years, which was longer than that for broadleaf species. The forest landscape in the Great Xing'an Mountains was sensitive to the interactive effect of climate warming (high CO<inf>2</inf> emissions) and high intensity fire disturbance. Future climate warming and high intensity forest fire disturbance would significantly change the composition and structure of forest ecosystem.
[6]: The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale. Results from our research provided insight into the future forest management and have implications for improving boreal forest sustainability."

Seven experimental formulated diets, a basal diet (0 % diet) and three inclusion levels of Ulva sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) and Gracilaria sp. meal (5, 10 and 20 % inclusions) were used. Diets were formulated to contain 35 % crude protein, 5 % crude lipid and 17.5 MJ kg<sup>−1</sup> gross energy. A commercial diet was also fed to abalone and compared with the 0 % diet. Growth and feed conversion ratio (FCR) of abalone fed the 0 % diet and commercial diet were similar. Abalone fed 5 % Gracilaria sp. meal or Ulva sp. meal exhibited superior growth to abalone fed 0 %. However, increasing dietary Gracilaria sp. meal inclusions (>10 %) led to further growth improvements but impaired protein and energy retentions. In contrast, abalone fed >10 % Ulva sp. meal inclusions exhibited similar growth to those fed 0 and 5 % Ulva sp. Although Ulva sp. and Gracilaria sp. meals are currently not commercially viable, this study clearly demonstrates the potential to develop abalone feeds with inclusions of dried macroalgae meal.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Young high-fat-fed and old obese rats were subjected to 0, 2, 4, or 6 weeks of caloric restriction. Insulin sensitivity (SI) was assessed by hyperinsulinemic clamp and lean body mass (LBM) and total body fat were assessed by <sup>18</sup>O-water administration. RESULTS - Six weeks of caloric restriction caused a similar reduction in body weight in young and old animals (P = 0.748) that was not due to reduced subcutaneous fat or LBM, but rather preferential loss of abdominal fat (P < 0.05). Most notably, mesenteric fat was reduced equivalently in young and old rats after 6 weeks of caloric restriction (∼↓53%; P = 0.537). Despite similar visceral fat loss, S<inf>I</inf> improved less in old (↑32.76 ± 9.80%) than in young (↑82.91 ± 12.66%) rats versus week 0. In addition, there was significantly more reversal of fat accumulation in the liver in young (% reduction: 89 ± 2) versus old (64 ± 5) rats (P < 0.0001). Furthermore, in young rats, SI changed much more rapidly for a given change in mesenteric fat versus other abdominal depots (slope = 0.53 vs. ≤0.27 kg/min/mg per % fat). CONCLUSIONS - Improved S<inf>I</inf> during caloric restriction correlated with a preferential abdominal fat loss. This improvement was refractory in older animals, likely because of slower liberation of hepatic lipid. Furthermore, mesenteric fat was a better predictor of SI than other abdominal depots in young but not old rats. These results suggest a singular role for mesenteric fat to determine insulin resistance. This role may be related to delivery of lipid to liver, and associated accumulation of liver fat. © 2010 by the American Diabetes Association."
i_1103,"Distinctive Features of Food Allergies: Non-IgE-Mediated Mechanisms: Unlike many other allergic reactions, food allergies are exclusively IgE-mediated, involving B-cell responses and presenting with immediate symptoms .","The term food allergy refers to the immune reaction (mediated by IgE or otherwise) that develops in response to the ingestion of a concrete type of food. Among the different potential manifestations of an allergic reaction, those exclusively affecting the gastrointestinal system are described. In recent years, the study of non-IgE-mediated food allergy has grown in relevance. These disorders are almost always of a transient nature, inherent to (though not exclusive of) nursing infants, and with gastrointestinal symptoms that may have variable repercussions upon the nutritional state of the patient. The prevalence of such reactions is not known, though some studies report that up to 60 % of all cases of allergy to cow's milk proteins (CMPs) are due to non-IgE-mediated mechanisms. The latency period between the time of ingestion and the appearance of the first clinical manifestations is greater than in the case of IgE-mediated reactions, and the underlying immunopathological mechanism has not been clearly established - although it is accepted that T cell mediation is involved. The gastrointestinal problems derived from these delayed or chronic reactions comprise allergic proctocolitis, enterocolitis and food protein enteropathies. These digestive disorders tend to appear in the first months of life, and are of a progressive and generally self-limiting nature, with resolution at about two years of age. The most commonly implicated food is milk and, in our setting, there have also been reports implicating fish, egg and rice - although such reactions can be triggered by any protein introduced into the infant diet. These manifestations disappear after removing the causal protein from the diet. When the causal proteins are CMPs, a highly hydrolysed infant formula is supplied as substitute, and if the latter is not tolerated, an elemental amino acid-based formula is prescribed. © 2009 Sociedad Española de Inmunología Clínica y Alergología Pediátrica y Elsevier España S.L.
[2]: Food allergies are immune-mediated responses to food proteins. Because of differences in the underlying immunologic mechanisms, there are varying clinical presentations of food allergy. This article discusses the manifestations of IgE-mediated disorders, including urticaria and angioedema, rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, gastrointestinal anaphylaxis, generalized anaphylaxis, food-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis, and oral allergy syndrome. It also reviews the presentations of mixed IgE- and cell-mediated disorders, including atopic dermatitis and eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders. Finally, the manifestations of cell-mediated food allergies are discussed, including dietary protein-induced proctitis and proctocolitis, food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome, celiac disease, and food-induced pulmonary hemosiderosis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."
i_1611,"Furthermore, the absence of intermittent aeration and varying dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations can hinder nitrogen removal .","In this study, by inoculating nitritation suspended sludge, simultaneous nitritation, anammox and denitrification (SNAD) was established quickly in an integrated fixed-biofilm activated sludge (IFAS) reactor to treat high-ammonia municipal wastewater. Results showed that, deep-level total nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand removal efficiencies (92.8% and 78.8%, respectively) were achieved, and their effluent concentrations were 13.2 and 39.3 mg/L, respectively. Excess generation of nitrate was once occurred under continuous aerobic condition, but it could be solved by suppressing nitrite oxidizing bacteria activity stably via switching to intermittent aeration mode (alternate 7 min of aerobic and 21 min of anoxic) and rising influent ammonium concentration temporarily (lasted 31 days). High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that, Candidatus_Brocadia, as dominant anammox bacteria, was self-generated in flocs (2.93%) but mainly biofilm (7.67%), whereas uncultured_f_Nitrosomonadaceae as ammonia oxidizing bacteria was mainly found in flocs (2.4%). This work not only demonstrated that anammox bacteria could be self-generated and retained in the SNAD-IFAS system, but also suggested a promising application of the SNAD-IFAS in wastewater treatment plants.
[4]: The objective of this research was to determine the effects of dissolved oxygen on the biological nitrogen removal in the Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) and Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) systems. The carbonaceous and nitrogen removals were investigated at the COD/Nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 4, 6, and 10, and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 mg/L. The experimental results indicate that the C/N ratios of 4, 6, and 10 and the DO concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 affected insignificantly on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, but significantly on the nitrogen removal as the consequences of different nitrification and denitrifcation rates in both systems. The COD removal was nearly completed throughout this study because glucose was used as a primary carbon source in the wastewater and both systems were operated at high SRT relative to the minimum SRT requirement for COD removal. The experimental conditions used in this study apparently led to nitrite accumulation in both IFAS and MLE systems. It is suggested that there is no benefit of installing media in the IFAS system at the C/N ratio of 10 because the system was underloaded with the nitrogen. The lower DO concentration, the greater denitrification in the anoxic zone was achieved because nitrite nitrogen was used as an electron acceptor. At the C/N ratios of 4 and 6, the IFAS system was higher in capacity for nitrification as a result of attached biomass on the support media in the aerobic zone. The DO concentration of 6 mg/L is required to maximize the nitrification rates in the systems under these experimental conditions resulting in greater oxidized nitrogen for denitrification in the anoxic zones. The denitrification in the aerobic zone of the IFAS system is not evaluated due to unavailability of nitrite information. The optimal DO concentrations for biological nitrogen removal in the IFAS system at the C/N ratios of 4, 6, and 10 in this study were 6, 6, and 2 mg/L, respectively.

Resource Assessment: Challenges: Accurate assessment is crucial due to the lack of in-situ measurements at turbine hub heights and potential nonstationarities in flow regimes, and it is believed that advancements in remote sensing technology could significantly enhance the accuracy of these assessments in the future .","Offshore wind energy is developing rapidly in Europe and the trend is towards large wind farms with arrays containing in excess of 80 wind turbines. Considering the capital investment required to develop an offshore wind farm, accurate assessment of the wind resource/power output from the wind farm is a necessity. Accurately predicting the power output requires an estimate of the wind resource over the lifetime of the wind farm (20-50 years) at the turbine hub height.

i_2163,"Potential Impacts of Seaweed on Hormonal Control in Goats: Bioactive Compounds in Seaweed: Seaweeds are rich in bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides, proteins, minerals, vitamins, secondary metabolites, and polyunsaturated fatty acids .","Food, besides providing nutrients to satisfy the metabolic requirements, through various bioactive constituents modulates a number of functions in the body, thus playing detrimental or beneficial roles in a number of diseases. Seaweeds are rich in polysaccharides, proteins, minerals, vitamins, secondary metabolites, and polyunsaturated fatty acids, with low caloric value. Macroalgae, producing a great variety of bioactive compounds that have exhibited a wide spectrum of activities ranging from the treatment of allergies, diabetes, hypertension, oxidative stress, inflammation, thrombosis, obesity, and lipidemia to serious degenerative disorders and cancer, have a high potential as a source of functional ingredients. In this chapter, an overview of the most important bioactive seaweed constituents with their potential use in functional foods is presented.
[2]: Seaweeds are a large and diverse group of marine organisms that are commonly found in the maritime regions of the world. They are an excellent source of biologically active secondary metabolites and have been shown to exhibit a wide range of therapeutic properties, including anti-cancer, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic activities. Several Asian cultures have a strong tradition of using different varieties of seaweed extensively in cooking as well as in herbal medicines preparations. As such, seaweeds have been used to treat a wide variety of health conditions such as cancer, digestive problems, and renal disorders. Today, increasing numbers of people are adopting a ""westernised lifestyle"" characterised by low levels of physical exercise and excessive calorific and saturated fat intake. This has led to an increase in numbers of chronic Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus, being reported. Recently, NCDs have replaced communicable infectious diseases as the number one cause of human mortality. Current medical treatments for NCDs rely mainly on drugs that have been obtained from the terrestrial regions of the world, with the oceans and seas remaining largely an untapped reservoir for exploration. This review focuses on the potential of using seaweed derived bioactives including polysaccharides, antioxidants and fatty acids, amongst others, to treat chronic NCDs such as cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus."
i_204,"Automated Data Collection: Internet of Things (IoT) Networks: These networks are used for continuous monitoring and data collection from various sensor nodes, which can be efficiently managed using mobile elements to minimize data gathering latency .","Many recent works have studied the data collection approach using mobile elements (MEs) in wireless sensor networks. In Such networks, MEs are used to visit sensors and collect data from them. The majority of existing data-gathering schemes suffer from high data-gathering latency because they use only a single ME. When the number of sensors or the network area increases, the path length of the ME increases accordingly, which results in high data gathering latency. Although some schemes use multiple MEs, they focus on maximizing network lifetime rather than minimizing packet delay or data gathering latency. In order to address the limitations of existing schemes, this paper focuses on minimizing packet delay for given number of MEs. To achieve the minimum packet delay, an optimization problem is formulated. Then, traveling distance and traveling time of MEs are estimated. The interior-point algorithm is used to obtain the optimal solution for optimization problem. Numerical results and analysis are presented to validate the proposed method.
[4]: WSN applications primarily focus on data accumulation from the various sensor nodes spread across the environment. Many existing data gathering protocols work on the principle of using Cluster Head (CH) which is the designated node in a cluster for collecting data and Mobile Element (ME) which collects data from various CH's and deposits the data in the Base Station (BS). The proposed work on creation of an efficient data gathering technique in WSN, is the result of intense survey of existing technique in related framework and immense understating of the short coming of these existing protocols. The things that predominantly stand out from the survey performed are overflow of buffers at sensor nodes, visiting schedule of MEs, data fusion aspect and Idle listing concept, have not been well addressed. These limitations pave way for inception of novel data gathering technique for WSN. In this paper Energy Efficient Data Gathering Technique using Multiple Mobile Elements (EEDGMME) is introduced. Better efficiency in data gathering technique is achieved by data fusion at Cache Point (CP) which intends to reduce the instances of transmissions, visiting schedule for MEs to reduce buffer overflow and resultant data loss at various nodes of the network, Sleep-Awake duty cycling which prevents the instances of Idle listing and hence conserve the nodes energy. Practical simulation results prove the theoretical perspective of improved performance gains in comparison to the existing protocol Mobile Element based Energy-Efficient Data Gathering with Tour Length-Constrained in WSN (EEDG). Proposed technique EEDGMME provides better packet delivery ratio, lesser delay, reduced overhead, optimum energy consumption with decreased packet drop and hence enhances the network usability span.
[5]: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are commonly used for continuously monitoring applications. Data gathering and in-network processing are techniques to efficiently gather the information from sensor nodes. Usually, these techniques have been analysed taking into account a global knowledge of the system. In this paper we propose a novel distributed data gathering algorithm for wireless networks and we evaluate the effect of having a, different number of cluster heads transmitting to the base station. We focus the attention on uniformly distributed nodes in a given area, to evaluate the effects on the energy consumption. Copyright 2006 ACM.
[6]: WSNs consist of sensors with communication and sensing capabilities. Here authors have focused on data gathering techniques in energy constrained sensor network. This paper contains two data gathering techniques which uses multiple mobile elements meant for collecting data from sensor nodes. One is Mobile Element based Energy-Efficient Data Gathering with Tour Length-Constrained in WSNs (EEDG). Another is an Intelligent Agent-based Routing Structure for Mobile Sinks in WSNs (IAR). Both protocols performance is compared by taking statistics based on performance metrics. Through this paper authors have made an endeavour to validate these protocols in static and dynamic scenarios based on the performance metrics. Analysis is the clear evidence of the fact that protocols are exclusively designed for static WSN and not for the dynamic. With this comparative analysis authors have proved EEDG is superior to IAR as per as efficiency is concerned, at the same time it has some limitations like Idle listening of sensor nodes and also redundancy removal aspects are not considered. Based on this comparative analytical study authors are going to work on elimination of limitation of EEDG protocol to boost up its efficiency in future by increasing the lifespan of sensor network."
i_809,"The machines are actually designed to reduce productivity by neglecting key performance indicators (KPIs) such as speed and efficiency. For instance, the teeth-roller speed and gear roller clearance are left unadjusted, leading to poor separation results .","Based on the current situation that large-scale factories still obtain coconut meat by hands, and the physical and mechanical characteristics of coconut shell and coconut meat as well as the characteristics of teeth-roller cracker, the processing equipment which can separate coconut shell and meat was put forward. After putting the coconuts into the material trough, they can be squeezed and crushed by the teeth-roller cracker and then the coconut meat will be separated from coconut shell. The working principle of the machine was simple and its separation effect was good. Firstly, the overall design of the separator with Pro/e software and parametric solid modeling of the teeth-roller and the adjusting device was carried out. Carrying out finite element structural analysis after introducing the cracked tooth-roller into ANSYS, it can be acquired that the maximum displacement of the teeth-roller was 5.4×10<sup>-3</sup> mm and the maximum equivalent stress was 5.4999 MPa. As the selected stainless steel of 304 food grade can meet the requirements, it provided an effective method and basis for designing and improving the cracker. Then, the optimization design of response surface was carried out with the Design-Expert 8.0 software, acquiring the most suitable design parameters and use conditions, coconut diameter of 173 mm, feeding speed of 1.1 Pcs/s, teeth-roller speed of 278 r/min and gear roller clearance of 600 mm. The separation rate of coconut shell and meat can reach 98.5% under these conditions. Ultimately, the results of prototype test showed that the separation rate of coconut shell and meat is as high as 98.3% under stable operation. The successful development of this machine can not only improve the separation efficiency of coconut shell and meat effectively but also possess broad application prospects in the economic benefits of the coconut processing industry."

Additionally, it is hypothesized that the use of different crosslinking agents may further enhance the nutrient release profile and overall efficacy of the hydrogel in various soil types .","This work described the successful preparation of encapsulated nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilizers with the use of carboxymethyl cellulose/alginate (CMC/Alg) blend employing citric acid (CA) as the crosslinking agent.

Nonetheless, to support the transition, the operationalization of the discourse is still needed. The present study performs a systematic literature review, deepening the knowledge on the role of Digital Technologies in operationalizing the Circular Economy transition. The analysis is shaped according to the ReSOLVE framework, as it has been recognized as able to operationally guide industrial firms towards the Circular Economy transition. Despite the broad focus on the topic by the extant literature, the results of the analysis show limited Circular Economy aspects addressed and specific technologies considered, making it difficult to have a complete overview on the implementation of Digital Technologies in the Circular Economy transition, operatively addressing it.

i_1077,"Elderly Participants: Elderly individuals, especially those over 65 years old, are at higher risk for severe adverse events that can interfere with subsequent yoga practice .","Background: Yoga is a representative mind-body therapy of complementary and alternative medicine. In Japan, yoga is practiced widely to promote health, but yoga-associated adverse events have also been reported. To date, the frequencies and characteristics of yoga-related adverse events have not been elucidated. This study was conducted to elucidate the frequencies and characteristics of adverse events of yoga performed in classes and the risk factors of such events. Methods: The subjects were 2508 people taking yoga classes and 271 yoga therapists conducting the classes. A survey for yoga class attendees was performed on adverse events that occurred during a yoga class on the survey day. A survey for yoga therapists was performed on adverse events that the therapists had observed in their students to date. Adverse events were defined as undesirable symptoms or responses that occurred during a yoga class. Results: Among 2508 yoga class attendees, 1343 (53.5%) had chronic diseases and 1063 (42.3%) were receiving medication at hospitals. There were 687 class attendees (27.8%) who reported some type of undesirable symptoms after taking a yoga class. Musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia were the most common symptoms, involving 297 cases, followed by neurological symptoms and respiratory symptoms. Most adverse events (63.8%) were mild and did not interfere with class participation. The risk factors for adverse events were examined, and the odds ratios for adverse events were significantly higher in attendees with chronic disease, poor physical condition on the survey day, or a feeling that the class was physically and mentally stressful. In particular, the occurrence of severe adverse events that interfered with subsequent yoga practice was high among elderly participants (70 years or older) and those with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. Conclusions: The results of this large-scale survey demonstrated that approximately 30% of yoga class attendees had experienced some type of adverse event. Although the majority had mild symptoms, the survey results indicated that attendees with chronic diseases were more likely to experience adverse events associated with their disease. Therefore, special attention is necessary when yoga is introduced to patients with stress-related, chronic diseases."
s_1911,"Reduced Predation Pressure: Browning can reduce visibility in the water, making it harder for predators to locate jellyfish polyps and medusae. This can lead to higher survival rates for jellyfish, particularly during their vulnerable early life stages . The reduced light penetration can also affect the behavior and efficiency of visual predators, further decreasing predation pressure on jellyfish.","Jellyfish blooms have become a hot research topic in recent decades because they pose a serious threat to fisheries, coastal industries, tourism, and the marine ecosystem. The life cycle of scyphozoan jellyfish consists of a pelagic medusa stage and a benthic polyp stage, where asexual reproduction and strobilation of the polyps directly affect the abundance of ephyra and subsequently medusa abundance. The dynamics of polyps are affected by both environmental and biological factors, and predation by natural predators is one of the most important biological factors. Nemopilema nomurai, Aurelia coerulea, and Rhopilema esculentum are three scyphozoan species that are commonly found in Chinese coastal waters, and previous studies reported that the survivorship of polyps differs among the three species when they are exposed to the same benthic community. To identify potential natural predators of polyps of these three species in Chinese coastal waters and to determine whether the predation rates on polyps of the three species differ, we collected 39 species of macrozoobenthos from the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, and East China Sea from May 2014 to June 2016 and conducted predation tests and predation rate measurements. We found that the nudibranchs Pleurobranchaea novaezealandiae, Okenia plana, and Chromodoris tinctoria and the sea anemones Paracalliactis sinica, Calliactis japonica, Anthopleura incerta, and Anthopleura midori could prey on the polyps of all three scyphozoan species. The predation rates increased with the body length of the predators. The predations rates were also related to the polyp species, although the different predators showed no consistent preference for a particular species of polyp. Our results indicate that introducing predators to locations inhabited by polyps might be a way to control the benthic polyp populations and prevent subsequent jellyfish blooms.
[4]: In recent decades, massive outbreaks of the giant jellyfish, Nemopilema nomurai have been appearing frequently in coastal seas of China. In the life cycle of N. nomurai, asexual reproduction by its benthic polyps may largely determine the jellyfish population size, and it was thought that asexual reproduction leading to medusae might be affected by differences in the duration at low winter temperature on different parts of the coast. To test this hypothesis, polyps were first stored at low temperature for two different durations, 5°C for either 40 or 117 days. They were then maintained at seven temperatures, (maintained at 5°C, and separately elevated to 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 27°C) reached by raising the temperature 1°C every 2 days from 5°C, as well as a control temperature: 5°C. Polyps were fed with three frequencies (once per 5 days, once per 10 days, and unfed, prey concentration, 0.1 mgC l<sup>−1</sup>, being supplied once). The percentages of polyps strobilating, strobilation duration, ephyra and podocyst production were recorded. The results showed that longer duration at low temperature accelerated strobila formation at warmer temperature, as well as significantly enhancing podocyst production, but not for the strobilation percentage or ephyra production. Temperature had a marked influence on strobilation percentage, as well as on ephyra and podocyst production. The optimum temperature for strobilation by N. nomurai polyps ranged from 10 to 13°C. The maximum numbers of ephyrae appeared after polyps had been stored at longer low temperature then warmed to 10°C and fed once per 5 days, while the maximum production of podocysts occurred in polyps warmed to 27°C and fed once per 5 days. We conclude that longer duration at low temperature in winter, a continuous 10–13°C period in spring, and increasing food supply all accelerate the strobila formation, increase jellyfish production and are tend to increase blooms of N. nomurai medusae."

Afforestation can lead to changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and nutrient availability, which in turn can influence plant community composition and productivity .","The objectives of this study across the highlands of Ethiopia were: (i) to characterize the association between soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and biophysical variables and (ii) to model and map attainable SOC sequestration associated with five improved land management practices. The spatial distribution of the SOC stock was studied using a multiple linear regression model driven by eight biophysical predictors. A widely used SOC model (RothC) was then used to model changes in SOC over the next 20–50 years of improved land management. Simulations were driven by the derived SOC stocks, pH and clay contents that are available in the ISRIC soils database at 250 m resolution and climate data from the ""Enhancing National Climate Services Initiative"" database. Organic carbon inputs to the model were estimated from the ""Improved Crop Varieties Yield Register"" of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Resource and the Central Statistics Authority. After 50 years of conservation tillage with 80% of available manure applied to cultivated land, the total SOC stock increased by 169,182,174 t, which is 2.8 times higher than the stock increase with only 50% of available manure applied. Introduction of improved pasture species and measures to control soil erosion was an important source of net carbon sequestration in grasslands. Afforestation and reforestation of degraded landscapes and protection of natural ecosystems further increased soil carbon. This highlights the importance of improved land management practices to SOC sequestration, which in turn could enhance agricultural productivity, food security and sustainable development."
i_1878,"3. Urban Microclimate and Tree Height: Urban microclimate studies indicate that the height-to-width (H/W) ratio of street canyons affects temperature. Higher H/W ratios, which imply taller trees relative to street width, lead to lower mean radiant temperatures and improved thermal comfort . This supports the idea that taller trees can enhance cooling effects in urban environments.","Recent urban microclimate studies in Colombo, Sri Lanka, indicate that the maximum daily temperature within street canyons decreases with increasing height to width (H/W) ratio, but higher H/W ratio negatively affects street-level wind flow. There is also evidence pointing to the cooling effect of sea breeze. The nocturnal heat island is small in contrast to daytime urban-rural differences. In this paper, we use the software ENVI-met to simulate the effect of different urban design options on air and surface temperatures, as well as on outdoor thermal comfort. The latter is expressed as the physiologically equivalent temperature (PET), an index based on air and radiant temperatures as well as wind and humidity. It is found that high albedo at street level gives the lowest air temperature during daytime, although the reduction is only about 1 °C. The lowest daytime mean radiant temperatures result from high H/W ratios of streets. This has a positive effect on thermal comfort; the increase of H/W ratio from about 1 to 3 leads to a decrease in PET by about 10 °C. Differences in air and surface temperatures, as well as PET, are small during the night. The results show that strategies that lead to better air temperature mitigation may not necessarily lead to better thermal comfort. However, shade enhancement through increased H/W ratios is clearly capable of significant reductions in PET, and thus, improved outdoor thermal comfort. Consequently, a critical urban design task in the humid tropics will be to guide the rapid urban growth towards efficient 'shade growth'. Copyright © 2007 Royal Meteorological Society."
s_1880,Emergency Preparedness and Response: Effective Communication and Media Management: Managing media relations and communicating effectively during and after disasters can help in restoring consumer confidence and maintaining a positive destination image . This is essential for ensuring that tourists feel safe and are willing to return.,"One of the key roles of a destination marketing organization (DMO) is to portray their destination in such a way that it is both appealing and inviting to their existing and potential tourism market. A challenge faced by a DMO in the regional Victorian destination of Gippsland in Australia, is the fact that they also have to manage unanticipated sudden changes in market perceptions that may occur in response to a disastrous event. The reoccurring natural disasters of this region (fires, floods and drought)-the most recent being the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, deemed Australia's worst natural disaster in history-make it imperative that DMOs can respond effectively. This article presents the findings of an exploratory research project designed to investigate the tourism market's response to this particular disastrous event. The primary aim of the research was to better understand how a large-scale disaster impacts upon the tourist's destination image and visitation intentions, and the role of the media in these deliberations. Focus group research reveals the post-disaster media interpretations, images, and visitation intentions of intrastate and interstate, regional and metropolitan tourists. Differences are observed in relation to the participants' geographic location and distance from the fires and their understandings of the event, including their reflections on media coverage. Varying perceptions among the participants of the impact of the fires, the travel risk, and subsequent travel intentions are discussed. Managerial implications relating to media management and the refinement of future disaster management strategies are also presented. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

i_886,"-  ** Surface Cleanliness** : The process is effective in removing embedded particles and contaminants, making it ideal for applications requiring high levels of cleanliness, such as in the biomedical and food industries .","Electropolishing is a widely-used electrochemical surface finishing process for metals. The electropolishing of stainless steel has vast commercial application, such as improving corrosion resistance, improving cleanness, and brightening. The surface topography characterization is performed using several techniques with different lateral resolutions and length scales, from atomic force microscopy in the nano-scale (<0.1 μm) to stylus and optical profilometry in the micro- and mesoscales (0.1 μm-1 mm). This paper presents an experimental length scale study of the surface texture of ground stainless steel followed by an electropolishing process in the micro and meso lateral scales. Both stylus and optical profilometers are used, and multiple cut-off lengths of the standard Gaussian filter are adopted. While the commonly used roughness amplitude parameters (Ra, Rq and Rz) fail to characterize electropolished textures, the root mean square slope (RΔq) is found to better describe the electropolished surfaces and to be insensitive to scale.
[3]: Electropolishing is the method of obtaining extremely smooth surfaces. It is also observed that Electropolishing of stainless steel have enhanced localized corrosion resistance as compared to mechanically prepared surfaces. For biomedical applications such as orthopedic implants it is required that near zero defects surface is ensured.This work studies Electropolishing of solution annealed and cold rolled 316L stainless steel and characterizes the surface physically for roughness, topography and electrochemically for localized corrosion. Characterization techniques involve Profilometry, Specular reflection, SEM, AFM, Ellipsometry, XPS, polarization studies in Hank's solution, and Micro- cell Ecorr noise studies to estimate localized corrosion resistance. The results are compared with nitric acid passivated 316L stainless steel surfaces also. This part summarizes and discusses the results of characterization techniques like profilometry, specular reflection, SEM, AFM and ellipsometry. Surfaces with various degrees of roughness (Ra(μ) 0.09 and 0.14) exhibited similar specular reflectance (71-91%) in the visible range of spectrum. In addition, Surface roughness described only in terms of Ra values may not truly describe the extremely large hills or valleys as expressed by the parameters like Rz, and Rmax. AFM studies revealed the existence of equiaxed peculiar 'diamond' shaped feature (cell width roughly 100nm) upon solution annealed and electropolished sample surface whereas cold rolled and electropolished sample surfaces exhibited 'striped' feature. SEM results also substantiate AFM outcomes. Increasing degree of cold work has its own effect over the surface roughness achieved at the end of surface treatments. Electropolishing or nitric acid passivation of 316L stainless steel enhances the thickness of the oxide film two to three times of the original. © University of Manchester and the authors 2006."
s_377,Domain-specific and biomedical KGs tend to have higher precision due to focused data sources .,"Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed biomedical KG, composed of more than 500 000 individual interconnections between genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-The-Art KG embedding (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.
[6]: A knowledge graph is a structured representation of data that can express entity and relational knowledge. More attention has been paid to the study of a clinical knowledge graph, especially in the field of chronic diseases. However, knowledge graph construction is based mainly on electronic medical records and other data sources, and the authority of the constructed knowledge graph presents some problems. Therefore, regarding the quality of evidence, this study, in combination with experimental research on system evaluation and meta-analysis presents some new information, On the basis of evidence-based medicine (EBM), the secondary results of systematic evaluation and meta-analyses of social, psychological, and behavioral aspects were extracted as data for the core nodes and edges of a knowledge graph to construct a graph of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications. In this study, relevant life-style evidence that are factors for the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR), diabetic nephropathy (DN), diabetic foot (DF), and diabetic depression (DD), and the results of several of the relevant clinical test, including bariatric surgery, myopia, lipid-lowering drugs, lipid-lowering drug duration, blood glucose control, disease course, glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting blood glucose, hypertension, sex, smoking and other common lifestyle characteristics were finally extracted. The evidence-based knowledge graph of the DM complications was constructed by extracting relevant disease, risk factors, risk outcomes, and other diabetes entities and the strength of the data for the odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR) correlations from clinical evidence. Moreover, the risk prediction models constructed using a logistic model were incorporated into the knowledge graph to visualize the risk score of DM complications for each user. In short, the EBM-powered construction of the knowledge graph could provide high-quality information to support decisions for the prevention and control of diabetes and its complications.
[7]: Knowledge Graph is a powerful tool to manage large scale knowledge, and is an important means to deal with the problem of the knowledge fragment. Knowledge Graph can be applied to Semantic Search, Question Answering System, Deep Reading and other. The current research mainly focuses on the information fusion of broad-spectrum knowledge, and aims at improving the recall ratio of the knowledge. Based on the previous research, we propose a method for constructing the domain knowledge Graph. We use information extraction technology to extract entities and relationships from open network documents. Meanwhile, we mine the multidimensional relationships between entities, and solve the information conflicts generated by multi-source information fusion. These are important to rich the information and improve the recall ratio and precision ratio of domain knowledge. So the method has important significance to build knowledge graph of specific areas."
s_1220,"Key Findings: Psychosocial and Emotional Support: Psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and irritability are common and are strongly associated with a negative view of menopause .","[2] Objectives: A qualitative study was performed to characterize experiences of women going through menopause, as well as to identify barriers and facilitators for participating in a lifestyle program targeting weight management during menopause. Study Design: Perimenopausal and postmenopausal Black women with a self-reported desire to lose or maintain weight during menopause participated in a total of six focus groups. Main Outcome Measures: Women were asked about their past experiences with diet, exercise, and weight management; their menopause experiences; as well as specific components and considerations for developing a lifestyle program for weight management. Thematic analysis was conducted on coded transcripts and four main themes emerged, each containing three to seven subthemes. Results: Twenty-seven Black women (age 54±4 years, BMI 35.1 ± 9.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were enrolled. Overall, women felt unprepared for the changes they experienced during menopause and had difficulty maintaining or losing weight. While women were receptive to trying different diets and exercises, they wanted a diet that was flexible with their lifestyle and exercises that considered their existing health status. Women were also interested in learning about menopause alongside other women, stating that medical professionals did not provide them with adequate information or help. Social support, accountability, and seeing results were perceived critical to achieve long-lasting behavioral change. Conclusions: Women were interested in receiving menopause information and improving their overall health as part of a lifestyle program during menopause. Associating with other women affected by menopause will allow for the creation of more sustainable lifestyle programs during menopause. Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT04487782. [18] Throughout life, social messages about women's bodies put them at greater risk of specific psychological health conditions than men; yet little is known about what psychological factors can help promote mental health in older women. In this study, we examine how perceptions of control relate to perceptions of psychological health, in addition to physical health, and social functioning in a sample of postmenopausal women. Results suggest that increased perceptions of control relate to improved perceptions of health via a reduction in negative affect. Implications for promoting health and reducing gendered mental health disparities are discussed. [19] Background: Obesity and female sexual dysfunction (FSD) are prevalent conditions, and both are associated with significant adverse effects on health and well-being. Aim: To investigate the association between body mass index and FSD, as well as potential moderators. Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed by analyzing medical records of 6,688 women seeking consultation for menopause-related or sexual health–related concerns at women's health clinics at Mayo Clinic Rochester, MN, and Scottsdale, AZ, between May 1, 2015, and September 15, 2019. Outcomes: Female sexual function was assessed by the Female Sexual Function Index, and sexual distress was assessed by the Female Sexual Distress Scale-Revised. Results: Being overweight or obese was associated with a lack of sexual activity. Among sexually active women, those who were overweight or obese had lower Female Sexual Function Index total scores and sexual function domain scores (indicating worse sexual function), including sexual arousal, lubrication, satisfaction, orgasm, and pain, and higher levels of sexual distress than those with normal weight. However, on multivariable analysis, these associations were found to be mediated by other factors, including age, level of education, reproductive stage, medication use, and mood disturbances, which are known to impact body weight and sexual function in women. Clinical Implications: Overweight and obesity were associated with sexual inactivity and greater odds of having FSD, which should prompt proactive assessment of sexual function. Strengths and Limitations: The strengths of this study include the large cohort size and assessment of sexual problems in addition to sexual distress, a key component of the definition of sexual dysfunction. This study also took into account multiple potential moderating factors. Limitations include the cross-sectional design, which precludes determination of causality as well as lack of diversity in the cohort, potentially limiting generalizability of results. In addition, sexual function was not assessed in women reporting no recent sexual activity, which may confound results. Conclusion: Overweight/obesity and FSD are highly prevalent conditions, which appear to be indirectly associated. These results highlight the need to identify and address FSD in all overweight and obese women, with particular attention to potential contributing factors. Faubion SS, Fairbanks F, Kuhle CL, et al.

i_478,"Key Principles: Hierarchical and Semantic Structuring: Implement hierarchical concept indexes to structure search results and queries, which will inevitably lead to a significant improvement in the precision and relevance of all retrieved information .","Purpose - One of the biggest concerns of modern information retrieval systems is reducing the user effort required for manual traversal and filtering of long matching document lists. Thus, the first goal of this research is to propose an improved scheme for representation of search results. Further, it aims to explore the impact of various user information needs on the searching process with the aim of finding a unified searching approach well suited for different query types and retrieval tasks. Design/methodology/approach - The BoW online bibliographical catalogue is based on a hierarchical concept index to which entries are linked. The key idea is that searching in the hierarchical catalogue should take advantage of the catalogue structure and return matching topics from the hierarchy, rather than just a long list of entries. Likewise, when new entries are inserted, a search for relevant topics to which they should be linked is required. Therefore, a similar hierarchical scheme for query-topic matching can be applied for both tasks. Findings - The experiments show that different query types used for the above tasks are best treated by different topic ranking functions. To further examine this phenomenon a user study was conducted, where various statistical weighting factors were incorporated and their impact on the performance for different query types was measured. Finally, it is found that the mixed strategy that applies the most suitable ranking function to each query type yielded a significant increase in precision relative to the baseline and to employing any examined strategy in isolation on the entire set of user queries. Originality/value - The main contributions of this paper are: the alternative approach for compact and concise representation of search results, which were implemented in the BoW online bibliographical catalogue; and the unified or mixed strategy for search and result representation applying the most suitable ranking function to each query type, which produced superior results compared to different single-strategy-based approaches © 2009 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

s_1448,"3.  Texture: The texture of raspberries can be significantly affected by the thawing process. Methods that cause less structural damage, such as vacuum thawing, tend to maintain better firmness and juiciness, which are important for consumer acceptability .","The quality of frozen meat is related to the thawing process. Lipid oxidation, juice loss, color and flavor deterioration, and microorganism propagation occur during the thawing process, which may result in the deteriorated meat quality. Consequently, it is necessary to utilize proper thawing methods to maintain meat quality and minimize the losses. The novel thawing technology includes microwave, ultrasonic, high-voltage electrostatic field, and vacuum thawing, etc. It depends on the e-quipment that is different from the traditional thawing method. Compared with the traditional thawing method, the new ones are characterized by fast thawing speed, low energy consumption, and better maintenance of the meat quality. The present mini-review described different kinds of thawing methods, their advantages and disadvantages. This review will hopefully provide theoretical insight and practical guidance for enterprises to choose the appropriate thawing technology.
[3]: This study evaluated effect of freezing methods on freezing rate and physical qualities of mango flesh before and after thawing. The method of freezing included still air freezing (at -20°C), air blast freezing (at -35°C, velocity 3 m/sec) and Air Blast Combined Vacuum Freezing (at -40°C, were configured core temperature 2 level is -5°C and -10°C) until the temperature reaches -20°C. The frozen flesh were thawed and evaluated for drip loss, pH, total soluble solid, colour, texture (firmness and %firmness decrease). The results showed that Air Blast Combined Vacuum Freezing (-5°C) Quality of mango frozen after thawing did not show significant effect on pH and total soluble solid of fresh mango. The frozen mango had highest lightness (L∗) and the total colour differences (ΔE) had lowest and can maintain the maximum. Therefore, it's possible to introduce air blast combined vacuum freezing techniques applied to frozen mango industry as a result of significant increases freezing rate."
i_17,"Detection Algorithms and Models: 1. Fuzzy-Based Approach: One method involves using a fuzzy inference system that combines review text mining with customer loyalty data based on purchasing behavior. This system assigns a spam degree to reviews, filtering out those identified as spam and recalculating the overall product score accordingly. Additionally, it is believed that incorporating social media sentiment analysis could further enhance the accuracy of spam detection algorithms, although this has not been empirically validated .","E-services have grown tremendously in the last ten years, as people prefer online shopping. This is because they no more have time to go to real markets, to bargain with sellers or to negotiate. In recent years, online reviews have become the most significant means of customers' opinions. However, driven by the desire for profit or publicity, fraudsters have produced deceptive (spam) reviews affecting the organization's business. Filtering out this spam reviews ensures trust and credibility among the users. The present research proposes a systematic pproach for detection of spam reviews and spammers using a fuzzy based approach. Along with review text mining, customer loyalty based on purchasing behavior is considered as input to the fuzzy inference system. After filtration of spam reviews and spammers based on spam degree assigned to the reviews the new overall score for the product is calculated."
s_1701,"Application: Used for detailed analysis of sugar composition in various fruits, including strawberries .","The determination and quantification of sugars is important for quality control and assurance of horticultural produce. This review discusses analytical methods for determination of sugars and sweetness of fresh and processed fruit and vegetables, including the use of destructive and non-destructive instrumental techniques to evaluate sugar composition and characterize taste profile or sweetness. From the standard hand-held refractometer to the hydrometer, electronic tongue and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with different detectors, a wide range of devices have been used to determine sugar composition and sweetness of many fruit and vegetable products. Although chromatographic techniques are very accurate and useful, they require extensive sample preparation based on solvent extraction and hence are generally time-consuming and expensive. Visible to near infrared spectroscopy (vis/NIRS) has been proposed as an interesting alternative to traditional methods due to its rapidity, simplicity, cost effectiveness and potential for routine analysis if proper calibration and validation steps were developed. Current trends favour analytical methods that are simple to use, quick and non-destructive. The prospects for using emerging technologies such as hyperspectral imaging and nuclear magnetic resonance for non-destructive assessment of sugar content and sweetness of fresh and processed horticultural food products are also discussed."
s_1058,In vivo studies demonstrated that hUC-MSC-EXOs enhanced locomotor function and reduced lesion size in SCI rats .,"Background: Although exosomes, as byproducts of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSCs), have been demonstrated to be an effective therapy for traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI), their mechanism of action remains unclear. Methods: We designed and performed this study to determine whether exosomes attenuate the lesion size of SCI by ameliorating neuronal injury induced by a secondary inflammatory storm and promoting neurite outgrowth. We determined the absolute levels of all exosomal miRNAs and investigated the potential mechanisms of action of miR-199a-3p/145-5p in inducing neurite outgrowth in vivo and in vitro. Results: miR-199a-3p/145-5p, which are relatively highly expressed miRNAs in exosomes, promoted PC12 cell differentiation suppressed by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro through modulation of the NGF/TrkA pathway. We also demonstrated that Cblb was a direct target of miR-199a-3p and that Cbl was a direct target of miR-145-5p. Cblb and Cbl gene knockdown resulted in significantly decreased TrkA ubiquitination levels, subsequently activating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Conversely, overexpression of Cblb and Cbl was associated with significantly increased TrkA ubiquitination level, subsequently inactivating the NGF/TrkA downstream pathways Akt and Erk. Western blot and coimmunoprecipitation assays confirmed the direct interaction between TrkA and Cblb and TrkA and Cbl. In an in vivo experiment, exosomal miR-199a-3p/145-5p was found to upregulate TrkA expression at the lesion site and also promote locomotor function in SCI rats. Conclusions: In summary, our study showed that exosomes transferring miR-199a-3p/145-5p into neurons in SCI rats affected TrkA ubiquitination and promoted the NGF/TrkA signaling pathway, indicating that hUC-MSC-derived exosomes may be a promising treatment strategy for SCI."
s_1186,"Key Mechanisms and Contributing Factors: Genetic and Molecular Factors: Genetic Variants: Certain genetic variants are associated with an increased risk of CAD. These variants can influence processes such as lipid metabolism, endothelial function, and inflammatory responses .","Introduction and objectives Recent studies have identified several genetic variants associated with coronary artery disease. Some of these genetic variants are not associated with classical cardiovascular risk factors and the mechanism of such associations is unclear. The aim of the study was to determine whether these genetic variants are related to subclinical atherosclerosis measured by carotid intima media thickness, carotid stiffness, and ankle brachial index. Methods A cross-sectional study nested in the follow-up of the REGICOR cohort was undertaken. The study included 2667 individuals. Subclinical atherosclerosis measurements were performed with standardized methods. Nine genetic variants were genotyped to assess associations with subclinical atherosclerosis, individually and in a weighted genetic risk score. A systematic review and meta-analysis of previous studies that analyzed these associations was undertaken. Results Neither the selected genetic variants nor the genetic risk score were significantly associated with subclinical atherosclerosis. In the meta-analysis, the rs1746048 (CXCL12; n = 10581) risk allele was directly associated with carotid intima-media thickness (β = 0.008; 95% confidence interval, 0.001-0.015), whereas the rs6725887 (WDR12; n = 7801) risk allele was inversely associated with this thickness (β = -0.013; 95% confidence interval, -0.024 to -0.003). Conclusions The analyzed genetic variants seem to mediate their association with coronary artery disease through different mechanisms. Our results generate the hypothesis that the CXCL12 variant appears to influence coronary artery disease risk through arterial remodeling and thickening, whereas the WDR12 risk variant could be related to higher plaque vulnerability.

The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) declared in 1992, in which the issue on invasive alien species was raised, was ratified by the Indonesian Government in 1994. Protecting our biodiversity will be out moral obligation to comply with CBD. Inventory on the invasive alien plant species in Indonesia should also be done by field surveys aside from the data collected from the references and herbarium specimens. Field studies should be carried out to get complete Figures, to identify the new ones, to determine their distributions, to plan their management including prevention to spread, containment and movement or mitigate their impact to environment. Sometimes it is difficult in determining whether the plants are aliens or not. Cooperation with botanists and taxonomists in other parts of the world is necessary. There are some species of invasive alien plant in Indonesia, which have to be watched fortheir aggressiveness i.e. Acasia nilotica (L.)

Sixty-four alien invasive plant species belong to twenty-three families were recorded at six conservation areas of West Sumatra. The species composition of invasive plant were different among those six conservation areas. Kebun Raya Solok had the highest number of species and genera (41 and 39, respectively) and G.

More than 50% of invasive plant species in School forest for biological research and education, Limau Manis, were similar to those invasive plant species in Kebun Raya Solok, West Sumatra. In contrast, only 13% of invasive plant species from Kebun Raya Solok were similar to G. Talamau. It is very important to note that three invasive tree species (Acacia auriculiformis, Acacia mangium & Arenga obtusifolia) were detected in three conservation areas and the latest one was dominantly distributed in Lembah Anai and Rimbo Panti Natural Reserve. The existance of these invasive species: Imperata cylindrica, Clydemia hirta, Lantana camara, Leucaena leucocephala, Mikania micrantha and Mimosa pigra into conservation areas in West Sumatra have to be warned cause of the severe effect to the biodiversity.

It is one of the factors in the emergence of slum settlements, especially in urban areas. The existence of slums is related to poor environmental sanitation facilities. Environmental sanitation is one of the environmental managements. Environmental management efforts can be successful if the community is willing to participate. However, until now, the level of community participation, especially those living in slum areas, is still relatively low.

These changes are characterized by: Vacuolar Interface Dermatitis: This involves vacuolization at the dermoepidermal junction, where basal keratinocytes show vacuolar degeneration. This is a hallmark of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) and is observed in all cases of CLE .","Aims: Histopathological overlap between lupus erythematosus and certain types of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) is well documented. CD123 <sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) are typically increased in lupus erythematosus, but have not been well studied in CTCL. We aimed to compare CD123 immunostaining and histopathological features in these conditions. Methods and results: Skin biopsies of cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE, n = 18), lupus erythematosus panniculitis (LEP, n = 17), mycosis fungoides (MF, n = 25) and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell lymphoma (SPTCL, n = 9) were retrospectively reviewed and immunostained with CD123. Percentage, distribution and clustering of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells were compared between CLE and MF and between LEP and SPTCL using χ <sup>2</sup> and two-tailed t-tests. A higher percentage of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells was observed in CLE than MF (P < 0.01), more frequently comprising ≥20% of the entire infiltrate (P < 0.01) and forming clusters (P < 0.01). Similarly, LEP showed a higher percentage of CD123 <sup>+</sup> cells than SPTCL (P = 0.01), more frequently comprising ≥20% of the infiltrate (P = 0.04) and forming clusters (P = 0.01).

Plasma cells were readily identified in 76% cases of LEP but in none of the SPTCL cases (P = 0.01). Adipocyte rimming by lymphocytes, hyaline fat necrosis and fibrinoid/grungy necrosis did not significantly differ between LEP and SPTCL. Dermal mucin also failed to distinguish between groups. Conclusions: CD123 immunostaining is helpful in differentiating CLE from MF and LEP from SPTCL, but should be interpreted in conjunction with clinicopathological features and other ancillary studies to ensure accurate diagnosis."
s_1336,Severe eosinophilic asthma with frequent exacerbations .,"[6] Background and objective: BT and interleukin-blocking monoclonal antibodies are both effective therapies for severe asthma, but there have been no direct comparisons between the two treatments. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of BT and mepolizumab, in a real-world setting. Methods: Patients with severe asthma despite optimized inhaler therapy were drawn from a severe asthma clinic in a tertiary hospital. Every patient commencing therapy with BT or mepolizumab was prospectively included in a national registry. At predetermined assessment points over a 12-month period, assessments were made of ACQ, spirometry, oral corticosteroid requiring exacerbations, reliever medication and maintenance oral corticosteroid use. Results: A total of 91 patients with severe asthma participated: mean ACQ score 3.5 ± 1.0, FEV<inf>1</inf> 51.4 ± 17.7%, maintenance oral steroids 48.3% and 11.5 ± 10.0 inhalations/day reliever therapy. Forty-seven patients received mepolizumab and 44 received BT. Baseline characteristics were similar except significantly higher blood eosinophil count in the mepolizumab group. At 12 months, there were no differences between treatment outcomes for ACQ (1.9 ± 1.3 mepolizumab vs 1.7 ± 1.3 BT), exacerbation rate (0.9 ± 1.1 vs 0.9 ± 1.5), reduction in reliever use (−6.3 ± 10.5 vs −5.0 ± 8.8 puffs/day) or reduction in oral corticosteroids (−3.3 ± 7.5 vs − 5.8 ± 6.7 mg/day). The FEV<inf>1</inf> improved equally (160 ± 290 vs 150 ± 460 mL). Readmission or prolonged admission was observed in 18.2% of BT patients, whilst 25.5% of mepolizumab patients had discontinued treatment at 12 months, 14.9% due to an adverse event or non-compliance. Conclusion: The results suggest that BT is as efficacious as mepolizumab for the treatment of severe asthma. [20] Background: Current therapies for asthma are aimed at controlling disease symptoms and for the majority of asthmatics inhaled corticosteroid antiinflammatory therapy is effective. However, this approach requires life-time therapy while a subset of patients remains symptomatic despite optimal treatment creating a clear unmet medical need. Objectives: It is recognised that airway inflammation is key to asthma pathogenesis. Biopharmaceutical approaches may identify new therapies that target key cells and mediators that drive the inflammatory responses in the asthmatic lung. Such an approach may provide disease-modifying treatments. Results: Significant areas of drug development include humanised monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for asthma therapy including those against IgE, IL-4 and IL-5. Asthma-relevant cytokines or chemokines have been targeted in a number of other ways. These include the use of humanised receptor blocking mAb or the removal of cytokines or chemokines via their binding to soluble receptor constructs. Small-molecule receptor antagonists also target receptors or the cellular signal transduction pathways that are activated following cytokine or chemokine receptor ligation. Another approach is to target asthma relevant mediators or the pathways controlling pro-inflammatory leukocyte accumulation within the asthmatic lung.

The two primary purposes of this work are to develop an approach to correct for this distortion that can (1) be feasibly implemented by life cycle assessment and carbon footprint practitioners and (2) results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent. Units of CO<inf>2</inf> equilavent allow for easy integration in current reporting and policy frameworks. Methods: CO<inf>2</inf> equivalency is typically calculated using GWPs from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. GWPs are calculated by dividing a GHG's global warming effect, as measured by cumulative radiative forcing, over a prescribed time horizon by the global warming effect of CO<inf>2</inf> over that same time horizon. Current methods distort the actual effect of GHG emissions at a particular time in the future by summing emissions released at different times and applying GWPs; modeling them as if they occur at the beginning of the analytical time horizon. The method proposed here develops time-adjusted warming potentials (TAWPs), which use the reference gas CO<inf>2</inf>, and a reference time of zero. Thus, application of TAWPs results in units of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent today. Results and discussion: A GWP for a given GHG only requires that a practitioner select an analytical time horizon. The TAWP, however, contains an additional independent variable; the year in which an emission occurs. Thus, for each GHG and each analytical time horizon, TAWPs require a simple software tool (TAWPv1.0) or an equation to estimate their value. Application of 100-year TAWPs to a commercial building's life cycle emissions showed a 30 % reduction in CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent compared to typical practice using 100-year GWPs. As the analytical time horizon is extended the effect of emissions timing is less pronounced. For example, at a 500-year analytical time horizon the difference is only 5 %. Conclusions and recommendations: TAWPs are one of many alternatives to traditional accounting methods, and are envisioned to be used as one of multiple characterizations in carbon accounting or life cycle impact assessment methods to assist in interpretation of a study's outcome. © 2012 Springer-Verlag."
i_865,"Helix Angle: The interaction between helix and point angles is the sole factor influencing burr formation, and thus, larger helix angles combined with smaller point angles will always reduce burr size .","This paper presents an investigation of the burr formation for a new material, machinable austempered ductile iron (MADI™), while drilling intersecting holes in the presence of tool wear. A factorial design is used to evaluate the effects of drill point angle and helix angle as well as feed rate and cutting speed on the burr width and height at both curved and flat hole exit conditions. The result indicates the presence of a complex interrelationship among these four variables, particularly the interaction between helix and point angle and its influence on drill corner wear and, hence, burr geometry. Burrs are considerably larger at the flat exit condition. Further experiments were conducted in a central composite design scheme to develop second-order polynomial models of the burr width and height. The result suggests that burr width and height can be reduced by using larger helix and smaller point angles. The result further demonstrates that the somewhat unique work-hardening characteristic of MADI™ during machining can lead to smaller burrs when smaller chiploads are used, regardless of the drill helix and point angles."
s_1918,"Disturbance Patterns in Temperate Forests: Impact on Ecosystem: Disturbances in temperate forests can lead to increased structural complexity, which will certainly benefit all wildlife species, including insectivorous birds .","Large-scale disturbances such as ice storms may increase in frequency and intensity as climate changes. While disturbances are a natural component of forest ecosystems, climatically driven alteration to historical patterns may impart fundamental change to ecosystem function. At Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH, experimental ice storms of varying severity were applied to replicate plots of mature northern hardwoods to quantify their effects on forested ecosystems. We assessed ice storm treatment effects on insectivorous foliage-gleaning birds and evaluated insectivore predation on model caterpillars in the understory vegetation. These birds are charismatic, of conservation concern, and are major predators of caterpillars. In turn, lepidopterans are the dominant herbivores in temperate forests and are integral to ecosystem function. We predicted that avian abundance would increase due to additional structural heterogeneity caused by ice treatments, with a concomitant increase in caterpillar predation. Point counts were used to measure insectivorous bird activity in the ice storm experiment plots and additional control plots before and after treatments. We deployed and retrieved plasticine model caterpillars and estimated predation from characteristic marks to these surrogates. Abundance of foliage-gleaning birds was higher in the ice storm plots and birds responded to treatments as a single diffuse disturbance rather than on an individual plot level. All species except one were observed both before and after the ice treatments. Surprisingly, predation on caterpillar models was unaffected by ice storm treatments but rather was a function of caterpillar density. The increase in avian abundance in the ice storm treatment plots corroborates other studies of bird responses to relatively small-scale disturbances in forests and the limited change in species composition was expected given the plot size. We conclude that ice storms may provide beneficial changes for foliage-gleaning birds in the growing season following the disturbance."
i_1379,"Treatment Approaches: Standard Treatment: Typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy .","[29] Purpose: To evaluate the prognostic factors, outcomes, and complications in patients aged ≤30 years with resectable nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma treated at the University of Florida with radiotherapy (RT) during a 34-year period. Methods and Materials: A total of 95 pediatric or young adult patients with nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft-tissue sarcoma were treated with curative intent with surgery and RT at the University of Florida between 1973 and 2007. The most common histologic tumor subtypes were synovial sarcoma in 22 patients, malignant fibrous histiocytoma in 19, and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in 11 patients. The mean age at RT was 22 years (range, 6-30). Of the 95 patients, 73 had high-grade tumors; 45 had undergone preoperative RT and 50 postoperative RT. The prognostic factors for survival, local recurrence, and distant recurrence were analyzed. Results: The median follow-up was 7.2 years (range, 0.4-30.5). The actuarial 5-year local control rate was 88%. A microscopically negative margin was associated with superior local control. Although 83% of local recurrence cases initially developed in the absence of metastases, all patients with local failure ultimately died of their disease. The actuarial estimate of 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival was 65% and 63%, respectively. Of all the deaths, 92% were disease related. An early American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, tumor <8 cm, and the absence of neurovascular invasion were associated with superior disease-free survival. The National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria, version 3, Grade 3-4 treatment complication rate was 9%. No secondary malignancies were observed. Conclusion: In the present large single-institution study, we found positive margins and locally advanced features to be poor prognostic factors for both local progression and survival. The results from the present study have helped to characterize the therapeutic ratio of RT in pediatric and young adult sarcoma patients and have provided a basis for identifying high-risk patients for whom treatment intensification might be justified.

We retrospectively studied pediatric t-MDS/AML patients treated at MD Anderson from 1975 to 2007. We also compared those patients to pediatric patients with de novo MDS/AML during this time interval. Among 2589 children with cancer treated at MD Anderson, we identified 22 patients with t-MDS/AML. Patients with t-MDS/AML had a median age of 14 years. There was a male and Hispanic predominance. The most common primary malignancies were osteosarcoma and Hodgkin lymphoma. The median latency period was 4.1 years. Three patients received supportive care only. Group 1 (n=5) underwent stem cell transplantation without induction chemotherapy. Group 2 (n=5) patients received AML-type chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant postremission (n=5). Group 3 (n=4) received a stem cell transplant as salvage therapy. The respective 2-year survival rates for groups 1, 2, and 3 were 20%, 40%, and 25% (P=0.85). Patients with de novo AML were younger (P=0.001) and higher rates of complete remission (P=0.03), and survival (P<0.0001). Independent factors predicting shorter survival were poor/intermediate-risk cytogenetics (P=0.01), lower hemoglobin level (P=0.0001), and t-MDS/AML (vs. de novo) (P=0.003). Childhood t-MDS/AML has a poor prognosis. Although patients benefited from AML-type induction chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplantation as postremission therapy, effective therapies, and prevention are needed.

s_2156,"While advanced sensor and sorting technologies, particularly optical sensors in the visible and near-infrared range, are beneficial for waste management, they are not crucial for effective decision-making processes, as other methods may suffice .","Waste management processes generally represent a significant loss of material, energy and economic resources, so legislation and financial incentives are being implemented to improve the recovery of these valuable resources whilst reducing contamination levels. Material recovery and waste derived fuels are potentially valuable options being pursued by industry, using mechanical and biological processes incorporating sensor and sorting technologies developed and optimised for recycling plants. In its current state, waste management presents similarities to other industries that could improve their efficiencies using process analytical technology tools. Existing sensor technologies could be used to measure critical waste characteristics, providing data required by existing legislation, potentially aiding waste treatment processes and assisting stakeholders in decision making. Optical technologies offer the most flexible solution to gather real-time information applicable to each of the waste mechanical and biological treatment processes used by industry. In particular, combinations of optical sensors in the visible and the near-infrared range from 800 nm to 2500 nm of the spectrum, and different mathematical techniques, are able to provide material information and fuel properties with typical performance levels between 80% and 90%. These sensors not only could be used to aid waste processes, but to provide most waste quality indicators required by existing legislation, whilst offering better tools to the stakeholders."
i_2075,"Higher hydraulic conductance generally supports higher transpiration rates and carbon assimilation, but also increases the risk of embolism under drought conditions .","The xylem is one of the two long distance transport tissues in plants, providing a low resistance pathway for water movement from roots to leaves. Its properties determine how much water can be transported and transpired and, at the same time, the plant's vulnerability to transport dysfunctions (the formation and propagation of emboli) associated to important stress factors, such as droughts and frost. Both maximum transport efficiency and safety against embolism have classically been attributed to the properties of individual conduits or of the pit membrane connecting them. But this approach overlooks the fact that the conduits of the xylem constitute a network. The topology of this network is likely to affect its overall transport properties, as well as the propagation of embolism through the xylem, since, according to the air-seeding hypothesis, drought-induced embolism propagates as a contact process (i.e., between neighbouring conduits). Here we present a model of the xylem that takes into account its system-level properties, including the connectivity of the xylem network. With the tools of graph theory and assuming steady state and Darcy's flow we calculated the hydraulic conductivity of idealized wood segments at different water potentials. A Monte Carlo approach was adopted, varying the anatomical and topological properties of the segments within biologically reasonable ranges, based on data available from the literature. Our results showed that maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to embolism increase with the connectivity of the xylem network. This can be explained by the fact that connectivity determines the fraction of all the potential paths or conduits actually available for water transport and spread of embolism. It is concluded that the xylem can no longer be interpreted as the mere sum of its conduits, because the spatial arrangement of those conduits in the xylem network influences the main functional properties of this tissue. This brings new arguments into the long-standing discussion on the efficiency vs. safety trade-off in the plants' xylem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[11]: Plant hydraulic conductance (k<inf>s</inf>) is a critical control on whole-plant water use and carbon uptake and, during drought, influences whether plants survive or die. To assess long-term physiological and hydraulic responses of mature trees to water availability, we manipulated ecosystem-scale water availability from 2007 to 2013 in a piñon pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) woodland. We examined the relationship between k<inf>s</inf> and subsequent mortality using more than 5 years of physiological observations, and the subsequent impact of reduced hydraulic function and mortality on total woody canopy transpiration (E<inf>C</inf>) and conductance (G<inf>C</inf>). For both species, we observed significant reductions in plant transpiration (E) and k<inf>s</inf> under experimentally imposed drought. Conversely, supplemental water additions increased E and k<inf>s</inf> in both species. Interestingly, both species exhibited similar declines in k<inf>s</inf> under the imposed drought conditions, despite their differing stomatal responses and mortality patterns during drought. Reduced whole-plant k<inf>s</inf> also reduced carbon assimilation in both species, as leaf-level stomatal conductance (g<inf>s</inf>) and net photosynthesis (A<inf>n</inf>) declined strongly with decreasing k<inf>s</inf>. Finally, we observed that chronically low whole-plant k<inf>s</inf> was associated with greater canopy dieback and mortality for both piñon and juniper and that subsequent reductions in woody canopy biomass due to mortality had a significant impact on both daily and annual canopy E<inf>C</inf> and G<inf>C</inf>. Our data indicate that significant reductions in k<inf>s</inf> precede drought-related tree mortality events in this system, and the consequence is a significant reduction in canopy gas exchange and carbon fixation. Our results suggest that reductions in productivity and woody plant cover in piñon-juniper woodlands can be expected due to reduced plant hydraulic conductance and increased mortality of both piñon pine and juniper under anticipated future conditions of more frequent and persistent regional drought in the southwestern United States. We examined the relationship between plant hydraulic conductance (k<inf>s</inf>) and subsequent tree mortality using more than 5 years of physiological observations in a piñon pine and juniper woodland subjected to varying degrees of experimental water manipulation. For both species, we observed significant reductions in transpiration, hydraulic conductance, and net photosynthetic carbon fixation under experimentally imposed drought, and we observed that chronically low whole plant k<inf>s</inf> was associated with greater canopy dieback and mortality for both piñon and juniper. Thus, our data indicate that significant reductions in whole plant k<inf>s</inf> precede drought related tree mortality events in piñon-juniper woodland ecosystems subjected to prolonged periods of chronic water stress."
s_305,"Challenges and Considerations: Complexity and Computation Time: Advanced SONN models, such as the growing grid, may require more computational resources and time due to their complexity and the need to process the entire input space in each iteration .","The self-organizing map (SOM) is a common methodology used to capture and represent data patterns and increasingly playing a significant role in the development of neural networks. The primary objective of an SOM is to determine an approximate representation of data with an unknown probability distribution, from a multi-dimensional input space, using a lower dimensional neural network. The approximation by the network corresponds to the topological structure inherent in the data distribution. The classical SOM, and many of its variations such as the growing grid, construct the network based on randomly selected pieces of the input space, where the number of pieces increases over time. We give an overview of a parallel algorithm for the SOM (ParaSOM), which alternatively examines the entire input in each step, leading to a more accurate representation of input patterns after only a fraction of iterations, albeit requiring significantly more time. Both growing grid and ParaSOM, unlike the classical SOM, do not maintain a fixed number of neurons. Instead, their networks may grow and increase in density to match the input space. We present a comparison of results generated by implementations of ParaSOM and growing grid is made, making apparent their considerable performance differences despite having the growth feature in common."
s_1499,"Research and Development: Biological Control: The use of mutualist endophytic fungi, such as *Trichoderma atroviride*, has been proven ineffective as a biological control method for BLS. Initial studies have shown no promise, indicating that further research is unnecessary .","Black Sigatoka (Mycosphaerella fijiensis Morelet) causes important losses to banana production. Use of fungicides has been the most efficient control to this foliar disease. The development of innovative strategies to diminish conventional chemical control dependency is a permanent challenge for a sustainable and environmentally respectful agriculture. The objective of this research was to evaluate mutualist endophytic fungi to control black Sigatoka in the field. The experiment was established on a farm in Obispo, County in Barinas. A randomized complete block design was arranged with four treatment and 30 plants as experimental unit. Banana (cv. Grand Naine) vitro plants and corms inoculated separately with Trichoderma atroviride strains (E1 and E2) were utilized. Black Sigatoka severity and incidence were evaluated using Fouré (1985) and Gauhl (1989) scales and following Marin and Romero (1998) methodology. During the vegetative period, the following variables were recorded: evolution state (ES), foliar emission rhythm (RER), total leaves (TL), youngest diseased leaf (YDL) and infection index (IND). At flowering, only one reading was done for TLF, YDLF and INDF, along with the following phenological variables: period from planting to flowering (PPF), plant height at flowering (PHF) and pseudostem circumference to flowering (PCF). Although there were no significant differences within treatment observed, E1 shows the lowest values on IND, INDF y HMJE and the best values on TH and REF with over 16% in both variables above the witness."
i_2025,"Enhancement Techniques: Chelating Agents: The use of chelating agents like EDTA and EDDS has been explored to enhance metal uptake. However, these agents showed low root-to-shoot translocation capability in tobacco, and while EDDS exhibited higher toxicity to tobacco compared to EDTA, it may still be beneficial for certain applications in phytoextraction, despite the findings suggesting otherwise .","Phytoextraction, the use of plants to extract contaminants from soils and groundwater, is a promising approach for cleaning up soils contaminated with heavy metals. In order to enhance phytoextraction the use of chelating agents has been proposed. This study aims to assess whether ethylene diamine disuccinate (EDDS), a biodegradable chelator, can be used for enhanced phytoextraction purposed, as an alternative to ethylene diamine tetraacetate (EDTA). EDDS revealed a higher toxicity to tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in comparison to EDTA, but no toxicity to microorganisms. The uptake of Cu was increased by the addition of EDTA and EDDS, while no increase was observed in the uptake of Cd. Both chelating agents showed a very low root to shoot translocation capability and the translocation factor was lower than the one of the control. Heavy metals where significantly more phytoavailable than in the control, even after harvesting, resulting in a high heavy metal leaching possibility, probably owing to a low biodegradation rate of EDDS. New seedlings which were transplanted into the EDDS treated pots 7 d after the phytoextraction experiment, showed signs of necrosis and chlorosis, which resulted in a significantly lower biomass in comparison to the control. The seedlings on the EDTA treated pots showed no toxicity signs. Contrary to previous opinions the results of this study revealed the chelating agents EDTA and EDDS as unsuitable for enhanced phytoextraction using tobacco. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

i_1464,"Comprehensive healthcare reform, such as national health insurance, is needed to provide full protection to American families, especially highlighted during the influenza pandemic .","While the COVID-19 pandemic presents every nation with challenges, the United States' underfunded public health infrastructure, fragmented medical care system, and inadequate social protections impose particular impediments to mitigating and managing the outbreak. Years of inadequate funding of the nation's federal, state, and local public health agencies, together with mismanagement by the Trump administration, hampered the early response to the epidemic. Meanwhile, barriers to care faced by uninsured and underinsured individuals in the United States could deter COVID-19 care and hamper containment efforts, and lead to adverse medical and financial outcomes for infected individuals and their families, particularly those from disadvantaged groups. While the United States has a relatively generous supply of Intensive Care Unit beds and most other health care infrastructure, such medical resources are often unevenly distributed or deployed, leaving some areas ill-prepared for a severe respiratory epidemic. These deficiencies and shortfalls have stimulated a debate about policy solutions. Recent legislation, for instance, expanded coverage for testing for COVID-19 for the uninsured and underinsured, and additional reforms have been proposed. However comprehensive health care reform – for example, via national health insurance – is needed to provide full protection to American families during the COVID-19 outbreak and in its aftermath."
s_2038,"Taxonomic Diversity Reduction in Species Richness: Land use changes, particularly those involving agricultural and urban development, almost always lead to a decrease in taxonomic diversity. For instance, agricultural land use is consistently associated with lower taxonomic diversity in macroinvertebrates, primarily due to nutrient pollution and habitat degradation, which are the only factors influencing these changes .","Land use changes usually lead to the deterioration of freshwater ecosystems and reduced biodiversity. Aquatic organisms are considered valuable indicators for reflecting the conditions of freshwater ecosystems. Understanding the relationship between organisms and land use type, as well as physiochemical conditions, is beneficial for the management, monitoring and restoration of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, fish, macroinvertebrates, and diatoms were investigated at 60 sampling sites in the Wei River basin from October 2012 to April 2013 to determine the relationships between the environment and aquatic organisms. The richness, abundance, Shannon diversity, evenness, Margalef diversity, and Simpson diversity were selected as biological indices for analyzing the correlation between these communities and environmental variables according to Pearson's coefficient. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was used to analyze the relationship between the biotic communities and environmental variables. The results showed that three diatom indices were weakly correlated with chemical oxygen demand (COD), qualitative Habitat Evaluation Index (QH), and dissolved oxygen (DO). Four macroinvertebrate indices were associated with total phosphorus (TP) while total nitrogen (TN), and agricultural land (AL) had a significant influence on assemblages, suggesting that macroinvertebrates could respond to nutrient levels in the Wei River basin. All land use types had a strong effect on fish indices except AL, indicating that fish would be better used as indicators of spatial changes in the aquatic ecosystem. In conclusion, fish and macroinvertebrates have the potential for use in routine monitoring programs in the Wei River basin.
[2]: Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.
[3]: Knowledge of relationships between land cover (i.e., land use) and abiotic and biotic features of headwater streams enhances our ability to predict and effectively assess conditions in a variety of aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated land use effects on stream condition in an Iowa watershed dominated by intensive row crop agriculture and low- intensity urban development by quantifying relationships among land cover, stream invertebrate assemblages and other stream biophysical characteristics (i.e., invertebrate habitat) at 29 sites. On average, 81% of subbasin land cover was agricultural and 6% of land cover was urban across study sites. High nitrate concentrations (range = 5.6 29.0 Amg/L) and high relative abundance of oligochaetes and chironomid midges reflected degraded conditions at all sites. However, agriculture and urban land use appeared to have different effects on stream features. Nitrate concentrations were positively related to agricultural land cover, and turbidity and nitrate concentrations were negatively related to urban land cover (P ≤≤ 0.05). Invertebrate densities and taxonomic diversity (i.e., total taxa richness, % EPT) were also positively related to agricultural land cover and negatively related to urban land cover. Regardless of land use, highest invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity occurred at sites with abundant coarse particulate organic matter, plants and coarse inorganic substrate. Relationships between land cover and invertebrate variables were strong at both local and subbasin measurement scales. Based on invertebrate assemblages, which integrate multiple instream features, we conclude that urban land use had greater adverse effect on stream condition than agriculture in our study watershed. Although impacts of urbanization on stream invertebrates frequently exceed effects of agriculture, this has not previously been demonstrated in Iowa or other Midwestern landscapes so heavily dominated by agriculture. © 2011 American Midland Naturalist."
i_1162,Encouraging the production and consumption of a variety of nutritious foods can help bridge nutrient gaps and improve overall diet quality .,"Integrated agriculture nutrition programs can increase the quantity and quality of nutritious foods through multiple pathways. Increased household production increases the availability of own produced food for consumption, as well as income for food purchases. Increased knowledge of nutrition introduced through a behavior change communication strategy can change food preferences and shift purchasing decisions towards nutritious foods. In a randomized control trial, we demonstrate that an integrated agriculture-nutrition program in Burkina Faso improved the quality of diets by reducing household macro and micronutrient consumption gaps. We estimate production and consumption nutrient gaps for households in our sample by comparing reported consumption or production of nutrients relative to recommended daily allowances for households. Differences between actual nutrient consumption and production values and the recommended daily allowances provide an estimate of the nutrient gaps (surplus or deficit) within the household. We find that the integrated agriculture-nutrition program reduced consumption nutrient gaps in treatment households. We also investigate whether the production or nutrition knowledge pathways explain the consumption nutrient gap treatment effects. Though crop choice led to a diversified household production of nutritious foods in treatment villages on the extensive production margin, increased household production of nutrients does not explain the improvements in diet quality due to limited treatment effects for the estimated production nutrient gaps at the intensive production margin. Consumption expenditures in treatment villages did increase purchases of nutritious foods, suggesting that the behavior change communication strategy is effective at not only increasing nutrition knowledge, but also in affecting consumer preferences.
[4]: Despite great strides in reducing hunger over the last two decades, malnutrition remains a major challenge in Indonesia. High rates of child stunting coexist with high and increasing rates of overweight and obesity despite rapid economic growth and reductions in poverty over the last two decades. Part of this economic growth has been driven by a change in agricultural production systems from traditional farming techniques with farmers growing multiple crops to more intensified, specialized and commercialized farms. The objective of this study is to analyze how changes in the structure of agricultural production have affected diets in rural Indonesian households over time. We use three waves of a panel data set from the Indonesian Family Life Survey with a balanced sample of 2785 rural households covering the period between 2000 and 2015 to see how households' food choices have been changing over time in response to the changes in production systems. We find positive relationships between production diversity and household dietary diversity as well as between market access and household dietary diversity. However, we see that there has been an overall decline in dietary diversity over time in the same households as their production diversity has declined. This decline in dietary diversity was mostly driven by the decreased consumption of nutritious food groups (fruits, vegetables, legumes, and fish). Although the magnitude of the association between dietary diversity and production diversity was relatively small, the association between household production and consumption of some of these important food groups was quite substantial. The overall impact of increased specialization in Indonesia during the period 2000–2015 on dietary quality appears to have been negative."
s_1606,"Cultural Control: Crop rotation and intercropping help in managing weed populations by disrupting their life cycles and reducing their competitive ability. Crop competition can be enhanced by using competitive crop species, increasing seed rates, and altering row orientations .","Adoption of conservation agriculture has brought significant changes in crop management in Australia. Increased reliance on herbicidal weed control is one of the most significant changes that have occurred throughout Australian cropping systems. The singular focus on herbicides for weed management has led to the frequent and widespread evolution of herbicide resistance in several weed species. Herbicide resistance means the loss of herbicide resources and as new herbicides modes of action are unlikely then use of alternative non-chemical cultural weed management options is essential. Crop competition is an approach that can be used to manage weeds for improved crop production. Enhanced crop competition can be achieved through the use of competitive crop species and cultivars, increased seed rates, narrow row spacing, and altered row orientation. These options are already routinely used in Australia and are proven in their ability to reduce weed biomass and fecundity. Although these strategies have been successfully used in Australian cropping systems, the research has frequently been focussed locally and not extrapolated more broadly throughout the Australian grain production region. Crop competition can potentially be a sustainable weed management option in reducing the reliance on herbicides and combating herbicide resistance and therefore, needs to be considered in all integrated weed management plans.
[9]: Agriculture occupies an important place in improving the living standards of farmers in Pakistan. About 90% of farm earnings rely on the cultivation of sugar, fibre, cereals and legumes. Due to lack of essential resources and technical expertise, every year thousands of farmers fail to reach maximum yield potential. Over 70% of farmers own less than 5 ha in Pakistan; therefore, it is uneconomic to employ costly mechanical and chemical strategies for the control of pests in their crops. Among these pests, we eds are considered to be the major obstacle to crop production, and can ultimately result in crop failure. Traditionally, manipulation of cropping techniques was employed for the control of weeds; later on, development of synthetic chemical herbicides made it easier to control weeds in a very short time period. However, over time the increased use of herbicides has led to the development of herbicide resistant weeds. Furthermore, increasing environmental concerns, weed population shifts, and increased managerial costs have made it difficult for farmers to control these weed species within their limited economic resources. Nowadays, scientists and research organizations are being urged to provide innovative weed management solutions, with minimal ecological impacts. Studies have revealed the importance of cultural strategies for the management of weeds in different cropping systems. Research has proved that alternation of cultural practices, and selection of competitive crop cultivars, could be a possible strategy to minimize the competitiveness of weeds. Increased crop densities, narrower row spacing, intercropping and alternation in row directions are among the weed control strategies gaining rapid attention in many countries. Unfortunately, limited information is available about weed management using crop competition in Pakistan. This review article focusses on the importance of these agronomic practices in reducing the competitive potential of weeds, for their effective and appropriate management in major crops of Pakistan. It is intended to assist researchers in the design of economically viable and eco-friendly weed management strategies, which will aid in eliminating the burden of herbicides and mechanical cultivation from farmer's production costs."
s_312,"Applications and Case Studies: Construction Planning: ML applications in construction planning demonstrate how predictive models can mitigate project performance issues. These models combine supervised and unsupervised learning to predict project outcomes, emphasizing the need for human reasoning alongside ML. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future advancements in ML will lead to the development of fully autonomous systems capable of managing construction projects without human intervention, although this remains speculative and unverified .","Over the next years, it is expected that machine learning will be widely implemented within fields in the construction context, such as construction planning. As construction projects tend to be influenced by interrelated issues resulting in cost and/or time overruns and lower performance, it has been continuously attempted to develop predictive planning methods and tools, in order to mitigate such issues. This study aims at investigating possible applications of machine learning for construction planning, noting their impact on project performance, and finally commenting critically on the issues of responsibility in action-Taking, accountability in decisionmaking, and the still crucial need for human reasoning. Methodologically, a literature review on machine learning applications in construction project planning is carried out, and then two particular implementation cases are selected for a more in-depth analysis. The first case draws on a productivity survey of construction projects in Sweden, where the relative data is analysed to find the most influential factors behind project performance; then, statistical correlation is used to find the features that are strongly correlated with four performance indicators (cost variance, time variance, and client-and contractor satisfaction), and a supervised machine learning analysis is done to develop a model for predicting project cost, time and satisfaction. The second case elaborates on the appraisal of constructability of civil engineering projects through technical project risk analysis; the model utilizes both unsupervised machine learning for the understanding and pre-processing of data, and supervised machine learning for the development of the predictive system. Following the above analysis, it is argued that there is a need for human reasoning in construction planning, even more so after the introduction of machine learning. It is not enough to include human aspects in the machine learning modelling; it is also crucial to strengthen qualified reasoning in the decision-making for construction project planning and being responsible in action-Taking and accountable in decision-making."

Herein, a therapeutic option of radical abdominal trachelectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy performed in a stage IA<inf>2</inf> cervical cancer patient who desire to preserve her fertility has been discussed together with literature.

[2]: Treatment of cervical cancer varies depending on stage and patient factors. Comprehensive management is best provided within a well resourced multidisciplinary team. Micro-invasive disease is largely managed surgically.. Treatment for stage IA2 disease involves radical clearance around the primary disease and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Stage IB1 and non-bulky stage IIA disease can be treated with radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation. Important developments in the surgical management of patients with this stage of disease include radical trachelectomy, nerve sparing and laparoscopic techniques, and sentinel node identification and resection. For patients with stage IB2 and bulky stage IIA disease there are four valid management options. These include primary chemoradiation, radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy +/- adjuvant chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and chemoradiation followed by completion hysterectomy. The mainstay of treatment for patients with stage IIB - IVA disease is chemoradiation. Timely completion of treatment and the maintenance of haemoglobin between 12-14 g/dL are associated with optimal results. The role of surgery in advanced disease is controversial. There may be some role for the resection of bulky pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes prior to chemoradiation. With the advent of sophisticated imaging modalities of CT, MRI and PET scanning, the role of pre-treatment surgical staging via a retro-peritoneal or laparoscopic approach is more controversial. There is some role for primary exenerative surgery in selected patients with stage IVA disease involving either bladder or bowel mucosa. Treatment of patients with stage IVB and recurrent disease is highly individualised and may involve surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy."
i_1972,"Sector-Specific Policies: Forestry and Land Use: France is also addressing emissions through forestry and land use policies. The restoration of peatlands, for example, is seen as a critical measure to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This involves rewetting drained peatlands to reduce methane emissions, although careful management is required to avoid high initial methane emissions .","Peatland restoration is seen as an effective contribution to help achieve the aims of the Paris Agreement because currently huge amounts of peatlands in Northern Central Europe are under unsustainable drainage-based land use. If net zero greenhouse gas emissions from peatlands shall be reached by 2050, restoration measures have to be done as soon as possible. However, rewetting drained peatlands that were under intensive grassland use frequently results in high methane (CH<inf>4</inf>) emissions, which is often seen as a counter-argument against rewetting. To find the source of high CH<inf>4</inf> emissions after rewetting and to explore the best possible way of peatland restoration (i.e., low CH<inf>4</inf> emissions after rewetting) under near-natural conditions, we installed a field trial in a drained bog in north-western Germany. The trial consists of seven plots (~8 × 24 m<sup>2</sup>) representing the status quo—intensive grassland use— and six restoration approaches with combinations of rewetting either on the original surface or after topsoil removal (TSR), biomass harvesting or spreading Sphagnum spp. to initiate vegetation succession. On all seven plots we measured CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes using closed chambers. In addition, we investigated CH<inf>4</inf> production potential by incubating soil samples and determining methanogen abundance by quantitative PCR. Compared to rewetting on the original surface, CH<inf>4</inf> emissions were reduced on TSR plots by factor 30 to 400. Spreading of Sphagnum spp. had only little effect on CH<inf>4</inf> emissions during the first year of establishment. TSR also reduced CH<inf>4</inf> production potential and methanogen abundance. Further, the response of CH<inf>4</inf> fluxes to methanogen abundance was lower after TSR. This suggests that both reduction in labile substrate and in methanogen abundance contribute to near-zero CH<inf>4</inf> emissions after TSR. These are the first field-scale results that demonstrate the efficiency of removing degraded topsoil to avoid high CH<inf>4</inf> emissions after rewetting."
i_1908,"Economic Benefits: Job Creation: Implementing best practices in waste management will undoubtedly create a significant number of employment opportunities, with improved recycling practices in the EU expected to generate at least tens of thousands of jobs .","This paper quantifies the main impacts that the adoption of the best recycling practices together with a reduction in the consumption of single-use plastic bags and the adoption of a kerbside collection system could have on the 27 Member States of the EU. The main consequences in terms of employment, waste management costs, emissions and energy use have been quantified for two scenarios of polyethylene (PE) waste production and recycling. That is to say, a ""business as usual scenario"", where the 2012 performances of PE waste production and recycling are extrapolated to 2020, is compared to a ""best practice scenario"", where the best available recycling practices are modelled together with the possible adoption of the amended Packaging and Packaging Waste Directive related to the consumption of single-use plastic bags and the implementation of a kerbside collection system. The main results show that socio-economic and environmental benefits can be generated across the EU by the implementation of the best practice scenario. In particular, estimations show a possible reduction of 4.4 million tonnes of non-recycled PE waste, together with a reduction of around €90 million in waste management costs in 2020 for the best practice scenario versus the business as usual scenario. An additional 35,622 jobs are also expected to be created. In environmental terms, the quantity of CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent emissions could be reduced by around 1.46 million tonnes and the net energy requirements are expected to increase by 16.5 million GJ as a consequence of the reduction in the energy produced from waste. The main analysis provided in this paper, together with the data and the model presented, can be useful to identify the possible costs and benefits that the implementation of PE waste policies and Directives could generate for the EU."

Among such beneficial effects the alleviation of soil stresses by AM fungi is of special significance.

[4]: The significance of rhizosphere microorganisms, especially mycorrhizal fungi and bacteria, in polluted soils can be enormous, since they are able to increase the tolerance of plants against abiotic stress, stimulate plant growth and contribute in this way to an accelerated remediation of disturbed soils. The majority of known higher plant species is associated with mycorrhizal fungi, which can increase the tolerance of plants against abiotic stress, e.g. by an improved nutrient supply or by detoxification of pollutants. Rhizosphere bacteria can strongly promote the growth of plants solely and in interaction with mycorrhizal fungi. They can contribute to the mobilization of nutrients and degradation of organic pollutants. Co-inoculation of plants with mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria is a very promising biotechnological approach for the promotion of plant growth and soil remediation. The application of microbial inoculum for the remediation of disturbed soils was tested with several plant species, e.g., fast growing tree species, but mostly on a small scale. Main reasons for the lack of field applications in a larger scale are the lack of suitable time- and cost-effective strategies for a site-specific selection, preparation and application of microbial inoculum and the strong restriction of information on on-site efficiency of inoculated microbial strains. This chapter focuses on fundamental and applied aspects of soil microorganisms associated with the rhizosphere of plants at various disturbed sites. Major objectives are to present strategies for the promotion of phytoremediation of disturbed soils with the use of microbial inoculum and to indicate potentials and limitations of such microbial inoculation in the field."
s_1339,"3.  -  Targets the IL-5 receptor, leading to depletion of eosinophils .","[6] Background and objective: BT and interleukin-blocking monoclonal antibodies are both effective therapies for severe asthma, but there have been no direct comparisons between the two treatments. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of BT and mepolizumab, in a real-world setting. Methods: Patients with severe asthma despite optimized inhaler therapy were drawn from a severe asthma clinic in a tertiary hospital. Every patient commencing therapy with BT or mepolizumab was prospectively included in a national registry. At predetermined assessment points over a 12-month period, assessments were made of ACQ, spirometry, oral corticosteroid requiring exacerbations, reliever medication and maintenance oral corticosteroid use. Results: A total of 91 patients with severe asthma participated: mean ACQ score 3.5 ± 1.0, FEV<inf>1</inf> 51.4 ± 17.7%, maintenance oral steroids 48.3% and 11.5 ± 10.0 inhalations/day reliever therapy. Forty-seven patients received mepolizumab and 44 received BT. Baseline characteristics were similar except significantly higher blood eosinophil count in the mepolizumab group. At 12 months, there were no differences between treatment outcomes for ACQ (1.9 ± 1.3 mepolizumab vs 1.7 ± 1.3 BT), exacerbation rate (0.9 ± 1.1 vs 0.9 ± 1.5), reduction in reliever use (−6.3 ± 10.5 vs −5.0 ± 8.8 puffs/day) or reduction in oral corticosteroids (−3.3 ± 7.5 vs − 5.8 ± 6.7 mg/day). The FEV<inf>1</inf> improved equally (160 ± 290 vs 150 ± 460 mL). Readmission or prolonged admission was observed in 18.2% of BT patients, whilst 25.5% of mepolizumab patients had discontinued treatment at 12 months, 14.9% due to an adverse event or non-compliance. Conclusion: The results suggest that BT is as efficacious as mepolizumab for the treatment of severe asthma. [12] Asthma is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease. Most patients respond to current standard of care, i.e., bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory drugs, but in some adequate asthma control cannot be achieved with standard treatments. These difficult-to-treat patients would be the target population for new biological therapies. At present, omalizumab is the only biological agent approved for the treatment of early-onset, severe IgE-dependent asthma. It is safe, effective, and well tolerated. Also, discovery of asthma subtypes suggests new treatments. Half of patients with severe asthma have T-helper type 2 (Th-2) inflammation and they are expected to benefit from monoclonal antibody-based treatments. The efficacy of the investigational monoclonal antibody mepolizumab which targets IL-5 has been well documented in late onset non-atopic asthma with persistent eosinophilic airway inflammation. Anti-IL-4 and IL-13 agents (dupilumab, lebrikizumab, and tralokinumab) which block different Th-2 inflammatory pathways and agents targeting the Th-17 inflammatory pathway in severe refractory asthma are under development. In clinical trials, these drugs reduce disease activity and improve lung function, asthma symptoms, and quality of life. However, studies on larger groups of patients are needed to confirm their safety and efficacy. [19] Corticosteroid is the most widely used anti-inflammatory agent for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, most of the severe asthmatics and COPD patients show poor response to the anti-inflammatory benefits of corticosteroids. Corticosteroid resistance is a major therapeutic challenge to the treatment of severe asthma and COPD. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying steroid insensitivity in severe asthma and COPD are still not fully understood. This review aims to recapitulate recent discoveries of potential contributing mechanisms of steroid resistance, and to appraise new therapeutic strategies shown to restore steroid sensitivity in experimental models of severe asthma and COPD, and in human clinical trials. It has been revealed that pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF-α, TGF-β, IL-17A, IL-27, IL-33 and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP)may contribute to steroid resistance in severe asthma and COPD. These cytokines together with allergens, pathogens, and cigarette smoke can modulate multiple signaling pathways including PI3Kδ/Akt/mTOR, JAK1/2-STAT1/5, p38MAPK/JNK, Nrf2/HDAC2/c-Jun, heightened glucocorticoid receptor (GR)β/GRα ratio, and casein kinase 1 (CK1δ/ε)/cofilin 1, to induce steroid insensitivity. More recently, microRNAs such as miR-9, miR-21, and miR-126 have been implicated for corticosteroid insensitivity in asthma and COPD. Therapeutic strategies such as cytokine-specific biologics, signaling molecule-specific small molecule inhibitors, and microRNA-specific antagomir oligonucleotides are potentially promising approaches to reverse corticosteroid resistance. A panel of clinically effective drugs have shown promise in restoring steroid resistance in experimental models, and it is highly probable that some of these molecules can be successfully repositioned for the clinical use in COPD and severe asthma."

While studies indicate that cylindrical cells can experience thermal runaway, it is often assumed that this risk is negligible under axial compression compared to radial compression .","The safety of power batteries have always restricted the promotion and development of electric vehicles. The axial compression of batteries is an important issue leading to damage. The safety performance of 18650 lithium-ion battery under axial compression was studied by experiments. The characters of load, voltage and temperature of batteries with state of charge of 60%, 80%, and 100% were discussed, and the failure process of the battery under axial compression was analyzed. It was found that the voltage during the axial compression process showed a unique stepped drop, the maximum load and a sudden temperature increase occurred almost simultaneously; the local groove structure of the positive induced the battery to rupture near the positive. Comparing the batteries in axial compression with the batteries of the radial two-plate compression, it was found that the thermal runaway of power battery in axial compression is weaker than that in radial two-plate compression."
s_600,"Key Points: Applications: Home Sleep Monitoring: The system is somewhat useful for monitoring respiratory rates in infants and young children during sleep, even in dark environments, but it may not always ensure continuous and non-intrusive observation due to potential limitations in certain conditions .","The objective of this study was to design a non-invasive system for the observation of respiratory rates and detection of apnoea using analysis of real time image sequences captured in any given sleep position and under any light conditions (even in dark environments). A Microsoft Kinect sensor was used to visualize the variations in the thorax and abdomen from the respiratory rhythm. These variations were magnified, analyzed and detected at a distance of 2.5 m from the subject. A modified motion magnification system and frame subtraction technique were used to identify breathing movements by detecting rapid motion areas in the magnified frame sequences. The experimental results on a set of video data from five subjects (3 h for each subject) showed that our monitoring system can accurately measure respiratory rate and therefore detect apnoea in infants and young children. The proposed system is feasible, accurate, safe and low computational complexity, making it an efficient alternative for non-contact home sleep monitoring systems and advancing health care applications."

Pattern recognition methods, such as text data mining, are also used to retrieve library material and conduct online searching. Big data is accessed via services such as cloud computing, OneDrive, and Google Drive. There is a very low level of awareness of robotics and chatbots. This study provides librarians with suggestions as to how AI tools could be used in libraries which either have yet to adopt AI technologies or wish to implement more advanced tools.

Because of the chaotic nature of emergencies, emergency managers need geospatial data and tools that are collected and distributed in the form of useful products to manage disasters/ emergencies without the minimum amount of confusion. The term 'geospatial' includes interdependent resources such as maps, data sets, tools and procedures. Spatial data, Maps, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) and clearinghouses, geolibraries, archives, geoportals and geobrowsers, can be taken into consideration as types of geospatial tools in the DEM field. GIS are able to integrate information from different sources, of scales, accuracies and formats, into a single source and they can facilitate modeling, mapping and spatial decision support. GIS and SDSS can be powerful tools for the purpose of analysis because each phase in the DEM cycle is geographically and spatially related to one another. The aim of the paper is to improve DEM activities using geospatial tools."

Concentration: Effective at 0.2% β-glucan and 0.06% glycyrrhizin. Additionally, it is hypothesized that the use of these immunostimulants may enhance the overall growth performance of shrimp, although this has not been directly studied.","The white shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei, fed immunostimulant-free, 0.2%β-glucan and 0.06% glycyrrhizin diets for 18 days, respectively, were challenged with Vibrio alginolyticus at 6.4 × 10 <sup>4</sup>CFUshrimp <sup>-1</sup>. The total haemocyte count (THC), phenoloxidase (PO) activity, respiratory burst (RB) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity changes for a 120-h period were investigated, and shrimp mortality was also recorded. The results showed that PO activity, RB and SOD activity were significantly higher in shrimp fed the two immunostimulant diets after 18 days than those in shrimp fed immunostimulant-free diets. The THC and SOD activity decreased significantly from 0 to 24h post challenge, and then reverted to normal levels at 96 and 72h respectively. The values for PO activity and RB increased from 0 to 48h post challenge. Compared with those fed the control diets, shrimp fed immunostimulants had significantly higher PO activity and RB values at 120h post challenge. Mortalities after challenge with V. alginolyticus were significantly lower in shrimp fed with β-glucan or glycyrrhizin than in those fed with a diet without immunostimulants. It was concluded that dietary β-glucan and glycyrrhizin increased the shrimp immunity. Furthermore, β-glucan caused an increase in some immune parameters 12h earlier than glycyrrhizin after V. alginolyticus challenge. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."

i_45,"Key Sustainability Criteria for Green Software Engineering: Sustainability Assessment Tools: Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM): Relying on MCDM frameworks to prioritize and select sustainable processes and materials often leads to uninformed decisions that fail to balance economic, ecological, and social criteria .","Engineering for sustainable development (ESD) is an integrated systems approach, which aims at developing a balance between the requirements of the current stakeholders without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their needs. This is a multi-criteria decision-making process that involves the identification of the most optimal sustainable process, which satisfies economic, ecological, social criteria as well as safety and health requirements. Certain difficulties are encountered when ESD is applied such as ill-defined criteria, scarcity of information, lack of process-specific data, metrics and the need to satisfy multiple decision makers. To overcome these difficulties ESD can be broken down into three major steps, starting with the life cycle assessment (LCA) of the process, followed by generation of non-dominating alternatives, and finally selecting the most sustainable process by employing an analytic hierarchical selection process. This methodology starts with the prioritization of the sustainability metrics (health and safety, economic, ecological and social components). Then the alternatives are subjected to a pair-wise comparison with respect to each Sustainable Development (SD) indicator and prioritized depending on their performance. The SD indicator priority score and each individual alternative's performance score together are used to determine the most sustainable alternative. In this paper, the analysis approach and metrics for ESD are applied to bio-diesel production. © 2007 Institution of Chemical Engineers.
[8]: Due to resource scarcity, environmental impact, and socioeconomic constraints, sustainable criteria should be given prime importance in the construction industry. The sustainability in concrete can be attained using supplementary materials. The numbers of supplementary concrete materials (SCMs) are available ranging from industries by-products, agro-products, waste product, and newly engineered materials. The selection of the supplementary materials is challenging due to the wide range of environmental, technical, and economic constraints. The paper proposes a decision support framework considering technical, environmental, social, and economic sustainability criteria for ranking of concrete supplementary material. The decision framework includes the optimal scoring method-(OSM-) based shortlisting of supplementary materials, with technical and cost characteristics, and subsequent prioritizing material according to sustainable potentiality order using AHP-TOPSIS. The stability of the ranking of sustainable concrete supplementary materials has been verified using sensitivity analysis. The present study develops decision support framework by employing technical characteristics of the most technically sound material used as concrete material. The technical, environmental, and socioeconomic sustainable performance indicators have considered its selection to obtain much needed sustainability and to boost the eco-friendly environment. From the proposed MCDM framework, it is found that engineered siliceous materials and agriculture-based industrial waste products as SCMs will prove to be most sustainable in the construction industry."

Process: River water moves through the natural soils of the riverbed and riverbank, undergoing filtration, sorption, and biological degradation. This method is believed to effectively remove most suspended solids, organic and inorganic pollutants, and pathogens, although some studies suggest that certain contaminants may still persist .","Bank filtration is a relative low cost system for raw water treatment or pre-treatment for drinking water abstraction, used in European countries since about 140 years with very good experiences, but up to now knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological processes of water purification is still insufficient, especially under consideration of the application of this technology in other countries. Focus of interest are the mechanical, physicochemical, chemical and biological processes during infiltration pathway such as the retention of particulate organic material (POM), especially of algae cells with toxic cell compounds (cyanobacteria), the turnover of natural organic matter (NOM), bacteria and viruses, and the retention of toxicology relevant micro pollutants like cyanotoxins and drugs. The water infiltration during bank filtration is not only controlled hydraulically but determined by severe clogging processes mainly triggered by accumulation of biological components in the upper sediment layer. Clogging of the interstice is regularly observed in infiltration ponds, and up to now several mechanisms can be distinguished like physical (input of fine sediments, building of gas bubbles), chemical (precipitation mainly of carbonates) and biological processes (excretion of extracellular substances by algae and bacteria). As a consequence water permeability of the interstice will become strictly reduced. The interstice are place of an adapted biocoenosis of bacteria, fungi, algae and meiofauna, which is characterized by the occurrence of extra-cellular polymeric substances (EPS). The meiofauna counteracts the clogging process by detritivorous activity. For many contaminants like DOM, POM, pathogens (Giardia, Cryptosporidium) and cyanobacteria as well as cyanotoxins a good removal is given. The active sediment layer is the first meter of infiltration pathway with a decrease in DOC concentration of up to 50% and high removal rates of 10<sup>2</sup> - 10<sup>4</sup> for pathogens like bacteria and protozoa.
[3]: Surface and ground water are valuable sources for drinking water. Certain industrial, mining, and agricultural practices pollute these critical resources. Riverbank filtration (RBF) is a cost-effective in situ water treatment process, which removes suspended solids and organic and inorganic pollutants. The RBF process is defined as a natural filter of soils and aquifer sediments at the river site. In RBF, river water moves through the pores of the natural soils of the riverbed and riverbank. RBF improves several physical, chemical, and biological properties of the river water. Several treatment actions including, filtration, sorption, and biological degradation occur during this process. Under specific conditions, RBF could be used as a treatment or pretreatment process to remove or decrease pollutants in surface water. In this paper, the effectiveness of RBF in improving the river water quality is presented. RBF as a cost-effective water treatment process is also discussed. Furthermore, factors that affect the performance of the RBF process and its overall effectiveness for developing countries are also discussed."

Application Examples: Medical Diagnosis: Use rule-based systems to support complex medical diagnoses, such as diabetes, by integrating ontology knowledge and designing rules to express relationships between different medical conditions .","Purpose: The 2017 epilepsy and seizure diagnosis framework emphasizes epilepsy syndromes and the etiology-based approach. We developed a propositional artificial intelligence (AI) system based on the above concepts to support physicians in the diagnosis of epilepsy. Methods: We analyzed and built ontology knowledge for the classification of seizure patterns, epilepsy, epilepsy syndrome, and etiologies. Protégé ontology tool was applied in this study. In order to enable the system to be close to the inferential thinking of clinical experts, we classified and constructed knowledge of other epilepsy-related knowledge, including comorbidities, epilepsy imitators, epilepsy descriptors, characteristic electroencephalography (EEG) findings, treatments, etc. We used the Ontology Web Language with Description Logic (OWL-DL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to design rules for expressing the relationship between these ontologies. Results: Dravet syndrome was taken as an illustration for epilepsy syndromes implementation. We designed an interface for the physician to enter the various characteristics of the patients. Clinical data of an 18-year-old boy with epilepsy was applied to the AI system. Through SWRL and reasoning engine Drool's execution, we successfully demonstrate the process of differential diagnosis. Conclusion: We developed a propositional AI system by using the OWL-DL/SWRL approach to deal with the complexity of current epilepsy diagnosis. The experience of this system, centered on the clinical epilepsy syndromes, paves a path to construct an AI system for further complicated epilepsy diagnosis."

This approach uses simulated annealing and Bayesian regularization to enhance the fundamental frequency and achieve a lightweight design, and it is believed that similar optimization techniques could be applied to other structural designs to improve their performance and efficiency in various engineering applications .","In order to improve the dynamic performance of deployable truss structure, a two-level optimization method for composite rods is proposed. The first level optimization takes the number of standard lay-ups as design variable, and the weighted sum of the fundamental frequencies of the truss structure in the folded and deployed states as the objective function. The simulated annealing and Bayesian regularization are employed to obtain the optimal standard spread layers of BP neural network, where the optimal number of standard lay-ups is obtained by the neural network mapping. Based on the results of the first level optimization, the second level optimization takes the orientation and thickness of each layup as the design variables, and a multi-objective optimization is formulated with the objective is to maximize the fundamental frequency and minimize the structural mass. The multi-objective optimization problem is solved by using the NSGA-II algorithm.

s_2034,"The age and material of the sewer pipes also play a role. Older systems, often made of unreinforced concrete or clay tiles, are more susceptible to FOG buildup and subsequent fatberg formation .","Different shaped pipes have been used for centuries to help facilitate low flow velocities in sewer systems for centuries. These non-round sewer pipes were traditionally used in large cities where pipelines were utilized to carry sewer and storm water together. These pipes had the capability to maintain reasonable cleanout velocities for the sewer effluents during times of dry weather, but also had the capacity to carry storm water during significant rain events. These non-round sewer pipes are located all over the globe as part of the city's infrastructure and the performance of these pipelines are incredibly important to each municipality. More specifically, many of the largest cities in the United States such as New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles have these types of sewer pipes in their systems. These pipes were traditionally constructed of unreinforced concrete and bricks or clay tiles. The majority of them were hand crafted manually by arguably some of the most skilled masonry laborers to create very specific profiles to achieve the necessary hydraulic conditions for these cities. With many of these sewer lines being constructed in the early 1900s and with continued city expansion and developments, some of these sewers do not follow the public right-of-ways and even cross underneath existing building and residential housing. Because of the corrosive nature of a sanitary sewer environment, these sewers are now approaching the end of their service life and are in need of structural rehabilitation. With the constraints of public disturbance of digging and replacing the pipes, many city engineers are exploring new methods of restructuring with corrosion resistant materials. The difficult challenge that each engineer faces is to come up with a rehabilitation solutions to match the existing profiles as closely as possible, but the solution also has to have the structural integrity needed to hold up long term. This paper will review a recent project installed in Los Angeles. The City of Los Angeles has utilized the slipline method of rehabilitation for their sewers for decades with circular fiberglass pipes. It has only been recently where they have started to utilize profile fiberglass pipes for these non-round sewer rehabilitation projects. This paper will review the physical property requirements required a profile shaped slipline product including the material testing procedures and results. The design approach for the physical properties was an important part of this project which was a driving factor behind the physical pipe properties. In addition, the construction means and methods will be discussed with the focus on the field variables during the installation."

Rarefied species richness and Shannon's H′ varied unimodally with the distance offshore and depth for all taxa (except sea urchins) and were highest at intermediate distances offshore and depths. There was no significant association between evenness and distance offshore. Evenness did, however, vary with depth and exposure. Overall, models using distance offshore, depth and exposure explained most of the variation in sponge and coral diversity but substantially less variation in foraminifera diversity. Variation in composition depended on distance offshore, depth and exposure although the relative importance of these variables differed among taxa. Depth was the most important parameter for sponges, corals and foraminifera but not for sea urchins. Sponge and coral assemblages differed markedly from in-to-off-shore but there was relatively little variation in foraminifera assemblages with most foraminifera species having broad cross-shelf distributions. Foraminifera assemblages on the contrary differed markedly between exposed and sheltered reef environments; species in exposed reef environments, for example, consisted of species with distinct strategies for coping with the increased hydrodynamic energy. In summary, this study shows that benthic taxa in the Spermonde are distributed along continuous gradients (in-to-off-shore and shallow-to-deep) in addition to occupying discrete habitats related to reef exposure. [4] In order to preserve diversity it is essential to understand how assemblages change across space. Despite this fact, we still know very little about how marine diversity is spatially distributed, especially among lesser-studied invertebrate taxa. In the present study beta-diversity patterns of sea urchins, sponges, mushroom corals and larger foraminifera were assessed in the Spermonde Archipelago (Indonesia). Using ordinations we showed that the inshore zone (<5 km offshore), midshore zone (5 < × < 30 km offshore) and distance offshore zone (<30 km offshore) all contained distinct assemblages of sponges and corals, while only foraminifera assemblages from the inshore (<5 km offshore) zone were distinct. There was a significant spatial pattern of community similarity for all taxa surveyed, but this pattern proved to be wholly related to environmental variables for sponges and foraminifera, and primarily for mushroom corals and sea urchins. The lack of a pure spatial component suggests that these taxa may not be dispersal limited within the spatial scales of this study (c. 1600 km<sup>2</sup>). The analyses of the corals and foraminifera were additionally tested at two spatial scales of sampling. Both taxa were primarily associated with local-scale environmental variables at the local scale and larger-scale variables at the larger scale. Mean inter-plot similarity was also higher and variation lower at the larger scale. The results suggest that substantial variation in similarity can be predicted using simple locally assessed environmental variables combined with remotely sensed parameters. © 2006 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd. [8] This paper examines published information and gray literature about taxonomy and ecology of echinoderm species of the Colombian Pacific Coast. Unpublished collection data of specimens kept in the Marine Sciences Museum of the University of Valle are also considered. Sixty-six species are found in coastal ecosystems and shallow bottoms of ten geographical, coastal and insular localities of the Pacific coast of Colombia. Main habitats having echinoderms are: rocky cliffs and shores, coral reefs, sand beaches, mud substrates, mangroves, and shallow bottoms of mud, sand, gravel and rocks. Regular Echinoidea and Asteroidea are the most diverse and abundant groups, mainly in subtidal rocky shallow bottoms and coral reefs. Ophiuroidea are abundant below rocky boulders. Irregular Echinoidea are abundant on sand beaches. The relatively high number of species shows that this geographical area presents a high diversity of echinoderms compared with other tropical shallow and littoral zones of the world. Rocky substrates and coral reefs are the ecosystems with the highest numbers of echinoderm species and individuals. A conservation status assessment is difficult because the lack of periodical sampling and few data about deep zones. In general, the species reported in the last 25 years, have not experimented important changes in their populations, although in some specific places, populations may decrease because human activities in coastal areas increase sedimentation rates change some rocky substrates to mud or sand."
s_1420,"Effects of Various Supplements on Ruminal Fermentation: Monensin: Monensin supplementation altered VFA metabolism by reducing the interconversion of butyrate and acetate, which could potentially influence TVFA levels .","[1] This study was conducted to investigate the effects of different levels of humic acids on ruminal fermentation, protozoa count and some blood parameters in sheep. Four ruminally cannulated morkaraman rams, 1.5 years old, were used in 4X4 Latin Square Desing with 14 days adaptation and 6 days sampling periods on the way 20 days total. The animals were offered 70% forage and 30% concentrate supplemented with %0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 humate (Bovifarm®). Humic acid supplementation didn't effect the ruminal pH and ruminal ammonia-N (P>0.05). Neither TVFA (Total Volatile Fatty Acid) concentration nor the proportion of acetic acid, propionic acid, butyric acid and acetic/propionic acid ratio in TVFA were affected by supplements. No differences were found among groups for protozoa counts (P>0.05). In blood samples, there were no significant differences among levels for serum total protein, albumine, trigliseride, calcium, phosphorus and VLDL (Very low-density lipoprotein). However, all humic acids levels decreased (P<0.05) the serum cholesterol and LDL (Low-densite lipoprotein); but increased (P<0.05) the HDL (High-density lipoprotein) levels in groups supplemented with %0.2 and 0.4 humic acids, significantly. [6] Context: Rumen biohydrogenation is an important way to produce conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), especially the rumenic acid isomer. However, CLA is principally synthesised endogenously in lactating mammals by delta 9-desaturase in breast tissue. Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate milk fatty acid profile, rumen microbial population and animal performance in response to diets containing sunflower oil either supplemented with or without flavonoids and essential oils from Piper betle L. powder (PP) in dairy goats. Method: Twelve multiparous Saanen goats (42 ± 1.00 kg; mean ± s.d.) were randomly assigned to two treatment groups in an experiment that lasted for 6 weeks. The two experimental diets formulated as total mixed ration were: Control (CTH) diet (containing 0% PP) and DPB diet (CTH diet containing 1.3% PP on a dry-matter basis). Key results: Inclusion of flavonoids and essential oils from PP in the diet (DPB) did not affect dry-matter intake but resulted in a greater milk yield and altered the composition of milk. Compared with the control diet (CTH), the DPB diet decreased the saturated fatty acid concentration and increased the unsaturated fatty acid concentration in milk. Inclusion of PP decreased the C18:0 production (P < 0.05), resulting in higher C18:1 trans11 and C18:2 cis9 trans11 (P < 0.05) concentrations. Overall, DPB diet increased the total CLA by 1.5-fold, from 1.77 to 2.62 g/100 g fatty acid. The desaturase rate (except desaturase for carbon 18, P < 0.05), and atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were not affected by inclusion of PP in the DPB diet. Moreover, the DPB diet escalated total volatile fatty acid production and altered the volatile fatty acid profile. Compared with goats fed with CTH diet, PP supplementation increased the presence of ruminal Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens by ∼5-fold, but the presence of B. proteoclasticus decreased to about 1/11 of the control. Conclusions: The use of sunflower oil at 17.6 g/kg diet and inclusion of a practical dose of flavonoids and essential oils from Piper betle L. leaves in the diet of dairy goats can be an efficient method to improve milk yield and milk composition, including increasing the CLA concentration of milk. Implications: These results constitute an alternative strategy to improve milk quality, without negatively affecting animal performance.  [7] The addition of natural plant secondary compounds to ruminant feed has been extensively studied because of their ability to modify digestive and metabolic functions, resulting in a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, among other benefits. Condensed tannin (CT) supplementation may alter ruminal fermentation and mitigate methane (CH4) emissions. This study's objective was to determine the effect of quebracho CT extract [QT; Schinopsis quebracho-colorado (Schltdl.) F.A. Barkley & T. Meyer] within a roughage-based diet on ruminal digestibility and kinetic parameters by using the in situ and in vitro gas production techniques, in addition to blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ruminal (volatile fatty acid [VFA], NH3-N, and protozoa count) parameters. Twenty rumen-cannulated steers were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: QT at 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% of dry matter (DM; QT0: 0% CT, QT1: 0.70% CT, QT2: 1.41% CT, and QT3: 2.13% CT). The in situ DM digestibility increased linearly (P = 0.048) as QT inclusion increased, whereas in situ neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD) was not altered among treatments (P = 0.980). Neither total VFA concentration nor acetate-to-propionate ratio differed among dietary treatments (P = 0.470 and P = 0.873, respectively). However, QT3 had lower isovalerate and isobutyrate concentrations compared with QT0 (P ≤ 0.025). Ruminal NH3 and BUN tended to decline (P ≤ 0.075) in a linear fashion as QT inclusion increased, suggesting decreased deamination of feed protein. Ruminal protozoa count was reduced in quadratic fashion (P = 0.005) as QT inclusion increased, where QT1 and QT2 were lower compared with QT0 and QT3. Urinary N excretion tended to reduce in a linear fashion (P = 0.080) as QT increased. There was a treatment (TRT) × Day interaction for in vitro total gas production and fractional rate of gas production (P = 0.013 and P = 0.007, respectively), and in vitro NDFD tended to be greater for QT treatments compared with no QT inclusion (P = 0.077). There was a TRT × Day interaction (P = 0.001) on CH4 production, with QT3 having less CH4 production relative to QT0 on day 0 and QT2 on days 7 and 28. Feeding QT up to 3% of the dietary DM in a roughage-based diet did not sacrifice the overall DM digestibility and ruminal parameters over time. Still, it is unclear why QT2 did not follow the same pattern as in vitro gas parameters. Detailed evaluations of amino acid degradation might be required to fully define CT influences on ruminal fermentation parameters and CH4 production."

s_2150,Advanced techniques like hyperspectral imaging and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry are suggested for more accurate analysis of airborne MPs .,"[15] The generation of microplastics (MPs) has increased recently and become an emerging issue globally. Due to their long-term durability and capability of traveling between different habitats in air, water, and soil, MPs presence in freshwater ecosystem threatens the environment with respect to its quality, biotic life, and sustainability. Although many previous works have been undertaken on the MPs pollution in the marine system recently, none of the study has covered the scope of MPs pollution in the freshwater. To consolidate scattered knowledge in the literature body into one place, this work identifies the sources, fate, occurrence, transport pathways, and distribution of MPs pollution in the aquatic system with respect to their impacts on biotic life, degradation, and detection techniques. This article also discusses the environmental implications of MPs pollution in the freshwater ecosystems. Certain techniques for identifying MPs and their limitations in applications are presented. Through a literature survey of over 276 published articles (2000–2023), this study presents an overview of solutions to the MP pollution, while identifying research gaps in the body of knowledge for further work. It is conclusive from this review that the MPs exist in the freshwater due to an improper littering of plastic waste and its degradation into smaller particles. Approximately 15–51 trillion MP particles have accumulated in the oceans with their weight ranging between 93,000 and 236,000 metric ton (Mt), while about 19–23 Mt of plastic waste was released into rivers in 2016, which was projected to increase up to 53 Mt by 2030. A subsequent degradation of MPs in the aquatic environment results in the generation of NPs with size ranging from 1 to 1000 nm. It is expected that this work facilitates stakeholders to understand the multi-aspects of MPs pollution in the freshwater and recommends policy actions to implement sustainable solutions to this environmental problem."
s_1207,"In summary, the classification and management of polytrauma involve a combination of scoring systems, clinical guidelines, advanced imaging techniques, and comprehensive rehabilitation programs. These approaches ensure that patients receive timely and effective care, improving overall outcomes and recovery .","Polytrauma is a syndrome of multiple injuries exceeding a defined severity (Injury Severity Score [ISS] = 17) with sequential systemic reactions that can lead to dysfunction or failure of remote organs and vital systems, which have not themselves been directly injured.
[2]: Background: Polytrauma patients with a severity score over 16 points are at a risk of development of immunologically derived complications (infection, ""2<sup>nd</sup>-hit injuries""). The aim of this study is to evaluate the phagocytic arm of the immune system in patients with polytrauma during a period of time, which is critical for therapeutic decisions. The phagocytic arm is analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 7 men and 5 women from 20 to 84 years of age who had sustained a polytrauma as a result of mechanical factors. Polytrauma was severe (over 16 points ISS - Injury Severity Score) in all of the cases. All patients were studied on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day after trauma. Nine CNS -injured patients (isolated injury) and eleven healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. Results: A statistically significant and higher individual cellular phagocytic activity (number of bacteria per cell) was observed in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day when compared to CNS -injured patients. The percentages of granulocytes showing phagocytosis in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower when compared to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. The percentages of granulocytes showing enzymatic activity in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower comparing to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. Statistically significant and higher enzymatic activity of granulocytes was observed on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day in polytrauma patients when compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: A significant deficiency of the phagocytic arm was observed during a period of time, which is critical for definitive surgical interventions in polytrauma patients. The phagocytic arm shouldbe analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery.
[3]: Objective: Data in trauma registries need to be reliable when used for evaluation of injury management, trauma protocols and hospital statistics. The aim of this audit was to analyse the reliability of the data in the Trauma Centre West Netherlands (TCWN) region. Design: Routinely registered trauma patients from all nine hospitals in the TCWN region were reregistered by a registrar for analysis. Setting: Nine hospitals in the TCWN region in the Netherlands. Participants: A randomly selected representative trauma population sample of 350 patients and a sample of 100 polytrauma patients were re-registered and used for analysis. Intervention: Re-registration of trauma patients in the Trauma Registry. Main Outcome Measure(s): The inter-rater agreement on Injury Severity Score (ISS), number of Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) codes, identical codes and survival status were analysed using Kappa's coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results: The inter-rater agreement on ISS and number of AIS codes were, respectively, almost perfect (ICC = 0.81) and substantial (ICC = 0.76) in the trauma population sample, and substantial (ICC = 0.70) and fair (ICC = 0.33) in the polytrauma sample. For patients with serious injuries (AIS = 2) in the population sample, the inter-rater agreement on ISS (ICC = 0.87) and number of AIS codes (ICC = 0.84) were almost perfect. Conclusions: These results confirm that the Dutch regional registry system works well and may serve as a reliable basis for prospective analysis of national and international trauma care. Particular attention should be paid to the coding of polytrauma patients as discrepancies are more likely to occur in this group.
[4]: The first phase in the management of the polytraumatised animal is general screening and treatment of circulatory, respiratory and/or neurological disorders, which consequently provides the prognosis for survival. Once the immediate vital problems are under control, the second phase consists of determination of lesions that may affect the survival or function of the polytraumatised animal. The CRASH-PLAN protocol appears to be the most practical and effective method to prevent omission of any lesions. A step-by-step complete clinical examination is performed and backed up by ancillary examinations, notably medical imagery. The main lesions seen in polytraumatised animals and initial treatment measures are described in the article.
[5]: The arrest of several potential assassins in Germany in recent months leads to the assumption that terror attacks with firearms and explosive devices like those that happened in Paris (2015) and Brussels (2016) could also take place in German cities. In such situations, the treatment fundamentals for mass casualty incidents take priority over the well-known fundamentals of individual medical treatment approaches. However, new research results emphasize that even under optimal treatment circumstances the outcome of vascular traumatized patients is underestimated when the mortality rate is calculated using established trauma score systems. The 2016 revised S3 clinical guideline Polytrauma-/Schwerverletzten-Behandlung from the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie (Polytrauma/severe injury treatment from the German Trauma Society) addresses the modification of known and new inclusion of recommendations for the treatment of critical bleeding. The following article focusses on vascular traumatized patients with gunshot wounds and injuries from explosive devices. The new recommendations for preclinical critical bleeding treatment is highlighted based on the S3 guidelines.

[7]: Technical advances in the past decade have made computed tomography (CT) increasingly valuable in the early clinical management of patients with polytrauma. The development of multidetector CT (MDCT) has transformed CT from a simple, crosssectional imaging technique to an advanced, threedimensional (3-D) imaging modality, enabling excellent 3-D displays [1]. Multislice CT scanning is associated with a substantial gain in performance, decreased scan times, reduced section collimation, and reduction in scan length. The combined value of MDCT and 3-D reformations in assessment of the musculoskeletal system has been documented in the literature. The high contrast interface between bone and adjacent tissues in the musculoskeletal system makes it ideal for 3-D evaluation. The increased acquisition speed of MDCT with superior image resolution enables rapid diagnostic work up and institution of therapy in the setting of musculoskeletal trauma. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Italia."

The study aimed to find out the growth and nutritional status of the Kamar children, a primitive tribe of Chhattisgarh. Four anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and head circumference are taken into consideration. All the anthropometric measurements show an increasing trend with age in both sexes but it is not uniform in all the ages. However, when height and weight of the Kamar boys and girls were compared with all India (ICMR) children, the Kamar children (both boys and girls) shows lower weight (lighter) and height (shorter) and the difference are significant for almost all the age group except 7 and 9 years of boys and 4 to 7 years of girls in the case of height. BMi is very low in both the sexes and show 81.03 per cent of boys and 74.87 per cent of girls are suffered from CED-III grade of malnutrition. Socio-economic and educational status of this primitive tribe may be one of the major causes for this poor growth and nutritional status.

i_1196,Recommendations for Healthcare Providers: Neglecting the assessment of caregivers' needs and delaying interventions can hinder caregiver support and worsen stroke rehabilitation outcomes .,"Changing needs of Chinese family caregivers of stroke survivorsAim. To examine the changing needs of Chinese family caregivers before and after stroke survivors' discharge from hospital. Background. Stroke ranks third as the most common cause of death in Hong Kong and is the leading cause of adult disability. Community care has been adopted as the major source of care for older people in Hong Kong and this has impacted on family caregivers. Design and methods. This is a descriptive-correlational design using a within-subjects design. The needs of 40 Chinese family caregivers who met the inclusion criteria were assessed before discharge and two weeks later using the Carer Assessment Scale, Cost of Care Index and one open-ended question. Modified Barthel Index measured the functional ability of stroke survivors. Results. Family caregivers are able to anticipate most of their needs and to make provision to meet the basic practical needs before discharge. Although needs changed after discharge the four most important needs persisted. These were associated with emotional and psychological problems and financial difficulties. Discharge destinations made no difference to the total scores obtained using the above scales. Conclusions. This study provides information about need at a time of transition in an under-researched population of Chinese caregivers. Assessment of need is important with Chinese family carers in order to identify focused interventions in a population, i.e. reluctant to make their needs known to professional services. More research about caregiving problems for Chinese family caregivers at the transition from hospital to community is required. Relevance to clinical practice. Ongoing need assessment by nurses who are in regular contact with caregivers in hospital and community will enable appropriate interventions such as providing education and emotional support both before and after discharge to be offered to Chinese communities. © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
s_1610,"Agroecological Approaches: Agroecology promotes the use of diverse cropping systems, cover crops, and reduced tillage to manage weeds sustainably while preserving ecological balance and biodiversity .","Weed management in agriculture is hampered by inefficient intensive methods, such as monoculture, deep plowing, and herbicides, leading to health and environmental problems. Furthermore, the prevalence of herbicide-resistant weed ecotypes in the Mediterranean, particularly in France (with over 61 ecotypes), Spain (41), and Italy (37), is a major concern, with a significant proportion of herbicides in the region. In this study, we examined the benefits of adopting agroecology as a sustainable approach for weed management in the Mediterranean region. Agroecology offers a variety of techniques and practices to improve sustainability and weed management, while preserving ecological balance and biodiversity. However, solving these challenges is multifactorial and depends on local specificities, predominant weed species, crops, sowing dates, and pedo-climatic factors. In addition, this study included a systematic analysis of agroecological weed management in Mediterranean countries, assessing the effectiveness of existing practices, and identifying areas requiring further exploration in agroecosystems. A bibliometric analysis was also included to assess the literature on agroecology and weed management quantitatively, identifying major trends, influential studies, and research gaps. The bibliometric analysis highlighted the importance of alternative herbicides in Mediterranean ""weed"" (with a link strength of 44), ""agroecology"" (22), and ""biodiversity"" (16). Italy has the strongest collaboration network, with a link strength of 61, followed by Turkey (44), and France (42). Using specific keywords to agroecological practices for weed management in Scopus, France worked the most in this context (around 25% of studies), followed by Spain (17%) and Italy (17%), while all other countries contributed to less than 40% of studies carried out in the Mediterranean context. Clearly, it is imperative to foster collaboration between Mediterranean countries to develop effective and sustainable weed control strategies. Understanding the challenges of herbicide-resistant weeds, exploring their reasons and mechanisms, and using systematic studies and bibliometric analyses will help to develop effective strategies for managing weeds in the Mediterranean. Agroecological management favors effective control, while promoting healthy and sustainable ecosystems, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring long-term food security.
[15]: The sustainability of agriculture relies on the development of strategies that lower the need for costly external inputs and minimize detrimental effects on the environment, which often involve either inappropriate or excessive use of agrochemical inputs. One strategy, integrating plant allelopathy into sustainable agriculture, is discussed in this paper. Agriculture integrated with allelopathy could reduce the heavy dependence on synthetic herbicides and other agrochemicals, and therefore ease problems such as environmental contamination, use of unsafe agricultural products and effects on human health. The allelopathy-integrated management of weeds includes various techniques such as the use of allelopathy in crop rotation, preceding and cover crops, green manure, mulch, and intercropping, as well as the incorporation of allelopathic plants in soil. In addition, the enhancement of weed-suppressing ability in crops is an important task in sustainable agricultural production. Even though many secondary metabolites involved in allelopathic activities have been isolated and identified, numerous allelochemicals remain unknown. The search for allelochemicals with novel modes of action is important for the development of bioactive pesticides. Despite the fact that the direct use of allelochemicals as natural pesticides is difficult in the field because of their easy degradation in nature and high cost of delivery, the synthesis of compounds derived from these allelochemicals may help resolve these problems. © CABI Publishing 2007."
s_2089,"Microbial Community Dynamics and Process Instability: Feedstock Variations: Changes in feedstock do not lead to significant shifts in the microbial community. For instance, co-digesting food waste with waste-activated sludge (WAS) can destabilize the process by promoting VFA accumulation and disrupting methanogenic activity .","Anaerobic digestion is applied worldwide to treat food waste (FW) with the aim of obtaining renewable bioenergy by exploiting the methane gas produced. However, there are several problems in practical applications, primarily due to system instability. Although exhaustive knowledge regarding anaerobic microbial community composition has been established, few studies have investigated long-term correlations between microbial consortia, operative conditions and feedstock characteristics. Here, microbial community shifts as a response to feedstock variations were investigated in long-term semi-continuous systems, which were evaluated by an in situ cell detection method and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. FW digestion showed progressive system instability caused by the inhibition of methanogens, which resulted in volatile fatty acid accumulation and process failure at the low organic loading rate (OLR). Conversely, by co-digesting FW with waste-activated sludge (WAS), a stable process with methane yields of up to 0.27 Nm<sup>3</sup> kg<sup>−1</sup>VS<inf>fed</inf> for OLR = 1.7 gVS L<sup>−1</sup>d<sup>−1</sup> was achieved. This stabilizing effect was not related to the buffering capacity of WAS, but to its capacity to avoid volatile fatty acid accumulation and falls in pH by overcoming methanogenic activity inhibition. WAS addition promoted the establishment of a stable and active archaeal population in anaerobic co-digestion (AcoD) reactors. The continuous supply of trace elements together with the seeding of microbial functional groups were the main drivers that positively affected process stability."

This method has shown high efficiency in volatile solids decomposition and biogas generation .","[20] Water reclamation and reuse is an important worldwide integrated water resources planning and management topic as the limitations of freshwater resources have come into sharp focus. In the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), potable water is produced from either non- or very slowly renewable water resources such as groundwater, or capital-and energy-intensive seawater desalination. The KSA also lacks sufficient water and wastewater treatment capacity to meet future demands. In response, the KSA is developing reclaimed water sources to help meet future demands. Key public and private KSA organizations are working in partnership to expand the application of reclaimed water. Among these are the National Water Company (NWC), the Ministry of Water and Electricity (MOWE), and the King Abdullah University for Science and Technology (KAUST) Industry Collaboration Program (KICP). These organizations have been responsible for actions to promote reuse in the KSA and will oversee and promote the implementation process to meet the aggressive new goals. The KSA has embraced a goal to significantly expand the availability of reuse quality treated sewage effluent (RQTSE) for a wide variety of uses and KAUST has published a comprehensive study of water reuse's role in integrated water resources management to identify technology and data gaps that need to be addressed to support successful reclamation and reuse, as well as business opportunities where reuse would support sustainable and integrated water management objectives. Implementing beneficial reuse opportunities is critical to meet future water demand, but must be cost-effective for users and profitable for providers. The study finds that capturing these business opportunities and supporting overall resource sustainability goals depends on the following actions: Instituting rational tariff structures for first use water and RQTSE that support significant capital and operational investments. Recognizing social and cultural differences in the ability and willingness to pay. Adopting regulations to support an integrated water resources planning approach. Increasing public awareness of the need for RQTSE and gaining acceptance for its use. Instituting a system (a proposed National Water Data Center) that supports collaborative planning by documenting: water demands; wastewater treated volumes; RQTSE used; and water quality, monitoring, and enforcement data. Coordinating specific actions and milestones, including strengthened regulations, to meet local, regional, and national goals are met. This comprehensive study confirms that financially sound, practical, and environmentally sustainable opportunities to expand water reuse and integrated water management exist in all regions and in all sectors of the KSA. Recommendations of the study are focused to protect investments, ensure cost-effectiveness, and facilitate coordination across sectors, provinces, regions, cities, and agencies. © 2012 ASCE."

Distinguishing these tumors from each other on biopsy material is important clinically, as optimal therapy differs according to the tumor type. However, separating these entities on morphology alone can be challenging. FLI-1 has been described to be a useful marker for Ewing sarcoma, particularly when hematolymphoid markers are negative. In small cell osteosarcoma and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma, the FLI-1 staining pattern has not been adequately characterized. Using a monoclonal FLI-1 antibody, nuclear immunoreactivity in tumor cells was evaluated in 10 small cell osteosarcomas, 10 mesenchymal chondrosarcomas, and 8 Ewing sarcomas, together with a number of other small, round, blue cell tumors. None of the small cell osteosarcomas or mesenchymal chondrosarcomas exhibited FLI-1 staining in the tumor cells, in contrast to the positive nuclear FLI-1 staining in the stromal endothelial cells. In comparison, 6 of the 8 Ewing sarcomas showed moderate-to-strong nuclear FLI-1 staining of the tumor cells in addition to strong staining of the stromal endothelial cell nuclei. With the exception of lymphoblastic lymphomas, FLI-1 positivity was not seen in the other small round blue cell tumors examined. These findings show that, in contrast to Ewing sarcoma, small cell osteosarcoma and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma lack FLI-1 immunoreactivity. FLI-1 is therefore useful in the differential diagnosis of small round blue cell tumors of the bone. Copyright © 2011 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
[8]: Because of its characteristic morphologic appearance, small cell osteosarcoma (SCO) can be confused with other small round cell malignancies of the bone, most importantly with Ewing sarcoma, making this distinction difficult. A specific tool used in separating SCO from Ewing sarcoma has been the detection of Ewing sarcoma breakpoint region 1 (EWSR1) gene rearrangements in Ewing sarcoma and their absence in SCO. However, there are rare case reports that have documented the existence of EWSR1 gene rearrangement in SCO. In this report, we describe another case of SCO with an EWSR1 gene rearrangement detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. Our finding adds support to the existing evidence that SCO is a tumor that can be characterized by EWSR1 gene arrangements. Therefore, we caution the pathology community not to rely solely on molecular studies in distinguishing SCO from Ewing sarcoma. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
s_1836,"Individual-Level Strategies: Behavioral Models: Tailoring interventions to different behavioral models is likely to be effective, although it may not significantly impact those who are indifferent or opposed to recycling, as they are generally resistant to change .","The aim of the article is to identify what valuable and motivational factors lie behind the choice of Lithuanian residents how to manage - sort or not to sort - their houshold waste. Using the tools and the research model provided by Theory of Planned Behavior, it is tied to examine the prevailing normative, moral, and control beliefs influencing the recycling behaviour. As a sample of qualitative research, inhabitants of the Alytus city municipality are chosen - the population of the most advanced region in the field of waste management (it is assumed that the region's recycling infrastructure and information available to population are relatively highest in Lithuania, so it allows to focus only on the factors falling within the values and motivation category); 32 semi-structured interviews are conducted. On the basis of the research findings, four prevailing behavioral models are distinguished: (1) ""I do sort!"" - active and conscious, (2) ""I do as needed"" - passive but acting, (3) ""I will not do!"" - frustrated and opposing, (3) ""I do not care."" - unthinking and dormant. The author argues that all of them are determined by a different conjuncture of the factors identified, and therefore interventions to promote or change it a should be based on the characteristics of each type of behavior. Recommendations for policy strategies to improve household waste management are given."

These systems use real-time data to adjust traffic signals and manage vehicle and pedestrian flows efficiently .","In the fast-growing world, smart cities' rapid and inevitable development significantly affects urban planning and development policies. One of the most important aspects of smart city management is monitoring, analyzing, and forecasting urban user behavior (hottest spots, trajectories, flows, etc.).In urban planning, the traffic pattern is an extended term that requires firm refinement of transportation policies, posing significant challenges in a smart city environment. Developing methodologies and tools for analyzing people's behavior in cities is essential in this environment. Hence, this study, the In-Depth Learning-based Integrated Urban Planning and Development Framework (DLI-UPDF), has been proposed to support policy-making in smart cities to improve traffic patterns for modern public transport. The Smart Urban Traffic Planning (SUTP) method uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to optimize red and green signals for both vehicle and pedestrian flow control. The authors address smart vehicles and social networks' possible use to identify and mitigate traffic congestions quickly and accurately evaluate the latest innovations in the different processes involved in a Parallel Transportation Scheme (PTS). Using Wi-Fi Access Points to monitor and analyze city user behavior is discussed in this article, which provides a high level of accuracy. This technique is shown using heat maps, origin-destination matrices, and estimates of user density. The Experimental results show that the proposed DLI-UPDF method and IoT optimize the traffic flow to enhance accuracy, prediction ratio, Flexibility, Efficiency, and performance ratio compared to other existing methods.
[7]: According to United Nations (UN) 2030 agenda, the transportation system needs to be enhanced for the establishment of access to safe, affordable, accessible, and sustainable transport systems along with enhanced road safety. The highway road transport system is one of the transport systems that enables to transits goods and humans from one location to another location. The agenda of UN 2030 for the transport system will be accomplished with the assistance of digital technologies like the internet of things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI). The implementation of these digital technologies on highways empowers to provide reliable, smarter, intelligent, and renewable energy sources experience to the users travelling along the highways. This study discusses the significance of the digitalization of highways that supporting and realizing a sustainable environment on the highways. To discuss the significance of digitalization, the study has categorized digitalization into five subcomponents namely smart highway lighting system, smart traffic and emergency management system, renewable energy sources on highways, smart display and AI in highways. An architecture-for smart highway lighting, smart traffic, and emergency management are proposed and discussed in the study. The significance of implementing smart display boards and renewable sources with real-time applications is also addressed in this study. Moreover, the integration of AI in highways is addressed with the perspective of enhancing road safety. The integration of deep learning (DL) in the edge-based vision node for predicting the patterns of traffic flow, highway road safety, and maintenance of quality roads have been addressed in the discussion section. Embedding the deep learning techniques in the vison node at the traffic junction and the highway lighting controller is able to deliver an intelligent system that provides sustained experience and management of the highways. Smart reflectors, adoption of renewable energy, developing vehicle-to-vehicle communication in vehicles, and smart lamppost are the few recommendations for the implementation of digitalizing highways."

This study aimed to compare the effect of MCFA, either supplied through krabok (KO) or coconut (CO) oil, on rumen fermentation, protozoal counts and archaeal abundance, as well as their diversity and functional organization. KO contains similar amounts of C12:0 as CO (420 and 458 g/kg FA, respectively), but has a higher proportion of C14:0 (464 v. 205 g/kg FA, respectively). Treatments contained 35 g supplemental fat per kg DM: a control diet with tallow (T); a diet with supplemental CO; and a diet with supplemental KO. A 4th treatment consisted of a diet with similar amounts of MCFA (i.e. C10:0+C12:0+C14:0) from CO and KO. To ensure isolipidic diets, extra tallow was supplied in the latter treatment (KO+T). Eight fistulated bulls (two bulls per treatment), fed a total mixed ration predominantly based on cassava chips, rice straw, tomato pomace, rice bran and soybean meal (1.5% of BW), were used. Both KO and CO increased the rumen volatile fatty acids, in particular propionate and decreased acetate proportions. Protozoal numbers were reduced through the supplementation of an MCFA source (CO, KO and KO+T), with the strongest reduction by KO. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays based on archaeal primers showed a decrease in abundance of Archaea when supplementing with KO and KO+T compared with T and CO. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles of the rumen archaeal population did not result in a grouping of treatments. Richness indices were calculated from the number of DGGE bands, whereas community organization was assessed from the Pareto-Lorenz eveness curves on the basis of DGGE band intensities. KO supplementation (KO and KO+T treatments) increased richness and evenness within the archaeal community. Further research including methane measurements and productive animals should elucidate whether KO could be used as a dietary methane mitigation strategy. © The Animal Consortium 2013."

We use human translation and machine translation (Google Translate) on a collection of aligned sentences from United Nations documents extracted from the Multi-UN corpus, analyzed with a ""bag of words"" analysis tool, Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC). Overall, the LIWC indices proved relatively stable across machine and human translated sentences. We find that while there are statistically significant differences between the original and translated documents, the effect sizes are relatively small, especially when looking at psychological processes."
i_2129,"Technological and Ecological Considerations: Participatory action research across food value chains (FVCs) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS) that address specific aspects of production, processing, marketing, and consumption . However, these strategies need holistic assessments of social, ecological, economic, and institutional challenges before widespread adoption.","[6] Food policies are focused on ensuring the consumption needs of the existing population in a given territory. In general, food policies are built on food continuity and production based on a pool of natural resources available at a given time. Critical food security incidents, particularly the epidemiological crises in livestock farming from a geographical area can significantly affect the population's food resources and disrupt applicable local and national food policies. Thus in some cases it is necessary to adopt food security plans and biosecurity procedures in order to isolate outbreaks, and limit the spread of the epidemic, protect the unaffected food and mitigate the negative impact of the crisis on the local sources of agro food production. The main objective of the study was the analysis of food policies in Romania in the context of the recent outbreak of African swine fever epidemic. Based on bibliographic documentation and processing of official information on the effects of the epidemic on swine farms, the authors have proposed a food sustainability statistical model with practical applicability in assessing and quantifying the effects of African swine fever crisis in Romania. The results of the study showed the possibility of statistical modelling of the national food security indicators in the event of critical incidents in the agro-food chain. The model implementation simulation highlighted potential beneficial economic effects by modifying Romania's food policies. The research results are new at national level, with a potential positive impact on scientific research in the field of economic and agro-food production. The designed statistical model may be useful to economic operators and, in particular, to national authorities in order to adjust food policies in critical food security situations, to limit the phenomena of destabilizing the consumer market and to avoid possible economic disruptions due to crisis situations in the livestock production sector. [12] This chapter describes the current activities of a multi-stakeholder project known as the ""Processing Node of Global TraPs"" which focuses on the sustainable management of the global phosphorus cycle. The node team will outline the current state on phosphorus processing (rock phosphate concentrate and phosphorus- rich secondary materials to fertilizers, feed phosphates, and non-agricultural products), identify knowledge gaps as well as critical questions and sketch areas for potential transdisciplinary case studies. The node's critical questions refer to efficiencies, losses, and the environmental footprint of the various manufacturing processes as well as the effects of applying products in terms of fertilizing value, spreading/accumulation of pollutants, and eutrophication as a result of excessive application. Further issues involve the future of local, not fully integrated processing and identification of potential knowledge gaps. The guiding question is, How to improve the energy, water and material flow balances during the production of fertilizers and other P-based products? Currently, phosphate processing primarily concerns chemical processing (91 % of concentrates) with acids. Only 5 % of rocks are thermally processed to elemental phosphorus. If the latest technologies are employed, P losses during chemical processing generally do not exceed 5 %. The widely used phosphoric acid route (72–78 %of concentrates) transfers impurities to the product or to phosphogypsum, a massive by-product/waste flow amounting to five tonnes per tonne of P2O5 in phosphoric acid. About 82 %of rock phosphates are processed to fertilizers, 6–8 % to feed phosphates and the rest to non-agricultural products for a wide variety of applications. Rock processing is usually located near a phosphate mine in highly integrated manufacturing plants designed to process low-impurity rocks to water-soluble phosphate fertilizers with high nutrient concentrations. However, changing natural, societal, and environmental framework conditions challenge the prevailing paradigms. Benefits and drawbacks of high nutrient concentrations and water solubility will be investigated in transdisciplinary case studies, preferably in cooperation with an integrated global phosphate industry. Even though 82 % of rock phosphates are eventually used as fertilizers, they represent only 36 % of P inputs to European soils, by far outnumbered by the P inputs from secondary resources, such as manure, which account for 63 %. Excessive P application in regions with high livestock density and nutrient mining in regions with neither relevant animal husbandry nor access to mineral fertilizers represent a global environmental and food security problem."
s_1126,"Key Points: General Timeframes for Pancytopenia Development: In other contexts, such as chemotherapy-induced cytopenias, the onset can range from a few days to several weeks after starting treatment . This variability indicates that the timeframe for pancytopenia development can be quite broad and patient-specific.","BACKGROUND: The incidence, dynamics, and management of cytopenias were investigated in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in chronic phase (CP CML) who received dasatinib therapy after imatinib failure. METHODS: Data were analyzed from 130 patients with CP CML who were treated with dasatinib from November 2003 to March 2006 in phase 1 (n = 22) or phase 2 or 3 (n = 108) studies for the development of grade 2 to 4 cytopenia (according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria [version 3.0]). RESULTS: Grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia occurred in 94 (72%) patients during dasatinib therapy and grade 3 to 4 occurred in 67 (52%) patients. Of the 94 patients who developed grade 2 to 4 neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia, 64 (68%) also developed at least grade 2 anemia, and 16 (17%) developed grade 3 to 4 anemia. Management of cytopenias included transient dasatinib interruption in 35 (37%) patients, filgrastim in 12 (14%) patients, recombinant erythropoietin in 29 (45%) patients, and interleukin-11 in 3 (5%) patients. Factors associated with an increased risk for developing grade 2 to 4 cytopenias were longer time from diagnosis to treatment, prior interferon or imatinib therapy, and a lower white blood cell count at the initiation of dasatinib therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Hematologic toxicity was frequent during dasatinib therapy in patients with CP CML, particularly at doses >100 mg daily. Treatment interruption and/or dose reduction as well as growth factor support were found to be safe and efficacious strategies to facilitate the continuous administration of dasatinib. © 2009 American Cancer Society.
[3]: Background: Thrombocytopenia is one of the most common toxicities of chemotherapy, causing symptoms ranging from mild petechiae to debilitating bleeding. These effects can lead to treatment delay and discontinuation, which subsequently affects outcome. The data on chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is scarce, especially from the developing world, and until now there is no consensus on the appropriate management of this complication. Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in pediatric patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Methods: Medical records of acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients who were diagnosed and treated in 2019 at the only center for pediatric hematologic and oncologic disorders in Armenia – the Pediatric Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Armenia – were retrospectively reviewed. Results: A total of 29 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, who were subsequently treated with International BFM (Berlin, Frankfurt, Muenster) Study Group acute lymphoblastic leukemia IC BFM 2009 protocol and achieved remission, were included in the current study. 17 (58%) patients were males. The median age was 4.5y. and range, 18 months – 17 years. 5 patients had T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 24 patients, Bacute lymphoblastic leukemia. During induction therapy, 11 patients (38%) developed critical thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 21×10<sup>3</sup>/L to 46×10<sup>3</sup>/L. During consolidation therapy, 16 patients (55%) developed moderate thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts ranging from 70×10<sup>3</sup>/L to 86×10<sup>3</sup>/L and 6 (21%) patients had critical thrombocytopenia, with platelet counts ranging from 27×10<sup>3</sup>/L to 36×10<sup>3</sup>/L. During the re-induction phase of therapy, 21 (72%) patients developed critical chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia with platelet counts ranging from 13×10<sup>3</sup>/L to 45×10<sup>3</sup>/L. Isolated thrombocytopenia occurred in 3 (10%) of the patients. Thrombocytopenia was managed by platelet transfusion. The median (range) pre-transfusion platelet count was 10×10<sup>9</sup> /L (5×10<sup>9</sup> –13×10<sup>9</sup>/L) and increased significantly post-transfusion to 22×10<sup>9</sup>/L. Conclusions: During the course of therapy the vast majority of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia developed clinically significant thrombocytopenia. Although our study is small and involves the cases from one year, it includes all the acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated in Armenia. The study clearly shows that chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia is a very common complication of acute lymphoblastic leukemia therapy and larger studies needed to explore these findings."
s_1733,"Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions: AWD significantly reduces methane emissions from rice fields, contributing to lower greenhouse gas emissions .","The supply of irrigation in Thailand is currently insufficient to satisfy rice production demands, despite the country being the world's leading rice producer and exporter. Thus, traditional rice production based on flooding systems should be changed to water-saving management using the so-called alternate wetting and drying method (AWD). This research introduced a suitable AWD 5/-15 broadcasting method into farmer's fields in eight provinces of Thailand in the dry and wet seasons of 2016. The results showed that the AWD practice increased grain yields by 8-22% in the dry season compared with the yields from farmer's practices. The AWD practice reduced total water use by 5-30% and increased water productivity 10-35% compared with farmer's traditional practices. In addition, the total CH<inf>4</inf> emissions from the AWD practice in the dry season were lower than those from farmer's practices by 7-83%, but the AWD practice in the wet season resulted in decreased CH<inf>4</inf> emissions at only three out of the eight sites. The total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were slightly different between the AWD and farmer's practices. However, in both AWD and farmer's practices, N<inf>2</inf>O emissions were much lower than CH<inf>4</inf> emissions. Finally, the incomes and net profits in both seasons were significantly higher using AWD from 4.4-13.5 USD/ha and 45.8-60.8 USD/ha, respectively, while the total costs for both practices were not significantly different. Thus, AWD practices may help farmers decrease their water supply risk, especially in the dry season, and increase profits from rice production.
[2]: As one of the most widely promoted effective irrigation strategies for rice, alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation can not only reduce water use but also increase mineral nutrient use efficiency. In this research, we compared the differences in grain yield, grain quality, phosphorus use efficiency (PUE), and growth states of roots and shoots of lowland and upland rice cultivars that were subjected to different irrigation and phosphorus (P) fertilizer application treatments in a field study for two years. The irrigation treatments consisted of two irrigation regimes: continuously flooded (CF) and AWD irrigation and the P fertilizer treatments included three P rates, i.e., 0, 45, and 90 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> (P0, P45, and P90, respectively). The results revealed that AWD irrigation led to an increase in grain yield and improved PUE of both rice varieties at P45. The roots were longer and deeper under AWD irrigation, which contributed to the higher grain yield and higher resource use efficiency obtained with this treatment. At the lower P rates, both rice types translocated more P from vegetative tissues to grains, which led to a better PUE. Molecular analysis show that plant hormones (IAA, gibberellins, cytokinins and ABA) and members of the OsPht1 family are also involved in the regulation of P homeostasis under AWD irrigation. Our results demonstrate that AWD irrigation can also enhance PUE for the rice in the field.
[4]: China's grain basket in the North China Plain is threatened by increasing water scarcity and there is an urgent need to develop water-saving irrigation strategies. Water savings in rice can be realized by alternate wetting and drying (AWD) under lowland conditions, or by aerobic rice in which the crop is grown under nonflooded conditions with supplemental irrigation. Field experimentation and simulation modelling are a powerful combination to understand complex crop-water interactions and to extrapolate site-specific empirical results to other environments and conditions. In this paper, we present results from 4 years of field experiments on AWD and aerobic rice in 2001-2004 near Kaifeng, Henan Province, China. The experimental data were used to parameterize and evaluate the rice growth model ORYZA2000. A subsequent paper reports on the extrapolation of the experimental results using ORYZA2000 and on farmer-participatory testing of aerobic rice. In the lowland area of the study site, rice yields under flooded conditions were around 8000 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> with 900 mm total (rain, irrigation) water input. Irrigation water savings were 40-70% without any yield loss by applying AWD. In the upland area of the study site, aerobic rice yielded 2400-3600 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, using 750-1100 mm total water input. ORYZA2000 satisfactorily reproduced the dynamics in measured crop variables (biomass, leaf area, N uptake) and soil water variables (ponded water depth, soil water tension). The root mean square error of predicted yield was 11% for lowland rice and 19% for aerobic rice, which was only one and a half times the error in the measured values. We concluded that ORYZA2000 is sufficiently accurate to extrapolate our results on AWD and aerobic rice to different management and environmental conditions in our study area. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

i_1233,"Management: The management of MPE in breast cancer patients includes various interventions such as thoracentesis, pleurodesis, and the use of indwelling pleural catheters .","Malignant pleural effusion is a common and debilitating complication of advanced malignant diseases. This problem seems to affect particularly those with lung and breast cancer, contributing to the poor quality of life. Approximately half of all patients with metastatic cancer develop a malignant pleural effusion at some point, which is likely to cause significant symptoms such as dyspnea and cough. Evacuation of the pleural fluid and prevention of its re-accumulation are the main goals of management. Optimal treatment is controversial and there is no universally standard approach. Intervention options range from observation in the case of asymptomatic effusions through simple thoracentesis to more invasive methods such as chemical and mechanical pleurodesis, pleur-X catheter drainage, pleuroperitoneal shunting, and pleurectomy. The best results are reported with thoracoscopy and talc insufflation, with an acceptable morbidity. Development of novel methods to control malignant pleural effusion should be a high priority in palliative care of cancer patients. This article reviews the current, as well as, novel approaches that show some promise for the future. The aim is to identify the proper approach for each individual patient.
[8]: Rationale: Placement of an indwelling pleural catheter is an established modality for symptom relief and pleurodesis in the treatment of malignant pleural effusion. Concerns remain regarding possible infectious complications, risk of hemorrhage, and the rate of pleurodesis with the use of pleural catheters in the treatment of hematologic malignancies. Objectives: The goals of our study were: (1) to evaluate the safety and cumulative incidence of pleurodesis with indwelling pleural catheters for patients with hematologic malignancies, and (2) to evaluate overall survival of this cohort of patients with pleural effusions. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 172 patients with a hematologic malignancy who underwent placement of an indwelling pleural catheter between September 1997 and August 2011 at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. A competing risk model analysis was used for complications and pleurodesis. Analysis was based on each patient's first intrapleural catheter. Results: There were 172 patients with lymphoma (58%), acute (16%) or chronic leukemia (16%), or multiple myeloma (10%). The effusions were characterized as malignant (85.5%), infectious (4.1%), volume overload (4.7%), or therapy-related (4.7%). Chylothorax was found in 20.1%. Pleural biopsies were obtained from 13 patients. The cumulative incidence of all complications was 13.6%, and the cumulative incidence of all significant catheter-related complications was 9.5%. The incidence of empyema was 2.9%, and major bleeding (requiring transfusion or intervention) was 1.7%. Thirty-day procedure-associated mortality was 0.6%. The cumulative incidence of pleurodesis at 180 days was 50%, with amedian time to pleurodesis of 81 days for the entire cohort. Conclusions: Indwelling pleural catheters appear to be safe for patients with hematologic malignancies. Complications and the cumulative incidence of pleurodesis are comparable to those reported for patients with solid organ malignancies.
[9]: OBJECTIVE: Malignant Pleural Effusion (MPE) carries significant morbidity and mortality. Indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are established in the management pathway. Large case reviews add to the evidence base regarding safety and efficacy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 168 patients had an IPC inserted between January 2012 and December 2018 in a large pleural centre. Data on outcomes and complications were obtained from the patients' notes, laboratory and radio-graphic findings. A descriptive statistical methodology was applied. RESULTS: 168 IPCs were inserted in a predominantly male population. The overall complication rate is 13%. The incidence of any individual complication such as infection, metastatic seeding, drain displacement, and loculations are all less than previously described. CONCLUSIONS: This case review adds to the large body of evidence that IPCs are safe and have minimal complications. Specific factors enabling this are the use of pre-operative antibiotics, the use of theatre space, and the experience of the pleural interventional physicians."
i_1312,"Challenges and Considerations: Interference Management: The introduction of D2D services in LTE networks can cause interference, which needs to be managed effectively to maintain system performance .","Due to the development of mobile transmission techniques, more exciting services can be launched that may change our daily lives in more easy and comfortable ways. The introduction of device-to-device (D2D) service in future 5G communication systems can extend the service coverage of intelligent medical treatment from hospitals to anywhere inside the network coverage area, which can save precious time and medical resources. As one of the key techniques in a 5G system, D2D technology has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry due to its system performance improvement, user experience enhancement and service extension. However, the introduction of D2D service will tremendously pollute the system transmission environment due to the induced interference, especially in the downlink direction where the interferer is very strong. This situation brings new challenges for effective and green resource utilization. To solve this problem, a green spectrum resource allocation strategy based on the Hungarian method is proposed in this paper to optimize system spectrum efficiency while considering the fairness among users under the assumption that all resources are fully shared by traditional cellular and newly introduced D2D users. To validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, a system-level Monte Carlo simulation is also conducted, which shows the favorable performance of the proposed algorithm over the traditional greedy algorithm."
s_1141,"Clinical Manifestations: Gastrointestinal Symptoms: While common symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal pain, and bloating, it is often assumed that malabsorption always leads to nutritional deficiencies, which may not be the case for all patients .","Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the permanent inflammation of the small bowel, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. It is associated with a number of symptoms, the most common being gastrointestinal. The prevalence of this illness worldwide is 1%. One of the main problems of CD is its difficulty to be diagnosed due to the various presentations of the disease. Besides, in many cases, CD is asymptomatic. Celiac disease is a multifactorial disease, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes are predisposition factors. Nowadays, molecular markers are being studied as diagnostic tools. In this review, we explore CD from its basic concept, manifestations, types, current and future methods of diagnosis, and associated disorders. Before addressing the therapeutic approaches, we also provide a brief overview of CD genetics and treatment.
[9]: Celiac disease is a malabsorptive disorder resulting from intolerance to gluten and leads to systemic problems due to nutritional deficiencies. Enhanced diagnostic ability through serology has led to the understanding that it is more common than previously thought and often presents in atypical and subclinical forms. Clinicians must recognize the subtle presentations that may represent celiac disease, as well as at-risk populations, so that appropriate measures can be taken to diagnose and treat the disorder.
[10]: Introduction. Celiac disease, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy, can be defined as a persistent intolerance of wheat gliadins and other cereal prolamines in the small intestinal mucosa of genetically susceptible individuals. The clinical picture of the disease can often be misleading because it varies greatly from patient to patient, resulting in delayed diagnosis.To analyze the clinical case of a child with celiac disease and acquired ichthyosis. Results. The disease, until a final diagnosis was established, had a severe course due to gastrointestinal and dermatological disorders. From the age of 1.5 years, the child had frequent diarrhea, bloating, which is why she was repeatedly hospitalized in the hospital at the place of residence. However, there was no effect from the ongoing therapeutic measures, and other symptoms such as vomiting, peripheral edema, deficiency of height and weight, and severe peeling of the skin joined in. The diagnosis was finally confirmed at the age of 2.5 years after the test for antibodies to tissue transglutaminase IgA (fifty-fold excess relative to the norm). A genetic study revealed alleles of genes responsible for predisposition to celiac disease. The results of a biopsy of the mucous membrane of the duodenum had signs of atrophy, lymphoid infiltration, corresponding to a lesion of the small intestine according to the classification Marsh III. Microscopic examination of the skin – hyperkeratosis with a decrease in the granular layer. On the basis of the obtained data, the diagnosis was made: Celiac disease, active phase, severe course, complicated by proteinenergy insufficiency severe degree, exudative enteropathy syndrome, 2 degree anemia, concomitant diagnosis: acquired ichthyosis. The girl was prescribed a gluten-free diet, and symptomatic drug therapy was carried out. In dynamics, the condition has improved. After 6 months, at the second visit, gastrointestinal and skin symptoms were absent, physical development was age-appropriate. Conclusions. The classic form of celiac disease usually manifests itself with several major symptoms, such as diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, and nutritional deficiencies. In this article we wanted to talk about a rare combination of celiac disease with ichthyosis, therefore, practitioners should be wary of a combination of skin and gastrointestinal symptoms."

It is argued that the potential for the electric vehicle will be stunted without adequate attention being paid to standards, not only in terms of the speed of its uptake and smoothness of this transition, but also in terms of maintaining compatibility between jurisdictions, safety of the public, and helping to ensure environmental sustainability. We highlight a number of areas where new or adaptations of current standards, training and certification may be needed, notably in terms of batteries and charging infrastructures, electricity distribution and accounting for the environmental characteristics of this electricity, and different aspects of vehicle-to-grid and smart grid technologies. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
[2]: Transportation is responsible for a substantial fraction of worldwide energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions and is the largest sector after energy production. However, while emissions from other sectors are generally decreasing, those from transportation have increased since 1990. Reducing the impact of transportation is a task that is inherently associated with the improvement of energy efficiency, particularly for passenger cars that contribute to almost half of the whole sector.
[3]: The transportation sector is recognized as one of the several sources of environmental problems produced by human activity in the U.S., according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The U.S. plays an outsized role: research shows that 45% of the world's automotive CO2 emissions come from automobiles in the U.S. Because of the pollutant emissions of internal combustion engines, the transportation sector is the main producer of greenhouse gas emissions. Researchers have considered technological solutions such as eco-driving to solve such problems. Eco-driving reduces excessive fuel consumption and greenhouse emissions by adjusting or enhancing drivers' behaviors such as maintaining a steady speed, avoiding heavy acceleration and deceleration, anticipating the traffic flow ahead, and minimizing idling time. Several countries implemented eco-driving and demonstrated its efficient results; depending on the type of vehicle, the fuel consumption savings can be up to 30%. Implementing an eco-driving system that displays information such as average fuel efficiency and instantaneous acceleration results in a short-term reduction in fuel consumption. The result of a study using a driving simulator showed that faster but shorter acceleration/deceleration is more fuel-efficient than milder but longer acceleration/deceleration when compared over the same time span."
i_2287,"Nutrient Cycling and Soil Structure: Nutrient Absorption: AM fungi improve plant growth by enhancing nutrient uptake, especially phosphorus (P), through their extensive hyphal networks . This symbiotic relationship allows plants to access nutrients more efficiently.","[8] The application of organic amendments to saline-alkaline soil has been recommended as an agricultural strategy to improve crop productivity and soil health. However, there has been limited research on how organic soil amendment strategies affect the health of oats and their associated rhizosphere fungal communities in saline-alkaline conditions. Thus, the objectives of this study were to understand the effects of oat cultivars with contrasting saline-alkaline tolerances and different amendments on plant morphologies, root exudates (soluble sugars and organic acids), and rhizosphere fungal communities in a saline-alkaline environment. Experiments were conducted on a saline-alkaline tolerant cultivar, Baiyan2, and a saline-alkaline sensitive cultivar, Caoyou1, under four different organic amendment strategies: 1. control (no amendment application), 2. bio-fertilizer application, 3. rotten straw application, and 4. a co-application of bio-fertilizer and rotten straw. Results showed that plant morphological characters of Baiyan2 were better than Caoyou1, and that soluble sugar and organic acid levels in the rhizosphere of Baiyan2 were significantly lower than Caoyou1. Compared to the control, oat root and plant development was significantly improved by the combined bio-fertilizer and rotten straw amendment. Bio-fertilizer application promoted malic and citric acid levels, contributing to a higher total organic acid level, and significantly increased the abundance of Rhizopus arrhizus and decreased the abundance of the fungal pathogens Alternaria, Cladosporium, Sarocladium and Heydenia of Ascomycota in both oat cultivars. All amendment treatments containing rotten straw, except the combined amendment in Baiyan2, significantly increased the relative abundance of Ascomycota (specifically Gibberella, Talaromyces, Fusarium, and Bipolaris) and decreased the relative abundance of R. arrhizus by reducing soluble sugar and organic acid levels. For the combined amendment in Baiyan2, there were no significant changes in Gibberella and Rhizopus between the control and amendment treatment. Our results suggest that co-application of bio-fertilizer and rotten straw, combined with a tolerant oat cultivar, is an effective method to increase crop productivity and enhance soil health in a saline-alkaline environment."

s_1551,"Temperature Sensitivity: Lettuce varieties have different responses to temperature, which affects their bolting time. High temperatures can inhibit seed germination and delay bolting. For instance, some lettuce genotypes can germinate at high temperatures (up to 34°C), while others are inhibited at temperatures above 31°C . This temperature sensitivity can impact the timing of bolting.","Thermoinhibition of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) seed germination is a common problem associated with lettuce production. Depending on lettuce cultivars, seed germination may be inhibited when temperatures exceed 28 °C. The delay or inhibition of seed germination at high temperatures may reduce seedling emergence and stand establishment of lettuce in the field, leading to a reduction in economic yield. To identify heat-tolerant lettuce genotypes, lettuce varieties and germplasm accessions were screened for the ability to germinate under high-temperature stress. Twenty-four to 26 genotypes were selected from each lettuce types (crisphead, romaine, butterhead, loose leaf, and wild species) and their seeds were placed in petri dishes to test their ability to germinate at high temperatures (29 and 34 °C) as compared with controls at 24 °C. Some lettuce genotypes showed thermotolerance to 34 °C (less than 20% reduction in germination) such as Elizabeth, PI 342533, PI 358025, Florida Buttercrisp, Kordaat, Corsair, FL 50105, PRO 425, PI 278070, Noemie, Picarde, Gaillarde, L. serriola (PI 491112, UC96US23, PI 491147), L. virosa (PI 274378 D), L. saligna (PI 491159), and primitive (PI 187238 A, PI 289063 C). The germination rates were consistent with the germination percentage at the high temperatures. Seed germination in the field was very low and positively correlated with seed germination at 29 and 34 °C. The highest field germination percentages (greater than 40%) were observed in Belluro, Mantilia, Mid Queen, Headmaster, PRO 874, PRO 425, FL 50105, Corsair, Romaine SSC 1148, Romaine Romea, Green Forest, Grenadier, FL 43007, Squadron, Xena, Noemie, Green Wave, Picarde, and Red Giant. The results of this study indicated that lettuce genotypes differ greatly in their ability to germinate at high temperatures as determined by the percentages and the rates of germination. Our research indicates that thermoinsensitive varieties could be used to expand lettuce production seasons in warm and low land cost areas and reduce the need for seed priming, lowering the production costs. The information may also be useful for growers to better choose cultivars for warm environments and for lettuce breeders to improve the crop for adaptation to global warming and climate change.
[4]: Seed thermoinhibition (inhibition of germination at warm temperatures) can reduce seedling emergence and stand establishment of cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) when soil temperatures are warm (>25°C) at planting. Genetic variation for high temperature germination tolerance exists among accessions of lettuce and related wild species. Seeds of a L. serriola accession (UC96US23) germinated 100% up to 37°C, while seeds of L. sativa 'Salinas' were completely inhibited from germinating at temperatures above 31°C. A recombinant inbred line population, developed from a cross between 'Salinas' and UC96US23, was analyzed for germination capacity at high temperatures. A major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for high temperature germination (Htg6.1) and additional QTL having smaller effects were identified. Near-isogenic lines confirmed the effect of Htg6.1 and are being utilized for further fine-mapping of the locus. Candidate genes associated with seed dormancy have been mapped to test for co-localization with thermoinhibition QTL. Expression patterns of candidate genes, particularly those associated with gibberellin and abscisic acid synthesis and metabolism, have also been analyzed in relation to genotype and germination temperature. Combined genetic and molecular analyses hold promise for elucidating the physiological regulation of thermoinhibition and for developing lettuce cultivars with enhanced stand establishment of warm temperature plantings."
i_386,"Healthcare: Medical Diagnostics: AI technologies, including deep learning and computer vision, are used for diagnosing diseases, analyzing medical images, and personalizing treatment plans .","Artificial intelligence (AI) has successfully made its way into contemporary industrial sectors such as automobiles, defense, industrial automation 4.0, healthcare technologies, agriculture, and many other domains because of its ability to act autonomously without continuous human interventions. However, this capability requires processing huge amounts of learning data to extract useful information in real time. The buzz around AI is not new, as this term has been widely known for the past half century. In the 1960s, scientists began to think about machines acting more like humans, which resulted in the development of the first natural language processing computers. It laid the foundation of AI, but there were only a handful of applications until the 1990s due to limitations in processing speed, memory, and computational power available. Since the 1990s, advancements in computer architecture and memory organization have enabled microprocessors to deliver much higher performance. Simultaneously, improvements in the understanding and mathematical representation of AI gave birth to its subset, referred to as machine learning (ML). ML includes different algorithms for independent learning, and the most promising ones are based on brain-inspired techniques classified as artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs have subsequently evolved to have deeper and larger structures and are often characterized as deep neural networks (DNN) and convolution neural networks (CNN). In tandem with the emergence of multicore processors, ML techniques started to be embedded in a range of scenarios and applications. Recently, application-specific instruction-set architecture for AI applications has also been supported in different microprocessors. Thus, continuous improvement in microprocessor capabilities has reached a stage where it is now possible to implement complex real-time intelligent applications like computer vision, object identification, speech recognition, data security, spectrum sensing, etc. This paper presents an overview on the evolution of AI and how the increasing capabilities of microprocessors have fueled the adoption of AI in a plethora of application domains. The paper also discusses the upcoming trends in microprocessor architectures and how they will further propel the assimilation of AI in our daily lives."
s_379,Construction Methods: Techniques vary from automated extraction and user contributions in open KGs to sophisticated methods like meta-paths and multi-omics data integration in heterogeneous and biomedical KGs .,"Heterogeneous knowledge graphs (KGs) have enabled the modeling of complex systems, from genetic interaction graphs and protein-protein interaction networks to networks representing drugs, diseases, proteins, and side effects. Analytical methods for KGs rely on quantifying similarities between entities, such as nodes, in the graph. However, such methods must consider the diversity of node and edge types contained within the KG via, for example, defined sequences of entity types known as meta-paths. We present metapaths, the first R software package to implement meta-paths and perform meta-path-based similarity search in heterogeneous KGs. The metapaths package offers various built-in similarity metrics for node pair comparison by querying KGs represented as either edge or adjacency lists, as well as auxiliary aggregation methods to measure set-level relationships. Indeed, evaluation of these methods on an open-source biomedical KG recovered meaningful drug and disease-associated relationships, including those in Alzheimer's disease. The metapaths framework facilitates the scalable and flexible modeling of network similarities in KGs with applications across KG learning.
[5]: Biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs), which can help with the understanding of complex biological systems and pathologies, have begun to play a critical role in medical practice and research. However, challenges remain in their embedding and use due to their complex nature and the specific demands of their construction. Existing studies often suffer from problems such as sparse and noisy datasets, insufficient modeling methods and non-uniform evaluation metrics. In this work, we established a comprehensive KG system for the biomedical field in an attempt to bridge the gap. Here, we introduced PharmKG, a multi-relational, attributed biomedical KG, composed of more than 500 000 individual interconnections between genes, drugs and diseases, with 29 relation types over a vocabulary of ~8000 disambiguated entities. Each entity in PharmKG is attached with heterogeneous, domain-specific information obtained from multi-omics data, i.e. gene expression, chemical structure and disease word embedding, while preserving the semantic and biomedical features. For baselines, we offered nine state-of-The-Art KG embedding (KGE) approaches and a new biological, intuitive, graph neural network-based KGE method that uses a combination of both global network structure and heterogeneous domain features. Based on the proposed benchmark, we conducted extensive experiments to assess these KGE models using multiple evaluation metrics. Finally, we discussed our observations across various downstream biological tasks and provide insights and guidelines for how to use a KG in biomedicine. We hope that the unprecedented quality and diversity of PharmKG will lead to advances in biomedical KG construction, embedding and application.

i_896,"Uses: Civil Engineering: Rotordynamics principles are applied in the design of vibration control systems for structures, such as tuned mass dampers used in bridges and buildings to mitigate vibrations .","Impact dampers are often used in the field of civil, mechanical, and aerospace engineering for reducing structural vibrations. This research is motivated by a practical problem, that is, the reduction of wind-induced and rain-wind-induced vibrations in long, flexible and low-damping stay-cables. A new concept of distributed-mass impact damper has been proposed, designed, fabricated, and tested experimentally at Vienna University of Technology by using a 31.2-m actual stay. The results of the full-scale experiments (free-decay tests) are illustrated in this study. Because the performance of the new device was very promising, with total damping ratio three to 10 times larger than the original damping in the stay, modeling of the damper device was needed to ensure adequate practical application in the future. This study examines three different reduced-order models, derived in an attempt to characterize the complex behavior of the new device. Verification and validation of the models are carried out by comparison with the experimental results. Finally, selection of an adequate model, based on both experiments and simulations, is described and discussed.
[13]: Due to increasing dynamic actions and the trend to slender structures the damping of vibrations gains in importance. One of the effective methods to reduce vertical structural vibrations is the application of classical tuned mass dampers (TMD), which are damping the vibration response of excited natural frequencies. The areas of application reach from civil and mechanical engineering to aeronautics. In addition to part I (laboratory tests) this paper shows the first application of tuned liquid column dampers (TLCD) to a vibration-prone steel constructed railway bridge. The fluid mass is guided in a U-tube. A gas spring enables tuning of the natural damper frequency and energy dissipation is given by turbulence effects in fluid and gas flow. In case of the TLCD there are no mechanical parts for tuning necessary. At first the mechanical model of the bridge-TLCD coupled system is presented and the equation of motion is derived. Furthermore optimal tuning is performed. The considered railway bridge is analyzed numerically by a finite element model, including the modelling of the TLCD. The installation process of the TLCD to the railway bridge is described in detail and measuring results are presented. It is shown that the application of TLCD's to railway bridges effectively reduces bridge vibrations. © Ernst & Sohn Verlag für Architektur und technische Wissenschaften GmbH & Co. KG."

This method showed significant improvements in bloating scores post-treatment, suggesting its effectiveness in measuring symptom changes .","Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of a holistic acupuncture approach on nausea, pain, bloating and electrogastrogram (EGG) parameters in patients with intractable symptoms. Methods: Twelve patients with no or mild nausea (those without nausea had bloating or pain) and 10 with a history of moderate to severe nausea were referred for acupuncture. All underwent an EGG and were treated at acupuncture points PC6, SP4 and DU20. Visual analog scales (VAS) assessing severity of nausea, pain and bloating were obtained before and after acupuncture treatment. Nineteen patients received three and three patients received two treatments. Results: VAS scores for nausea reflected the clinical assessment and differed significantly between mild and moderate/severe nausea groups. Acupuncture significantly improved severity of nausea in both groups with improved pre-treatment nausea between the first and third treatments in the moderate/severe nausea group. Pain scores improved with acupuncture in the mild nausea group only and bloating improved only with the first treatment in this group. Patients with bloating with VAS scores greater than 35 pre-treatment improved with acupuncture and over all VAS scores for pain improved with treatment. Acupuncture increased the power in the 2.7 to 3.5 cpm range in the EGG. Conclusion: In this uncontrolled clinical study, a holistic acupuncture approach significantly improved nausea in patients with refractory symptoms and increased the power in the 2.7-3.5 cpm component of the electrogastrogram. Bloating and pain VAS scores improved acutely with treatment. This study suggests that acupuncture may be effective in this refractory group of patients and further study using appropriate controls is warranted. © 2007 WJG. All rights reserved."
i_2201,"Key Points on Bee Self-Medication and Plant Utilization: Self-Medication in Bees: Bees are known to use plant secondary metabolites for self-medication. For example, bumblebees infected with Crithidia bombi showed a strong preference for nectar containing nicotine, which significantly delayed the progression of gut infections .","The presence of antimicrobial secondary metabolites in nectar suggests that pollinators, which are threatened globally by emergent disease, may benefit from the consumption of nectars rich in these metabolites. We tested whether nicotine, a nectar secondary metabolite common in Solanaceae and Tilia species, is used by parasitized bumblebees as a source of self-medication , using a series of toxicological, microbiological and behavioural experiments. Caged bees infected with Crithidia bombi had a slight preference for sucrose solution laced with the alkaloid and behavioural tests showed that the parasite infection induced an increased consumption of nicotine during foraging activity, though nicotine had an appetite-reducing effect overall. When ingested, nicotine delayed the progression of a gut infection in bumblebees by a few days, but dietary nicotine did not clear the infection, and after 10 days the parasite load approached that of control bees. Moreover, when pathogens were exposed to the alkaloid prior to host ingestion, the protozoan's viability was not directly affected, suggesting that anti-parasite effects were relatively weak. Nicotine consumption in a single dose did not impose any cost even in starved bees but the alkaloid had detrimental effects on healthy bees if consistently consumed for weeks. These toxic effects disappeared in infected bees, suggesting that detoxification costs might have been counterbalanced by the advantages in slowing the progression of the infection. Nicotine consumption did not affect bee lifespan but the reduction in the parasite load may have other likely unexplored subtle benefits both for individual bees and their colony. Potential evidence for self-medication is discussed. The contention that secondary metabolites in nectar may be under selection from pollinators, or used by plants to enhance their own reproductive success, remains to be confirmed."

Classical gray level difference algorithm is improved by selective output of the result of the maximum or the minimum of the gray level with the pixels in the surrounding, and multi-structuring of neighborhood window is used to represent the essence of transition region.

[6]: Physical activity is vital for overall health maintenance, particularly cardiovascular health. Additionally, physical activity is important for decreasing the risk of cancer and osteoporosis in women. Physical fitness, a benefit of physical activity, is important during pregnancy and postpartum periods for both women and their babies. As women became more aware of this issue, their participation in physical activity increased. Upon becoming pregnant, many women posed their Ob/Gyn physicians with the question, ""is physical activity during pregnancy safe?"" Initially, little was known about the effects physical activity had on the expectant mother or fetal development. Research has led to a better understanding of maternal and fetal physiology and findings highlight the importance of physical activity during this time. This chapter provides an overview, which examines aspects of physical activity in regard to pregnant and lactating women. Based on the available literature, physicians have shifted their focus from assuring patients that physical activity during gestation is safe to encouraging physical activity during pregnancy because of the potential benefits to both the fetus and mother. Ultimately, these benefits are realized at labor and delivery and during the mother's recovery period. Current research into the fetal and neonatal benefits of maternal physical activity is explored. Lactation represents a continuation of the pregnancy, as the mother continues to supply nourishment for her infant. The effects of physical activity during lactation are viewed from the maternal and infant perspective. As research advances, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines continue to reflect these gains in information. Lastly, the chapter expresses what has been done, and what is currently being done to encourage women to stay physically active throughout their reproductive lifespan. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

i_1604,"The presence of salt marshes contributes to surface elevation changes, which can counteract the effects of rising sea levels. Vegetated areas show greater surface elevation increases compared to non-vegetated areas, highlighting the importance of salt marsh vegetation in maintaining coastal stability .","Guo, Y.; Chen, Y.; Liao, B.; Huang, B.; Wu, F., and Jiang, Z., 2020. The effect of vegetation on surface elevation in coastal mangrove areas. Journal of Coastal Research, 36(3), 600-607. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. Rising sea levels pose a serious threat to global coastal mangroves. The ability of surface elevation to change synchronously with rising sea level is the key to the survival of mangroves. Mangrove vegetation can have a variety of effects on surface and subsurface processes; therefore, it has an important role in surface elevation changes. In this study, rod surface elevation table-marker horizon (RSET-MH) technology was used to study changes in surface elevation and accretion between nonvegetated and vegetated mangrove areas at three different sites. The results showed that the existence of vegetation had a significant effect on elevation changes, with increased surface elevation in vegetation areas observed to be significantly greater than those in nonvegetation areas. In addition, the subsurface changes in vegetated area showed expansion, whereas the nonvegetation area showed subsidence. Surface accretion showed variable trends in different research sites, although these could be related to their geographical location and thus be affected by many factors. Moreover, there was a significant correlation between density of vegetation and elevation/subsurface changes (r = 0.763, p < 0.05; r = 0.714, p < 0.05 respectively), and there were no significant correlations between accretion and vegetation characteristics. The results indicate that mangrove vegetation has a positive effect on the increase of surface elevation, and vegetation density may be a key factor because of the high biomass and carbon storage rate in high-density areas. This study provides additional data with which to explore the elevation variation in mangroves and a scientific basis and technical support for strengthening wetland protection."

i_2352,4. Quality Control and Assurance: Contamination Checks: Regularly perform contamination checks using both traditional culture methods and advanced techniques like real-time PCR to ensure the purity of the strains .,"Cell therapy products represent a new trend of treatment in the field of immunotherapy and regenerative medicine. Their biological nature and multistep preparation procedure require the application of complex release criteria and quality control. Microbial contamination of cell therapy products is a potential source of morbidity in recipients. The automated blood culture systems are widely used for the detection of microorganisms in cell therapy products. However the standard 2-week cultivation period is too long for some cell-based treatments and alternative methods have to be devised. We tried to verify whether a shortened cultivation of the supernatant from the mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) culture obtained 2 days before the cell harvest could sufficiently detect microbial growth and allow the release of MSC for clinical application. We compared the standard Ph. Eur. cultivation method and the automated blood culture system BACTEC (Becton Dickinson). The time to detection (TTD) and the detection limit were analyzed for three bacterial and two fungal strains. The Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were recognized within 24 h with both methods (detection limit ~10 CFU). The time required for the detection of Bacillus subtilis was shorter with the automated method (TTD 10.3 vs. 60 h for 10–100 CFU). The BACTEC system reached significantly shorter times to the detection of Candida albicans and Aspergillus brasiliensis growth compared to the classical method (15.5 vs. 48 and 31.5 vs. 48 h, respectively; 10–100 CFU). The positivity was demonstrated within 48 h in all bottles, regardless of the size of the inoculum. This study validated the automated cultivation system as a method able to detect all tested microorganisms within a 48-h period with a detection limit of ~10 CFU. Only in case of B. subtilis, the lowest inoculum (~10 CFU) was not recognized. The 2-day cultivation technique is then capable of confirming the microbiological safety of MSC and allows their timely release for clinical application.
[8]: Advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) are required to maintain their quality and safety throughout the production cycle, and they must be free of microbial contaminations. Among them, mycoplasma contaminations are difficult to detect and undesirable in ATMP, especially for immunosuppressed patients. Mycoplasma detection tests suggested by European Pharmacopoeia are the ""culture method"" and ""indicator cell culture method"" which, despite their effectiveness, are time consuming and laborious. Alternative methods are accepted, provided they are adequate and their results are comparable with those of the standard methods. To validate a novel in-house method, we performed and optimized, a real time PCR protocol, using a commercial kit and an automatic extraction system, in which we tested different volumes of matrix, maximizing the detection sensitivity. The results were compared with those obtained with the gold standard methods. From a volume of 10 ml, we were able to recognize all the mycoplasmas specified by the European Pharmacopoeia, defined as genomic copies per colony forming unit ratio (GC/CFU). Our strategy allows to achieve faster and reproducible results when compared with conventional methods and meets the sensitivity and robustness criteria required for an alternative approach to mycoplasmas detection for in-process and product-release testing of ATMP."

The Negro River exhibits extremely low Rrs values (<0.005 sr<sup>-1</sup> at visible and near-infrared bands) due to the elevated absorption of coloured dissolved organic matter (aCDOM at 440 nm > 7 m<sup>-1</sup>) caused by the high amount of dissolved organic carbon (DOC > 7 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) and low SSC (<5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). Interannual variability of Rrs is primarily controlled by the input of suspended sediments from the Branco River, which is a clear water river that governs the changes in the apparent optical properties of the Negro River, even at distances that are greater than 90 km from its mouth. Better results were obtained using the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band (Band 4 at 665 nm) in order to estimate the SSC, with an R<sup>2</sup> value greater than 0.85 and an error less than 20% in the adjusted models. The magnitudes of water reflectance in the Sentinel-2 MSI Red band were consistent with in situ Rrs measurements, indicating the large spatial variability of the lower SSC values (0 to 15 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) in a complex anabranching reach of the Negro River. The in situ and satellite data analysed in this study indicates sedimentation processes in the lower Negro River near the Amazon River. The results suggest that the radiometric characteristics of sensors, like sentinel-2 MSI, are suitable for monitoring the suspended sediment concentration in large tropical black-water rivers."
s_1848,"Interaction Between Biochemistry and Architecture: The combined effects of leaf biochemistry and canopy architecture can be modeled using radiative transfer models like PROSAIL, which link spectral variation to both biochemical contents and canopy structure, suggesting that these models can fully capture all interactions in forest ecosystems .","Vegetation biochemistry is a critical driver of the forest carbon and water cycle and the fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. As result, monitoring biochemistry is a key to improving our estimates of the terrestrial carbon and energy budget. While destructive sampling techniques have been widely applied to determine nutrient content in foliage, scaling of these measurements to the stand and landscape is challenging. As an alternative to traditional field-based approaches, optical remote sensing is a powerful technique for sampling biochemical constituents in a spatially continuous fashion. Remote sensing of biochemical constituents is based on the understanding that leaf biochemistry is closely linked to absorption and reflectance properties in characteristic, often spectrally narrow, wavebands. Spectral absorption features can be identified to characterize and quantify biochemical properties at the leaf, stand and landscape level. At the same time, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) remote sensing can allow inference about the impact of leaf biochemistry on tree growth and canopy structure. In this study, we report the effect of nitrogen-fertilization of a Douglas-fir dominated forest on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada using active and passive remote sensing techniques. Leaf pigment concentrations were estimated from inversion of a canopy reflectance model (PROSAIL) and canopy nitrogen (N) was inferred from an airborne imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS). The impact of leaf biochemistry on canopy structure and tree growth was then investigated using a temporal sequence of LiDAR data acquired two years before, and after, the fertilization treatment. Results indicate that while fertilization had a significant impact on canopy pigment concentrations, it did not impact canopy nitrogen. A notable increase in tree growth was found for younger stands of less than 15. m of height, but not for more mature stand with taller trees. Fertilization had no immediate impact on canopy density measured from LiDAR derived leaf area and canopy volume. The use of advanced remote sensing tools and techniques such as those demonstrated in this study can be a powerful addition to ongoing efforts to model carbon and water fluxes throughout the landscape. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.
[8]: The combined PROSPECT leaf optical properties model and SAIL canopy bidirectional reflectance model, also referred to as PROSAIL, has been used for about sixteen years to study plant canopy spectral and directional reflectance in the solar domain. PROSAIL has also been used to develop new methods for retrieval of vegetation biophysical properties. It links the spectral variation of canopy reflectance, which is mainly related to leaf biochemical contents, with its directional variation, which is primarily related to canopy architecture and soil/vegetation contrast. This link is key to simultaneous estimation of canopy biophysical/structural variables for applications in agriculture, plant physiology, or ecology, at different scales. PROSAIL has become one of the most popular radiative transfer tools due to its ease of use, general robustness, and consistent validation by lab/field/space experiments over the years. However, PROSPECT and SAIL are still evolving: they have undergone recent improvements both at the leaf and the plant levels. This paper provides an extensive review of the PROSAIL developments in the context of canopy biophysics and radiative transfer modeling. © 2009 Elsevier Inc."

Workforce Development: While a qualified and well-trained cybersecurity workforce is often cited as essential for mitigating and responding to cybersecurity threats, it is likely that simply identifying critical roles and recruiting cybersecurity talent may not significantly impact overall security outcomes .","In overviewing this critical topic as it relates to public sector human resource management, this chapter describes the major components of institutional approaches to cybersecurity, with a particular focus on the human resource management dynamic of such efforts. It highlights noteworthy data breaches and, using recent guidance, describes contemporary challenges and strategies for public sector organizations seeking to strengthen their security networks. In particular, the framework is intended for use in improving practices around identifying, recruiting, developing, and retaining cybersecurity talent, including those whose primary focus is on cybersecurity as well as those who need specific cybersecurity-related knowledge and skills in order to manage risks to the enterprise. Collectively, the NICE framework supports, among others, employers seeking to engage in cybersecurity workforce planning efforts, individuals seeking career paths in cybersecurity, and human resource management/development professionals building cybersecurity training programs.
[6]: The security of federal information systems and data is critical to the nation's safety, prosperity, and well-being. However, federal systems and networks are inherently at risk because of their complexity, technological diversity, and geographic dispersion. Further, threats to federal information technology (IT) infrastructure continue to grow in number and sophistication, posing a risk to the reliable functioning of our government. A key component of the government's ability to mitigate and respond to cybersecurity threats is having a qualified, well-trained cybersecurity workforce. The objectives of chapter 1 are to determine the extent to which federal agencies have assigned work roles for positions performing IT, cybersecurity, or cyber-related functions and describe the steps federal agencies took to identify work roles of critical need. As reported in chapter 2, DHS has identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. Chapter 3 assessed whether: OPM developed a coding structure and procedures for assigning codes to cybersecurity positions and submitted a progress report to Congress; CFO Act agencies submitted complete, reliable baseline assessments of their cybersecurity workforces; and CFO Act agencies established procedures to assign codes to cybersecurity positions."

This risk is amplified in today's interconnected global economy. Incorporation of crisis and disaster management into hospitality firms' strategic planning is essential if such risk is to be minimized. Critical factors to be considered in planning for the strategic management of crises and disasters include leadership, communication and media relationships, market reconstruction and the development of integrated networks, incorporating the stakeholders and first responders likely to be impacted by a crisis and/or disaster scenario.

[11] In olden days, world has Pandemic with a series of disasters, such as Earthquakes, Tsunamis, floods, fire accidents, gas leakages, Cyclones, Hurricane which have severely impact the world .All disasters impact leads to lot of losses for the human lives economically and socially. In all the situations of emergency management, disaster prone geospatial data can be processed accurately with latest tools and techniques that have a very great achievement to get quick services from the rescue team that help save human lives, limit damage, and reduce the economic loss. To improve disaster management activities and predicting risk mitigation and recovery techniques is one of the familiar priorities considered, caused by nature calamities and littlie bit man made nature calamities. The effectiveness of any technology integration with geospatial data is as much about the human systems in which it is embedded as about the technology itself. Map assessment, geo referencing places a very important role to assess the status of the use of geospatial data, tools, techniques and infrastructure in disaster management, and recommends and analyzing various ways to increase and improve their use during emergency situations. The main objective of this research is extract Multispectral data and find hazard prone areas and make the society to get more awareness about major disasters and prepare them to make sustainable actions at hazard situations and reduce the risk and save the lives of humans and reduce the economic loss of public .This research focus on how to effectively capture the disaster prone information continuously and improve situational awareness and alert the public with good decision making policies. It is mainly concentrate on how to provide recovery services to the users in an efficient manner and also apply different Data mining and machine learning and deep learning algorithms to process data and provide alert services and early warning system to the decision making team to perform appropriate rescue operations with reference of past experienced disaster data. This research explores emergency planning, response and effective decision making and also extract various hidden features from multispectral satellite image data with current trends. [16] This investigation frames volcano disaster potentialities for the US Pacific Northwest by assessing the interaction of the region's growing population and affiliated housing development with volcanic hazards. Changes in human and residential exposure to the hazards are measured for a period of 1940 through 2100 by employing fine-scale (100 m) historical, current, and forecast demographic data derived from a spatial allocation model. Forecast population and housing unit density data from the model are based on societal change scenarios generated by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This ensemble approach reveals variations and uncertainties in the future hazard exposures, illustrating an envelope of volcano disaster possibilities. The demographic data are evaluated using a three-step, worst-case, downscaling approach by first calculating possible regional impacts before measuring volcano proximal and, thereafter, local hazard consequences. Results indicate that the Northwest regional study area is forecast to experience as much as a 445 % increase in total population and 1336 % amplification in housing unit counts from 1940 to 2100. The Mount Rainier proximal and local hazard analyses reveal the greatest overall increase in the total population and housing units for the entire period of record, whereas the Glacier Peak proximal and local hazard zone are forecast to experience the greatest percentage increase in population and housing units. These findings may be used by emergency managers, land planners, insurers, decision makers, and the public to discover changes in volcanic hazard risk and exposure within their communities, as well as assess potential mitigation and sustainability options."

Lipid oxidation, juice loss, color and flavor deterioration, and microorganism propagation occur during the thawing process, which may result in the deteriorated meat quality. Consequently, it is necessary to utilize proper thawing methods to maintain meat quality and minimize the losses. The novel thawing technology includes microwave, ultrasonic, high-voltage electrostatic field, and vacuum thawing, etc. It depends on the e-quipment that is different from the traditional thawing method. Compared with the traditional thawing method, the new ones are characterized by fast thawing speed, low energy consumption, and better maintenance of the meat quality. The present mini-review described different kinds of thawing methods, their advantages and disadvantages. This review will hopefully provide theoretical insight and practical guidance for enterprises to choose the appropriate thawing technology.

s_1269,"Training and Vigilance: Ongoing training and education for anesthesia providers are essential to keep up with new drugs, techniques, and safety protocols .","[8] Drug medication errors remain a major safety issue in anaesthesia and intensive care, and prevention measures need to be strengthened. This is why the French Society of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care and the French Society of Clinical Pharmacy have profoundly reviewed their previous recommendations published in 2007. The 2017 recommendations are based on the literature but also on feedback from field professionals targeting patient safety. They share many similarities with recommendations issued from other countries (European countries, North America and Australia in particular) on this subject. Specific measures to prevent preparation, reconstitution and administration errors are detailed. Medical products using small bore connectors specified in the ISO 80369 series allow the prevention of administrtion errors. Specific labeling should be used according to an international color-coding of syringes, routes of administration, preparation bags, PCAs and PCEAs, trolleys or drug storage devices. A risk mapping must be established a priori and medication errors reporting is imperative in order to analyze them a posteriori in departmental meetings (REMED). Self-assessment, or external assessment, must be conducted. All of the proposed recommendations reinforce the culture of safety, which is essential to the practice of anaesthesia and intensive care. [11] The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. As the first organization of its kind, the APSF established patient safety as a specific aspiration and discipline, and has been instrumental in triggering the worldwide patient safety movements of the present day. Many anesthesiologists point with pride to a tenfold decline in the incidence of anesthesia-related mortality from 10–30 to 1–3 deaths per 100,000 anesthetics since the APSF's inaugural, with reductions in anesthesia-related morbidity similarly claimed. Others contend that these data are unintentionally misleading. Introduction of noninvasive oxygen saturation, end-tidal carbon dioxide and anesthetic gas concentration monitors, novel drugs and regimens, and instrumentation for airway management have made substantial contributions to improved patient safety in the interval surrounding surgery. However, new operations in new settings steadily raise new safety issues. As risks of the past are contained fresh risks have become apparent including persistent and deleterious effects of anesthetics on the nervous system at the extremes of age. Perioperative safety is profoundly influenced by corporate decision making, vicissitudes of international markets and governmental interventions that arise far from the operating room, as shortages of critical anesthetic drugs and a surfeit of awkwardly working digital recording devices attest. [12] The Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation (APSF) was created in 1985. Its founders coined the term ""patient safety"" in its modern public usage and created the very first patient safety organization, igniting a movement that is now universal in all of health care. Driven by the vision ""that no patient shall be harmed by anesthesia,"" the APSF has worked tirelessly for more than a quarter century to promote safety education and communication through its widely read Newsletter, its programs, and its presentations. The APSF's extensive research grant program has supported a great many projects leading to key safety improvements and, in particular, was central in the development of high-fidelity mannequin simulation as a research and teaching tool. With its pioneering collaboration, the APSF is unique in incorporating the talents and resources of anesthesia professionals of all types, safety scientists, pharmaceutical and equipment manufacturers, regulators, liability insurance companies, and also surgeons. Specific alerts, campaigns, discussions, and projects have targeted a host of safety issues and dangers over the years, starting with minimal intraoperative monitoring in 1986 and all the way up to beach-chair position cerebral perfusion pressure, operating room medication errors, and the extremely popular DVD on operating room fire safety in 2010; the list is long and expansive. The APSF has served as a model and inspiration for subsequent patient safety organizations and has been recognized nationally as having a dramatic positive impact on the safety of anesthesia care. Recognizing that the work is not over, that systems, organizations, and equipment still at times fail, that basic preventable human errors still do sometimes occur, and that ""production pressure"" in anesthesia practice threatens past safety gains, the APSF is firmly committed and continues to work hard both on established tenets and new patient safety principles.

s_680,"Efficiency and Fault Detection: Data-Driven Approaches: The use of big data and detailed monitoring systems allows for the development of more accurate and efficient FDAs. These systems can analyze vast amounts of data to predict and prevent potential issues, ensuring that HVAC systems operate smoothly and efficiently .","Buildings are responsible for a large portion of the overall energy consumption. With the rising penetration of renewable energies, the heating and cooling demand of buildings will be increasingly satisfied by heat pumps. However, faults in the heat pump systems reduce energy efficiency or cause system failure, leading to an increased demand for primary energy. Hence, fault detection algorithms (FDA) are used to identify faults before system failure or efficiency deterioration occurs. With the rise of artificial intelligence and big data as well as more detailed monitoring systems, data-driven FDA have become a focus of research in recent years, showing promising results with acceptable effort. However, studies often use specific training data sets, thus generating FDAs adapted to a specific experimental system. In this paper, we investigate whether FDAs trained on a fault data set gathered with a laboratory heat pump system can be deployed on a real-world application system without the need for expensive modifications. We also investigate a big data approach, in which we use data collected over an extended period of time to train the FDAs. To this end, we use a data set kindly provided by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) containing data for typical heat pump failures measured on a specially outfitted air-water heat pump. From this data, we extract a series of features as input for the FDAs and evaluate the importance of those features for the FDAs. We train the algorithms to detect faults on the NIST data set, and transfer the fitted FDAs to our own measurement data. The results show that the trained FDAs perform very well on the NIST data set, but poorly on the real-world data set. We identify several reasons for the FDAs' poor performance and derive mitigating actions. We believe that big data approaches for FDAs are facing several issues beyond the simple gathering of large data quantities, especially the labelling of occurred faults and completeness of the data set."

This method involves analyzing the residual staining from AFB1 on the kernel surface and applying principal components analysis (PCA) and factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) to differentiate contamination levels . This technique shows potential for adaptation to white rice.,"The feasibility of using a visible/near-infrared hyperspectral imaging system with a wavelength range between 400 and 1000 nm to detect and differentiate different levels of aflatoxin B<inf>1</inf> (AFB<inf>1</inf>) artificially titrated on maize kernel surface was examined. To reduce the color effects of maize kernels, image analysis was limited to a subset of original spectra (600 to 1000 nm). Residual staining from the AFB<inf>1</inf> on the kernels surface was selected as regions of interest for analysis. Principal components analysis (PCA) was applied to reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral image data, and then a stepwise factorial discriminant analysis (FDA) was performed on latent PCA variables. The results indicated that discriminant factors F<inf>2</inf> can be used to separate control samples from all of the other groups of kernels with AFB<inf>1</inf> inoculated, whereas the discriminant factors F<inf>1</inf> can be used to identify maize kernels with levels of AFB<inf>1</inf> as low as 10 ppb. An overall classification accuracy of 98% was achieved. Finally, the peaks of β coefficients of the discrimination factors F<inf>1</inf> and F<inf>2</inf> were analyzed and several key wavelengths identified for differentiating maize kernels with and without AFB<inf>1</inf>, as well as those with differing levels of AFB<inf>1</inf> inoculation. Results indicated that Vis/NIR hyperspectral imaging technology combined with the PCA-FDA was a practical method to detect and differentiate different levels of AFB<inf>1</inf> artificially inoculated on the maize kernels surface.

However, they combat diseases through a combination of their innate immune system and social defence behaviours like foraging for health-enhancing plant products (e.g. nectar, pollen and resin). Plant secondary metabolites are not only highly active against bacteria and fungi, they might even enhance selective foraging and feeding decisions in the colony. Here, we tested six major plant terpenes and their corresponding acetates, characterizing six natural Thymus vulgaris chemotypes, for their antimicrobial activity on bacteria associated with European foulbrood. Comparison of the inhibitory activity revealed the highest activity for carvacrol and thymol whereas the acetates mostly did not inhibit bacterial growth. All terpenes and acetates are present in the nectar and pollen of thyme, with pollen containing concentrations higher by several orders of magnitude. The physiological response was tested on forager and freshly emerged bees by means of antennal electroantennography. Both responded much stronger to geraniol and trans-sabinene hydrate compared to carvacrol and thymol. In conclusion, bee-forageable thyme product terpenes (mainly from pollen) yield effective antibiotic activity by reducing the growth of bee disease-associated bacteria and can be detected with different response levels by the honey bees' antennae. This is a further step forward in understanding the complex pathogen-pollinator-plant network."
s_2002,"While the substitution of wind power for coal-fired electricity may decrease global radiative forcing and temperature rise, it is likely to be the primary solution for climate change mitigation .","Background As a non-fossil technology, wind power has an enormous advantage over coal because of its role in climate change mitigation. Therefore, it is important to investigate how substituting wind power for coal-fired electricity will affect emission reductions, changes in radiative forcing and rising temperatures, particularly in the context of emission limits. Methods We developed an integrated methodology that includes two parts: an energy-economy-environmental (3E) integrated model and an emission-temperature response model. The former is used to simulate the dynamic relationships between economic output, wind energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; the latter is used to evaluate changes in radiative forcing and warming. Results Under the present development projection, wind energy cannot serve as a major force in curbing emissions, even under the strictest space-restraining scenario. China's temperature contribution to global warming will be up to 21.76% if warming is limited to 2 degrees. With the wind-for-coal power substitution, the corresponding contribution to global radiative forcing increase and temperature rise will decrease by up to 10% and 6.57%, respectively. Conclusions Substituting wind power for coal-fired electricity has positive effects on emission reductions and warming control. However, wind energy alone is insufficient for climate change mitigation. It forms an important component of the renewable energy portfolio used to combat global warming."

This study has explored the possible avenues to implement the circular economy concept in the wastewater management."
i_85,"Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): CNNs are designed to handle grid-like data, such as images, by learning spatial hierarchies of features. They are particularly effective in scenarios where the data can be represented as a grid, such as image recognition or video analysis .","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged recently as a powerful way of dealing with non-Euclidean data on graphs, such as social networks and citation networks. Despite their success, obtaining optimal graph neural networks requires immense manual work and domain knowledge. Inspired by the strong searching capability of neural architecture search in CNN, a few attempts automatically search optimal GNNs that rival the best human-invented architectures. However, existing Graph Neural Architecture Search (GNAS) approaches face two challenges: (1) Sampling GNNs across the entire search space results in low search efficiency, particularly in large search spaces. (2) It is pretty costly to evaluate GNNs by training architectures from scratch. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes an Efficient Graph Neural Architecture Search (EGNAS) method based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a prediction network. Specifically, EGNAS first uses MCTS to recursively partition the entire search space into good or bad search regions. Then, the reinforcement learning-based search strategy (also called the agent) is applied to sample GNNs in those good search regions, which prevents overly exploring complex architectures and bad-performance regions, thus improving sampling efficiency. To reduce the evaluation cost, we use a prediction network to estimate the performance of GNNs. We alternately use ground-truth accuracy (by training GNNs from scratch) and prediction accuracy (by the prediction network) to update the search strategy to avoid inaccuracies caused by long-term use of the prediction network. Furthermore, to improve the training efficiency and stability, the agent is trained by a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization. Experiments show that EGNAS can search for better GNNs in the promising search region in a shorter search time, with an accuracy of 83.5%, 73.3%, 79.6%, and 94.5% on Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, and Photo datasets, respectively In particular, compared to the most popular GNAS algorithm, our EGNAS-NP without using the prediction network achieves an accuracy of 83.6% on Cora, 73.5% on Citeseer, 79.9% on Pubmed, and 94.6% on Photo, with a relative improvement of 0.6%, 0.2%, 0.7%, and 0.6%.

s_1158,"Endothelin-1 and Electrolyte Balance: Endothelin-1's Role: Endothelin-1 increases blood pressure by promoting sodium reabsorption in the kidneys. It also stimulates aldosterone production, which acts to inhibit sodium reabsorption as a feedback mechanism. Disruption in this feedback system can lead to abnormal fluid and electrolyte handling, further affecting blood pressure .","Aldosterone increases blood pressure (BP) by stimulating sodium (Na) reabsorption within the distal nephron and collecting duct (CD). Aldosterone also stimulates endothelin-1 (ET-1) production that acts within the CD to inhibit Na reabsorption via a negative feedback mechanism. We tested the hypothesis that this renal aldosterone-endothelin feedback system regulates electrolyte balance and BP by comparing the effect of a high-salt (NaCl) diet and mineralocorticoid stimulation in control and CD-specific ET-1 knockout (CD ET-1 KO) mice. Metabolic balance and radiotelemetric BP were measured before and after treatment with desoxycorticosterone pivalate (DOCP) in mice fed a high-salt diet with saline to drink. CD ET-1 KO mice consumed more high-salt diet and saline and had greater urine output than controls. CD ET-1 KO mice exhibited increased BP and greater fluid retention and body weight than controls on a high-salt diet. DOCP with high-salt feeding further increased BP in CD ET-1 KO mice, and by the end of the study the CD ET-1 KO mice were substantially hypernatremic. Unlike controls, CD ET-1 KO mice failed to respond acutely or escape from DOCP treatment. We conclude that local ET-1 production in the CD is required for the appropriate renal response to Na loading and that lack of local ET-1 results in abnormal fluid and electrolyte handling when challenged with a high-salt diet and with DOCP treatment. Additionally, local ET-1 production is necessary, under these experimental conditions, for renal compensation to and escape from the chronic effects of mineralocorticoids.
[5]: Fluid and electrolyte balance in the human organism is controlled by aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid hormone of the suprarenal glands. The major target cells are localized in the kidney where the hormone controls transepithelial salt transport. Over the past few years, evidence has been accumulated that cells of the cardiovascular system are also targeted by the hormone. As an example, endothelial cells resemble similar mechanisms triggered by aldosterone as shown for the kidney. Although the pathological alterations induced by aldosterone excess are obvious, the physiological changes are largely unknown. On the basis of recent experiments, using atomic force microscopy as an imaging tool and a mechanical sensor, I present a hypothesis on the physiological role of aldosterone in endothelial function and its potential implications in the control of blood pressure. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."
s_1390,"Administered before surgery to shrink the tumor, followed by radical surgery  .","Treatment of cervical cancer varies depending on stage and patient factors. Comprehensive management is best provided within a well resourced multidisciplinary team. Micro-invasive disease is largely managed surgically.. Treatment for stage IA2 disease involves radical clearance around the primary disease and pelvic lymphadenectomy. Stage IB1 and non-bulky stage IIA disease can be treated with radical hysterectomy or chemoradiation. Important developments in the surgical management of patients with this stage of disease include radical trachelectomy, nerve sparing and laparoscopic techniques, and sentinel node identification and resection. For patients with stage IB2 and bulky stage IIA disease there are four valid management options. These include primary chemoradiation, radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy +/- adjuvant chemoradiation, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radical surgery and chemoradiation followed by completion hysterectomy. The mainstay of treatment for patients with stage IIB - IVA disease is chemoradiation. Timely completion of treatment and the maintenance of haemoglobin between 12-14 g/dL are associated with optimal results. The role of surgery in advanced disease is controversial. There may be some role for the resection of bulky pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes prior to chemoradiation. With the advent of sophisticated imaging modalities of CT, MRI and PET scanning, the role of pre-treatment surgical staging via a retro-peritoneal or laparoscopic approach is more controversial. There is some role for primary exenerative surgery in selected patients with stage IVA disease involving either bladder or bowel mucosa. Treatment of patients with stage IVB and recurrent disease is highly individualised and may involve surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy."
i_1927,"2-MIB is not produced by cyanobacteria such as Pseudanabaena yagii, and its production remains unaffected by temperature changes and environmental conditions .","Outbreaks of 2‐methylisoborneol (2‐MIB) contamination in drinking water sources cause inconvenient odor issues in the water distribution system. In this study, microscopy‐based isolation with physiological and molecular phylogenetic characterization were performed to investigate and characterize the 2‐MIB odor producers that caused an odor problem in the freshwater system of the North Han River in the autumn of 2018. A benthic cyanobacterium was isolated from 2‐MIB odor-issue freshwater samples and was found to be phylogenetically affiliated with Pseudanabaena yagii (99.66% sequence similarity), which was recorded in South Korea for the first time. The 2‐MIB synthesis gene sequences from the odor‐issue freshwater samples showed 100% similarity with those in the P. yagii strains. Protein sequences of 2‐MIB synthase observed in the genome of the isolated strain showed structural and functional characteristics similar to those observed in other Pseudana-baena species. The 2‐MIB production rate increased slowly during mat formation on the vessel wall; however, it rapidly increased after the temperature dropped. The 2‐MIB gene was continuously expressed regardless of the temperature changes. These results suggest that the 2‐MIB odor issue in the North Han River might be caused by the release of 2‐MIB from the mat‐forming P. yagii species in a low‐temperature freshwater environment.
[4]: In many lakes and reservoirs, problems caused by off-flavours are known to be particularly associated with the occurrence of planktonic and benthic cyanobacteria. Frequently observed objectionable taste and odorous products of cyanobacteria are geosmin and 2-methylisoborneol.Investigations focused on the littoral zone of Wahnbach Reservoir (Germany) revealed that benthic cyanobacteria were present in this oligotrophic drinking water reservoir. Benthic cyanobacteria were found in the depth horizon between 1.75 m and 11 m, particularly on south-exposed slopes. This spatial distribution indicates a possible key role of the underwater light climate. Moreover, cell-bound and dissolved geosmin were detected in corresponding littoral samples. Both fractions were subjected to spatial and primarily temporal variations with maximum concentrations at the end of summer. However, a substantial lowering of the water level caused a diminution of cyanobacterial growth. Due to the drawdown of the water level concentrations of cell-bound geosmin and pigments (as a proxy of cyanobacterial biomass) were remarkably reduced, and dissolved geosmin was never detected during this phase. Except for the influence of water level fluctuation no other abiotic variables had a significant influence on pigment and geosmin concentrations. From geosmin concentrations detected in the littoral zone, the probability of serious episodes of odour events in the raw water of the Wahnbach Reservoir was estimated. Hence, the probability that the raw water was affected by geosmin was minor, which was supported by routine flavour profiles. Nevertheless, the study shows that odorous episodes caused by benthic cyanobacteria are likely to develop even in an oligotrophic lake or reservoir when these cyanobacteria, and consequently odorous production, proliferate. In principle, such a proliferation cannot be excluded as nutrients are available from the sediment pore water, and underwater light at the sediment surface in the sub-littoral is sufficiently high due to very low phytoplankton-induced turbidity under oligotrophic conditions. Thus, management-induced fluctuations of the water level seem to be the main control variable to generate light conditions at the sediment surface fluctuating in a given depth horizon faster than cyanobacteria can develop there. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
i_1975,"Challenges and Future Directions: Balancing Emission Reductions and Economic Activity: While clean energy and technology contribute to emission reductions, economic activity and industrialization can increase environmental degradation. Therefore, France must balance these factors to achieve sustainable emission reductions .","[6] Multilateral agreements at the global level have not succeeded in stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Following this assessment, a new way to look at climate issues seems necessary. Interest in adaptation is growing internationally, and transformational adaptation emerges today as a promising concept to address strategies of both mitigation and adaptation. In this article, we propose a new approach to consider local adaptation strategies based on capabilities. Relying on three case studies of local authorities in Île-de-France, we characterize their recent local adaptation strategies and analyse how these have taken capabilities into account. Different institutional tools allow for various ways of integrating capabilities. Plans Climat, which rely on technical studies, address administrations and professionals rather than citizens. Agendas 21 may provide a more holistic approach, but fail to address citizens' needs in order for them to act for adaptation. As for calls for associative or citizens projects, competition for funding does not foster cooperation. We demonstrate that the limitations put on public participation processes do not yet allow for the emergence and reinforcement of capabilities. Most of the local strategies studied in fact correspond to an adjustment approach to adaptation. However, spurred by recent objectives to strongly reduce emissions, new ways of integrating citizens' contributions into public policy have emerged.  [8] The UK needs to adopt a variety of measures in order to meet its stringent carbon budgets and GHG emission reduction targets (34% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020, and at least 80% by 2050). These emissions mitigations measures will include the use of renewables, Carbon Capture and Storage and the deployment of low carbon energy; however, the most cost effective strategy to reduce emissions while increasing energy security is to improve energy efficiency throughout the economy. Therefore, the UK adopted the CRC to manage and mitigate emissions through energy efficiency. The goal of the CRC is to reduce emissions throughout the UK economy by focusing on energy efficiency. And, in order to promote the adoption of energy reduction technologies, the UK government and program staff have also developed unique components of the program, for example the League Table, to help breakdown the traditional barriers that limit investment into energy efficiency. [16] The UK Government has unveiled a far-reaching scheme for deep emissions reductions stretching to 2050. The proposal is to introduce a series of so-called 'carbon budgets', reducing emissions by 60 per cent compared with 1990 levels. A Committee on Climate Change will be set up, ostensibly to provide advice and oversee the process. Transparent accounting for emissions based on international standards and annual reporting requirements will stimulate political debate on progress towards targeted reductions. In an attempt to give credibility to the commitment to reduce emissions, the bill proposes a legal duty to meet the targeted reductions. Despite suggestions to the contrary, the proposal stops short of measures that might lend real substance to the legal duty."
i_528,Advantages for Grasping: Enhanced Robustness: The ability to operate in various lighting conditions and the potential for multi-sensor integration make event-based cameras highly robust for grasping applications .,"Event cameras, i.e., the Dynamic and Active-pixel Vision Sensor (DAVIS) ones, capture the intensity changes in the scene and generates a stream of events in an asynchronous fashion. The output rate of such cameras can reach up to 10 million events per second in high dynamic environments. DAVIS cameras use novel vision sensors that mimic human eyes. Their attractive attributes, such as high output rate, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and high pixel bandwidth, make them an ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover, applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit from the high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional cameras. In this paper, a novel asynchronous corner tracking method is proposed that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring events, within a window size of 5 × 5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the 2D planar using a randomized Hough transform algorithm. Experimental evaluation showed that our approach is able to update the location of the extracted corners up to 100 times during the blind time of traditional cameras, i.e., between two consecutive intensity images.
[7]: Event-based cameras display great potential for a variety of tasks such as high-speed motion detection and navigation in low-light environments where conventional frame-based cameras suffer critically. This is attributed to their high temporal resolution, high dynamic range, and low-power consumption. However, conventional computer vision methods as well as deep Analog Neural Networks (ANNs) are not suited to work well with the asynchronous and discrete nature of event camera outputs. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) serve as ideal paradigms to handle event camera outputs, but deep SNNs suffer in terms of performance due to the spike vanishing phenomenon. To overcome these issues, we present Spike-FlowNet, a deep hybrid neural network architecture integrating SNNs and ANNs for efficiently estimating optical flow from sparse event camera outputs without sacrificing the performance. The network is end-to-end trained with self-supervised learning on Multi-Vehicle Stereo Event Camera (MVSEC) dataset. Spike-FlowNet outperforms its corresponding ANN-based method in terms of the optical flow prediction capability while providing significant computational efficiency.
[8]: The location precision by binocular camera sensitive to environment is not high, thus the grasping success rate and robustness are not sound in the existing grasping system. And in order to overcome this problem, this paper proposed a method of fusing vision of infrared sensors, tactile sensors and encoders, which can realize a reliable, robust system capable of adjusting grip force automatically. In order to avoid the situation of grasping-nothing, binocular camera coupled with monocular camera and infrared sensors were used to locate precisely. By integrating tactile sensors and encoders, and adding monitoring force and position information in the process of grasping, the phenomena of broken and slippage of the object were reduced to a great extent. The experiments demonstrate that the grasping success rate and the system performance are greatly improved by fusing multi-sensor data compared with signal sensor."

From the results of the panel FMOLS and the cross-sectional dependence regression, we do not find any support for the existence of the EKC for OECD countries. Moreover, the results present that the coefficient of financial development to CO<inf>2</inf> emissions is negative and statistically significant for eight countries (Austria, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and the U.S.).

s_1565,"Key Points: Extraction Methods: pH Shifting: This technique, used in other protein extractions, indicates that protein solubility and yield can be influenced by pH levels, with higher yields typically at extreme pH values (e.g. pH 2.0 and 11.0) .","The chemical composition and fractional distribution of protein isolates prepared from species of Mucuna bean were studied. Using six different extraction media, the yield of protein based on the Kjeldahl procedure varied from 8% to 34%, and the protein content varied from 75% to 95%. When the yields were high, the colour of the isolates generally tended to be dark and unsatisfactory. Hence, the use of chemical treatments and high pressure processing were explored. The solubility maxima for the protein isolates in water were found to occur at pH values of 2.0 and 11.0, while the pH corresponding to minimum solubility (i.e. isoelectric region) occurred at pH values of 4.0 and 5.0. The total essential amino acid in the isolates ranged from 495 to 557 mg g<sup>-1</sup> protein, which compares favourably with the recommended level for pre-school and school children. Methionine and cysteine were the limiting amino acids. A key nutritional attribute of the protein isolates was its high lysine content. The isolate can therefore complement cereal-based foods which are deficient in lysine. The proteins mainly consisted of albumins, glutelins and globulins. Prolamins were only present in trace concentration (<0.3%). Gel filtration chromatograms of the isolates indicated the presence of major protein fractions with molecular weights of 40 and 15 kDa, while gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) indicated a major broad zone with molecular weights of 36 ± 7 and 17.3 ± 3 kDa. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

[5]: The seaweed Saccharina latissima is often blanched to lower iodine levels, however, it is not known how blanching affects protein extraction. We assessed the effect of blanching or soaking (80/45/12 °C, 2 min) on protein yield and protein extract characteristics after pH-shift processing of S. latissima. Average protein yields and extract amino acid levels ranked treatments as follows: blanching-45 °C ∼ control > soaking ∼ blanching-80 °C. Although blanching-45 °C decreased protein solubilization yield at pH 12, it increased isoelectric protein precipitation yield at pH 2 (p < 0.05). The former could be explained by a higher ratio of large peptides/proteins in the blanched biomass as shown by HP-SEC, whereas the latter by blanching-induced lowering of ionic strength, as verified by a dialysis model. Moreover, blanching-45 °C yielded a protein extract with 49 % less iodine compared with the control extract. We recommend blanching-45 °C since it is effective at removing iodine and does not compromise total protein extraction yield."
s_528,Summary of Key Points: Vortex-Induced Vibrations: Controlling oscillatory forces can reduce undesirable effects on marine structures .,"Vortex induced vibrations can significantly affect the effectiveness of structures in aerospace as well as offshore marine industries. The oscillatory nature of the forces resulting from the vortex shedding around bluff bodies can result in undesirable effects such as increased loading, stresses, deflections, vibrations and noise in the structures, and also reduced fatigue life of the structures. To date, most studies concentrate on either the free oscillations or the prescribed motion of the bluff bodies. However, the structures in operation are usually subject to the external oscillatory forces (e.g. as a result of the platform motions in offshore industries). In this paper, we present the effects of the external cross-flow forces on the vortex-induced vibrations of an oscillating cylinder. The effects of the amplitude, as well as the frequency of the external forces on the fluid-forces on the oscillating cylinder are carefully studied and presented. Moreover, we present the transition of the response to be dominated by the vortex-induced-vibrations to the range where it is mostly dictated by the external oscillatory forces. All results are compared against free oscillations of the cylinder."
i_1617,"Influencing Factors: The type of carbon source, organic loading rates, and DO concentrations significantly impact COD removal efficiency. High SRT and the presence of biofilm media enhance the system's capacity to degrade organic matter .","The objective of this research was to determine the effects of dissolved oxygen on the biological nitrogen removal in the Integrated Fixed Film Activated Sludge (IFAS) and Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) systems. The carbonaceous and nitrogen removals were investigated at the COD/Nitrogen (C/N) ratios of 4, 6, and 10, and the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 mg/L. The experimental results indicate that the C/N ratios of 4, 6, and 10 and the DO concentrations of 2, 4, and 6 affected insignificantly on the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, but significantly on the nitrogen removal as the consequences of different nitrification and denitrifcation rates in both systems. The COD removal was nearly completed throughout this study because glucose was used as a primary carbon source in the wastewater and both systems were operated at high SRT relative to the minimum SRT requirement for COD removal. The experimental conditions used in this study apparently led to nitrite accumulation in both IFAS and MLE systems. It is suggested that there is no benefit of installing media in the IFAS system at the C/N ratio of 10 because the system was underloaded with the nitrogen. The lower DO concentration, the greater denitrification in the anoxic zone was achieved because nitrite nitrogen was used as an electron acceptor. At the C/N ratios of 4 and 6, the IFAS system was higher in capacity for nitrification as a result of attached biomass on the support media in the aerobic zone. The DO concentration of 6 mg/L is required to maximize the nitrification rates in the systems under these experimental conditions resulting in greater oxidized nitrogen for denitrification in the anoxic zones. The denitrification in the aerobic zone of the IFAS system is not evaluated due to unavailability of nitrite information. The optimal DO concentrations for biological nitrogen removal in the IFAS system at the C/N ratios of 4, 6, and 10 in this study were 6, 6, and 2 mg/L, respectively.

[8]: In this study, performance of Integrated Fixed-film Activated Sludge (IFAS) system in treatment of Linear Alkylbenzene Sulfonate (LAS), and oil & grease in synthetic greywater and effect of Organic Loading Rates (OLRs) on removal efficiency within a period of 105 days were investigated. Present study was carried out in a pilot scale under such conditions as temperature of 30 ± 1 °C, dissolved oxygen of 2.32 ± 0.91 mg/l, pH of 8.01 ± 0.95 and OLRs of 0.11–1.3gCOD/L.d. Also, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images were employed to specify rate of the biofilm formed on the media inside the reactor IFAS. The best removal efficiency for COD, LAS and oil and grease were respectively obtained as 92.52%, 94.24% and 90.07% in OLR 0.44gCOD/L.d. The assessment of loading rate indicated that with increased OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, removal efficiency of COD, oil and grease was increased while with increased OLR, removal efficiency was decreased. In doing so, based on the statistical test ANOVA, such a difference between removal efficiencies in diverse OLRs was significant for COD (p = 0.003), oil and grease (p = 0.01). However, in terms of LAS, with increased value of OLR to 0.44gCOD/L.d, the removal efficiency was increased and then with higher OLRs, removal efficiency was slightly decreased that is insignificant (p = 0.35) based on the statistical test ANOVA. The SEM images also showed that the biofilm formed on the media inside IFAS reactor plays a considerable role in adsorption and biodegradation of LAS, and oil & grease in greywater. The linear relation between inlet COD values and rate of removed LAS indicated that the ratio of inlet COD (mg/L) to removed LAS (mg/L) was 0.4. Therefore, use of IFAS system for biodegradation of LAS, oil and grease in greywater can be an applicable option."
i_1139,"Key Elements Contributing to Child Vulnerability: Parental and Family Health - Parental mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety, can affect child health. Maternal health during pregnancy, including nutrition and exposure to toxic substances, also plays a critical role .","[12] Background: Early child nutritional deficiencies are prevalent in low- and middle-countries with consequences linked not only to poor survival and growth, but also to poor development outcomes. Children in disadvantaged communities face multiple risks for nutritional deficiencies, yet some children may be less susceptible or may recover more quickly from malnutrition. A greater understanding is needed about factors which moderate the effects of nutrition-related risks and foster resilience to protect against or ameliorate poor development outcomes. Methods: A literature review was undertaken from August to December 2011 and updated in August 2012. Key word searches using terms Nutrition, Malnutrition, Child Development, Responsive Care, Stimulation, Low and Middle Income Countries and Resilience were undertaken using PubMed and Psychinfo. Results: Dietary adequacy is critical for growth and development, but current evidence indicates that nutrition supplementation alone is insufficient to foster resilience to protect against, mitigate, and recover from nutritional threats and to promote healthy development. The combination of nutrition interventions with stimulation and responsive care is necessary. Combined nutrition and psychosocial stimulation approaches can potentially work effectively together to promote protective factors and mitigate risks for poor cognitive, motor, social, and affective functioning helping children to adapt in times of adversity. However, there are gaps in our existing knowledge to combine nutrition and psychosocial stimulation interventions effectively and promote these interventions at scale. Conclusions: Research needs to address barriers at the level of family, community, programme, and policy which have prevented thus far the uptake of combined nutrition and psychosocial intervention strategies. Further investigations are needed on how to provide support to caregivers, enabling them to implement appropriate care for feeding and stimulation. Finally, the effect of combined interventions on pathways of care and protective mediators that foster resilience need to be better understood to determine focus areas for content of combined intervention curricula which help families in high-risk settings. © 2012 The Authors.

[16] Introduction: Children are the main value of any society, which plays a huge role in its development and prosperity. Meanwhile, they are the most vulnerable sector that have to be protected from negative physical and mental factors as well as diseases. A wide range of factors can affect the health of children, especially in their first year of life. Deep knowledge on those triggers may help to reduce the risk of developing different pathological conditions among them. Materials and Method: An integrated analysis and risk assessment of different pathologies in 767 outpatient children under 1 year were cunducted. A survey of the parents of those children was also conducted. The objectivity of the information obtained is guaranteed by the directed application of the method and techniques used in public health and healthcare, namely, medical-statistical analysis, sociological, psychological and expert analysis. Results: Many childrenhad a low risk of developing chronic diseases, including those with a hereditary predisposition and had a IIB health group, these are children with background of conditions and risk factors that can cause the formation of a chronic pathology. The third group of healthy children was represented by children with chronic pathology in the stage of compensation, the number of such babies was small (5.9±0.85%), as well as healthy babies with I (6.0±0.86%) and II A (4.2±0.72%) by health groups. Furthermore, more than half of the children of the first year of life had a normal functional state of the body. However, in 43% of cases, the functional state was impaired, which is manifested by the presence of various pathological conditions. Conclusion: Comprehensive integrated approach and using evidence-based medicine principles for studying the medical conditions in children under 1 year-old can be valuable and help us to obtain reliable data on the health conditions and affecting risk factors. [17] This chapter gives an overview of factors associated with emotional and behavioural disorders in children. In order to focus interventions effectively, be they public health, educational, psychological or social, it is helpful to know what factors place children at risk and what factors may protect children from such disorders. The chapter draws on two studies by the authors. Both these studies were based on longitudinal data from 17,000 children who took part in the National Child Development Study (NCDS). The first study identifies risk and protective factors for emotional and behavioural problems at 7, 11, and 16. The second study looks in more depth at the associations between parental background and psychological problems in adolescence and in adult life. It asked, what difference did it make to later psychological well-being whether a child was brought up in a birth, step, widowed or lone parent family? It also asked to what extent did an early experience of extreme social disadvantage and/or experience of public 'care' influence later mental health?."

Each treatment was assigned to 6 replicates of 7 birds. The samples for meat quality and serum biochemistry analysis were taken from 12 birds per treatment (2 birds/replicate). The results revealed better (P < 0.01) growth performance and production efficiency of birds fed either T<inf>5</inf> or T<inf>6</inf> diet compared to control or BMD supplemented diet and BMD-supplemented birds superseded the control birds. Higher (P < 0.01) serum and liver antioxidant enzyme activities, meat antioxidant capacity (2, 2-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid [ABTS] and 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl [DPPH] assays], serum total protein, high-density lipoproteins (HDL) cholesterol (P < 0.05), and globulin levels (P < 0.01) were observed in birds fed either T<inf>5</inf> or T<inf>6</inf> diet compared to control or BMD supplemented birds, whereas, lower lipid oxidation (P < 0.01), cardiac risk ratio, atherogenic coefficient, atherogenic index of plasma, serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol levels (P < 0.01), and serum albumin-to-globulin ratio (P < 0.05) were observed in the chickens. The pH of meat from birds fed T<inf>4</inf>, T<inf>5</inf> or T<inf>6</inf> diet was lower (P < 0.01) compared to control and other treatments. The extract release volume (ERV), water holding capacity (WHC), and protein content of meat were higher (P < 0.05) in birds fed either T<inf>5</inf> or T<inf>6</inf> diet compared to control or BMD supplemented birds. Thus, it was concluded that the supplementation of 0.2% MOS along with LBA at 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g is optimum for better growth performance, serum biochemistry, antioxidant profile, health indices, meat quality, and lipid oxidative stability of broiler chickens."

However, a basic understanding of procurement principles goes a long way in helping obtain required purchased supplies and services on time, within budget, and consistent with requirements. This chapter will provide a Project Manager (PjM) with a basic understanding of their role in the acquisition process by detailing the stages of procurement. While the term Project Manager is used throughout this chapter, many of their responsibilities may be delegated to a Technical Representative whom he/she has delegated authority for the technical oversight and direction of a procurement. This could be a PjM or other individual with adequate technical knowledge to provide appropriate technical oversight and provide technical direction to the contractor. The procurement life cycle consists of four primary phases, Pre-Award, Award, Post- Award, and Closeout (Figure 5.1)."
s_1964,"Resistance to Overfitting: The ensemble nature of RF helps in reducing the risk of overfitting, especially when dealing with noisy and complex ecological data .","Given that there are few studies on forest resource classification with the lack of relatively simple and effective methods, a forest resource classification method integrating object-oriented segmentation and random forest is proposed in this paper. Object-oriented segmentation technology could efficiently reduce the ""salt and pepper effect"", and random forest classification algorithm has the advantages of high accuracy, strong anti-noise ability and satisfying stability. Therefore, we built the optimum random forest classification model by adjusting the object-oriented segmentation parameters, constructing the optimal feature space and estimating the number of decision trees in random forests. Besides, the SVM algorithm is taken into comparison. The results show that the overall accuracy of the classification algorithm in this study is 83.34%with the Kappa coefficient reaching 0.789 2, which are significantly higher than that of SVM algorithm. It proves that object-oriented random forest classification can effectively improve the accuracy of forest resource classification.
[4]: Random Forests are an ensemble classification technique that employs a committee of diverse decision trees to make predictive decisions based on training set observations. In the conventional RF algorithm, individual tree decisions are aggregated with equal weighting to arrive at a majority vote. Recent initiatives have found merit in the use of leaf node purity and out of bag sets for estimating the probability of an individual tree's classification accuracy on unseen instances. This study proposes the concepts of Purity Gap Gain (PGG) and Relative Tree Confidence (RTC) as new ways of rating a decision tree's classification competence and ultimately influencing the quality of the resulting ensemble decision. PGG extends the idea of leaf node purity by taking into account the rate of purity convergence and the depth at which it takes place. RTC is a comprehensive score which takes into account the confidence with which a tree makes both correct and incorrect out of bag classifications. Statistical tests based on UCI datasets demonstrate the significant relationship between a RF's strength and the relative confidence of its decision trees. When applied to RFs with high strength, the proposed weighting methods demonstrate classification accuracy results that are predominantly comparable but at times superior to conventional approaches."
s_1030,"Key Components: Macronutrients: Proteins: Essential for growth and development. Preterm infants often require higher protein intake, and fortification helps meet these needs. Additionally, it is believed that the timing of protein fortification may influence long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants, although this remains to be conclusively proven .","Nutrition support of the premature infant must be designed to compensate for metabolic and gastrointestinal immaturity, immunologic compromise, and associated medical conditions. Nutritional needs are determined based on intrauterine rates of growth and nutrient accretion.1 The beneficial effects of human milk extend to the feeding of premature infants (Chapter 26). Human milk is capable of satisfying most of the needs of premature infants if careful attention is given to nutritional status. Nevertheless, because of their specialized needs the human milkfed premature infant may require nutrient supplementation, or fortification, to maintain optimal nutritional status while deriving benefits from enhanced host defense, neurologic development, and gastrointestinal function. The nutritional adequacy of human milk for premature infants may be limited for several reasons. The nutrient content of the milk may be inadequate for their needs and the variability in nutrient content results in an unpredictable nutrient intake for an infant who cannot feed ad libitum. Infants often receive restricted milk intakes. Mothers often are unable to supply sufficient milk to meet the needs of the infant throughout the hospitalization. As a consequence, nutrient inadequacy may manifest in the premature infant fed unfortified human milk. This review will focus on the feeding of fortified human milk to the premature infant. Composition of preterm milk Milk from mothers who give birth prematurely (preterm milk) generally has greater concentrations of immune proteins, lipid, energy, vitamins, calcium, sodium, and trace elements than in corresponding term milk.
[2]: Preterm infants fed fortified human milk (HM) in standard (STD) fashion grow slower than preterm formula fed infants. Recently, low protein intake has been proven to be the primary limiting factor responsible for this growth failure. The main reason of protein undernutrition despite fortification is that STD fortification is based on the customary assumptions about the composition of HM. However, the protein concentration of preterm HM is variable and decreases with the duration of lactation. Also, the protein concentration of banked donor milk, which is most often provided by mothers of term infants, is likely to be lower. Hence, most of the HM fed to preterm infants during the fortification period is likely to have an inadequately low protein concentration. This hypothesis has been confirmed very recently by comparing the assumed and actual protein intakes in preterm infants fed fortified HM. Novel fortification models have been devised to deal with the problem of ongoing protein undernutrition. Individualized fortification is the recommended method to optimize HM fortification. There are two models of individualization: ""adjustable fortification"" and ""targeted fortification"". Both ways are feasible and effective in improving protein intakes and growth. Adjustable fortification has the advantage of being practical and avoids excessive protein intakes. © 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.
[3]: During the last few decades, neonatal survival rates for preterm infants have markedly been improved. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that preterm neonates should receive sufficient nutrients to enable them to grow at a rate similar to that of fetuses of the same gestational age. Although human milk is the recommended nutritional source for newborn infants for at least the first six months of postnatal life, unfortified human breast milk may not meet the recommended nutritional needs of growing preterm infants. Human milk must therefore be supplemented (fortified) with the nutrients in short supply. The fortification of human milk can be implemented in two different forms: standard and individualized. The new concepts and recommendations for optimization of human milk fortification is the ""individualized fortification"". Actually, two methods have been proposed for individualization: the ""targeted/tailored fortification"" and the ""adjustable fortification"". In summary, the use of fortified human milk produces adequate growth in premature infants and satisfies the specific nutritional requirements of these infants. The use of individualized fortification is recommended. © 2011 Informa UK, Ltd."
s_1786,"Summary: Accelerated on-site aerobic decomposition of high-salt and oily food waste using a designed synthetic microbial community can be achieved by: Utilizing Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria: Including bacteria such as Pseudomonadaceae and Comamonadaceae, which are effective in degrading oily substances .","Stable and efficient hydrocarbon degrading microbial consortia were developed from a refinery sludge through nitrate amendment for their application in enhanced bioremediation of petroleum contaminated waste. Nitrate induced biostimulation of refinery sludge resulted in increased abundance of hydrocarbon degrading Rhodocyclaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Syntrophaceae and Comamonadaceae members. Repeated subculturing of nitrate stimulated communities in crude oil supplemented basal medium was done under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Aerobically enriched consortia (composed of Pseudomonadaceae, Pseudoxanthomonadaceae and unclassified Comamonadaceae) showed their ability to utilize alkanes, aromatics and crude oil as growth substrates. Anaerobically enriched consortium was predominated by Bacillaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Xanthomonadaceae, Porphyromonadaceae and Comamonadaceae members. Anaerobic consortium was found to be relatively less efficient in terms of TPH (total petroleum hydrocarbons) degradation compared to its aerobic counterpart. These enriched microbial consortia were finally tested for their biodegradation performance and stability during bioremediation of highly contaminated refinery sludge using different strategies. A 30 days microcosm based bioremediation trial showed that bioaugmentation of aerobic cultures with refinery sludge was more effective in TPH degradation (~ 65% degradation) compared to the anaerobic consortium (only 36% TPH degradation) and a combination of bioaugmentation and nitrate amendment with sludge resulted in enhanced hydrocarbon attenuation (up to 86% TPH degradation). Subsequent community analysis at the end of bioremediation trial confirmed the stability of the added microbial populations. Thus, the strategy of bioaugmentation of specially enriched native microbial populations in combination with nitrate amendment was successfully used for the enhanced bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated refinery waste."
i_2351,"Automated Systems: Employ automated systems for microbial detection and identification, such as MALDI-TOF MS, which generally provides reliable results, although some studies indicate a significant number of misidentifications may occur .","Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is increasingly used for the identification of bacteria and fungi in the diagnostic laboratory. We evaluated the mold database of Bruker Daltonik (Bremen, Germany), the Filamentous Fungi Library 1.0. First, we studied 83 phenotypically and molecularly well-characterized, nondermatophyte, nondematiaceous molds from a clinical strain collection. Using the manufacturer-recommended interpretation criteria, genus and species identification rates were 78.3% and 54.2%, respectively. Reducing the species cutoff from 2.0 to 1.7 significantly increased species identification to 71.1% without increasing misidentifications. In a subsequent prospective study, 200 consecutive clinical mold isolates were identified by the MALDI Biotyper and our conventional identification algorithm. Discrepancies were resolved by ribosomal DNA (rDNA) internal transcribed spacer region sequence analysis. For the MALDI Biotyper, genus and species identification rates were 83.5% and 79.0%, respectively, when using a species cutoff of 1.7. Not identified were 16.5% of the isolates. Concordant genus and species assignments of MALDI-TOF MS and the conventional identification algorithm were observed for 98.2% and 64.2% of the isolates, respectively. Four erroneous species assignments were observed using the MALDI Biotyper. The MALDI Biotyper seems highly reliable for the identification of molds when using the Filamentous Fungi Library 1.0 and a species cutoff of 1.7. However, expansion of the database is required to reduce the number of nonidentified isolates. Copyright © 2014 American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved."

This is evident in locomotor function assessments at both 1 and 4 years post-stroke, where women consistently performed worse than men .","Objective: Recent studies have demonstrated gender differences in functional outcome after stroke. However, the underlying reasons for differences have been inconsistent. The present study examined whether gender differences in long-term functional outcomes exist among surviving patients with first-ever ischemic stroke and with individual subtypes of stroke. Methods: A total of 997 patients (654 men, 343 women) were followed for 5 years after discharge. Patients were assigned to 4 subtypes of ischemic stroke (atherothrombotic, lacunar, cardioembolic and unclassified infarction). Functional outcomes were expressed as locomotor activity, assessed using a questionnaire delivered by mail 1 and 5 years after stroke. Locomotor function was classified into 5 categories according to the grade of disability. Results: Women showed significantly worse locomotor function than men at both 1 and 5 years (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). Furthermore, significant gender differences in functional outcome were observed in all subtypes of ischemic stroke at 1 and 5 years after stroke. Logistic regression analysis revealed that gender was a significant determinant for functional outcome at 1 and 5 years after stroke (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). No significant gender difference was seen in the rate of stroke recurrence. Women also showed a worse survival ratio after stroke than men (p < 0.01). Conclusion: The present study demonstrated significantly worse functional outcomes for women than for men at 1 and 5 years after stroke.

The organic rice market's development trend has increased significantly from year to year but faces competition from other ASEAN countries. This study aims to formulate an export strategy for Indonesian organic rice, particularly West Java. The research locations are Tasikmalaya and Bandung Regencies. The survey was conducted in March-October 2018. Data and information were collected at the provincial and regency levels through in-depth interviews with respondents related to organic rice development, including farmers, administrators of farmer groups/farmer groups association, and traders. SWOT analysis was employed in processing the data and information. The analysis results show that organic rice exports are in the Strength-Threat (S-T) quadrant, which indicates that the organic rice export strategy has a decisive strength factor but faces significant challenges. The main strategy needed to encourage organic rice exports is to take advantage of the strength of support from the Regional Government in developing organic rice to overcome the threat of expanding organic rice from other producing countries with higher competitiveness."

More and more healthcare professionals and patients are adopting connected health solutions. It is expected that the advances in the Information and Communication Technologies in healthcare services will keep increasing in the future. Given the deterioration of the environment a growing need to consider sustainability in technology is observed. Moreover, there is an increasing interest in software sustainability among the software engineering community. Software sustainability is about producing environment-friendly products to support sustainability goals. It aims also to achieve sustainable products that have limited impact on the environment. In this vein, an assessment method using a checklist for the software sustainability of connected health application is proposed in this paper. To this end, the individual, social, environmental and technical dimensions of software sustainability were considered. The checklist was generated from a reusable requirement catalog intended for sustainable connected health applications. In addition, the checklist artifact can serve as a tool to audit this kind of e-health applications in sustainability.
[6]: Context: Software sustainability is an emergent topic in an age when software is becoming ever more ubiquitous. We, as researchers, have the responsibility of ensuring the dissemination of sustainable software developments in the industry and academic contexts before enacting the creation of a body of knowledge in software sustainability. Our paper presents a review of project descriptions from a project-based course designed in close collaboration with students and external customers. Our master's course is based on four decades of software engineering experience and teaching at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology. In the scope of this work, we analyzed 45 customers' project proposals over the past three years to identify the social and technical sustainability addressed by the proposals. Objectives: More precisely, we investigated 1) how software social sustainability topics are introduced from customers' project descriptions, 2) how software technical sustainability is addressed from customers' project descriptions, and 3) the extent to which software environmental and economical sustainability is addressed from customers' project descriptions. Method: We conducted a deductive thematic analysis utilizing open coding of customers' project descriptions. Results: We found that customers' project descriptions moderately addressed social sustainability for specific target groups. Technical sustainability is also addressed by a little more than half of the overall projects. However, we observed that no effort was made to address environmental and economic sustainability.

In Europe, the wind power has often been used in the last decades and, more recently, a trend for offshore utilization has been noticed. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the specific planning and engineering considerations relevant to construction of wind farms in shallow waters. The aim of this study is investigate the potential for wind power plants in shallow waters at sites with contrasting bio-geo-climatic characteristics. Scotland is well known for the potential offshore wind energy and in Brazil, where this technique is not yet in use, there are only initial studies with indication of governmental interest for future implantations in great lakes. The focus of this study is on the environmental impact assessment as well as the impact on coastal communities and public participation in the decision-making. To this end, this study reviews the current practice in site determination, planning, and construction while investigating the potential for construction of wind farms at two shallow waters locations in Scotland and Brazil. A comparative study between the two countries for offshore wind turbines geotechnics with proper structure at low depths of water, taking into accounts the environmental characteristics and needs along with suitable wind towers construction is outlined. The results show variation of construction models used by both countries regarding the environmental impact assessment and a convergent tendency for projects planning acceptance by the communities.

i_2062,"On-Farm Diversification: Entrepreneurial farm businesses that engage in diversification have reported increased net income, reduced dependence on subsidies, and greater income stability. Networking processes and generic business support have been crucial for managing change and achieving these outcomes. Additionally, it is believed that the long-term sustainability of these businesses may lead to increased community engagement and social responsibility initiatives, although this has not been directly assessed in the current literature .","Despite the growing importance attached to entrepreneurship as a policy concept in European Union (EU) agriculture, little assessment has been made of its practical application. This paper makes a preliminary consideration of the issues in relation to on-farm diversification. First the literatures on agricultural diversification and innovation are reviewed to establish entrepreneurial traits in (1) business change processes, and (2) business enterprise characteristics. The business enterprise characteristics are then used to identify entrepreneurial diversified businesses from a sample of 118 agricultural enterprises in England. Some 15 entrepreneurial farm businesses were identified and their managers interviewed to reflect on the underlying change processes that they had adopted during 1997-2001; the effects of diversification in terms of socio-economic benefits at business and regional levels; and the effectiveness of agricultural business advice services in supporting entrepreneurial behaviour. Respondents confirmed the importance of networking processes to managing change in their businesses. Importantly all had benefited from diversification, through increased net income, reduced dependence on agricultural subsidies and greater income stability during the survey period. Regional economic benefits were more difficult to quantify, although positive employment generating effects were evident among businesses. Importantly respondents commented on their disengagement from sectoral extension agencies in contrast to their enthusiastic use of generic business support. Consequently, consideration is made of adjustments in extension and advisory provision to enhance on-farm entrepreneurial diversification."
i_582,"Challenges and Solutions: Renewable Energy Integration: Utilizing renewable energy sources (RES) like solar and wind can actually increase the strain on the grid and hinder sustainability efforts, particularly in regions with inconsistent energy production .","The market for electric vehicles has been growing enormously over the last two years and should continue to expand exponentially. This requires a large domestic and commercial charging network. The EV charging infrastructure that enables electric vehicle adoption relies heavily on partnerships between the private and public sectors, including utilities, government agencies, automakers, and the general public. Electric vehicles are shifting energy paradigms for mobility around the world. Many factors contribute to a consideration of fueling with electricity: When to charge, where to charge, how fast can the vehicle charge, and who will charging affect? As more electric vehicles pull power from the grid, utilities will need to address the increasing demand drivers will place on the grid. Energy storage and source from solar PV systems provides an eloquent solution to power providers and drivers alike.
[6]: The usage of electric vehicles (EV) has been increasing over the last few years due to a rise in fossil fuel prices and the rate of increasing carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) emissions. EV-charging stations are powered by existing utility power grid systems, increasing the stress on the utility grid and the load demand at the distribution side. DC grid-based EV charging is more efficient than AC distribution because of its higher reliability, power conversion efficiency, simple interfacing with renewable energy sources (RESs), and integration of energy storage units (ESU). RES-generated power storage in local ESU is an alternative solution for managing the utility grid demand. In addition, to maintain the EV charging demand at the microgrid levels, energy management and control strategies must carefully power the EV battery charging unit. In addition, charging stations require dedicated converter topologies, control strategies, and need to follow set levels and standards. Based on EV, ESU, and RES accessibility, different types of microgrid architecture and control strategies are used to ensure optimum operation at the EV-charging point. Based on the above said merits, this review paper presents different RES-connected architecture and control strategies used in EV-charging stations. It highlights the importance of different charging station architectures with current power converter topologies proposed in the literature. In addition, a comparison of microgrid-based charging station architecture with its energy management, control strategies, and charging converter controls are also presented. The different levels and types of charging stations used for EV charging, in addition to controls and connectors used, are also discussed. An experiment-based energy management strategy was developed to control power flow among the available sources and charging terminals for the effective utilization of generated renewable power. The main motive of the EMS and its control is to maximize the usage of RES consumption. This review also provides the challenges and opportunities in EV-charging, and parameters in selecting appropriate charging stations.
[8]: In this work we present the current state of development and future direction in the market for electric vehicles, with respect to the charging infrastructure. Specifically we discuss the electric vehicle network which is a proposed infrastructure system of publicly accessible charging stations, and battery swap stations to recharge electric vehicles. As Tunisia is a country with more than 250 sunny-days, it is reasonable to extend currently used filling stations by solar generators and battery-swapping equipment to build a balanced charging system for electric vehicles, support by renewable energy from distributed sources. © 2012 IEEE.
[9]: The rising proportion of renewable energy (RE) penetration with high variability introduces immense pressure on the stability of power grids. At the same time, a rapid increase in electric vehicle (EV) penetration level leads to uncoordinated charging loads, which poses significant challenges to operators. By properly guiding and scheduling the charging behaviors, EV may no longer be a burden, but a valuable asset to mitigate the RE integration problem. In this brief, we first propose a prioritization ranking algorithm of EV drivers based on their driving and charging behaviors, and then we propose a blockchain-based EV incentive system to maximize the utilization of RE. The proposed system is secure, anonymous, and decentralized. By incorporating the utilities, EV drivers, EV charging service providers, and RE providers into the proposed incentive system, this brief provides a plan to guide the EV users to charge at the desired time frames with higher RE generation. The market mechanism of the incentive system is discussed. The effectiveness of the system is verified by simulation."

i_2191,"Conservation and Application: Efforts should be made to conserve beneficial symbionts and apply this knowledge in agriculture, medicine, and conservation biology .","The skin of animals is enveloped by a symbiotic microscopic ecosystem known as the microbiome. The host and microbiome exhibit a mutualistic relationship, collectively forming a single evolutionary unit sometimes referred to as a holobiont. Although the holobiome theory highlights the importance of the microbiome, little is known about how the skin microbiome contributes to protecting the host. Existing studies focus on humans or captive animals, but research in wild animals is in its infancy. Specifically, the protective role of the skin microbiome in hibernating animals remains almost entirely overlooked. This is surprising, considering the massive population declines in hibernating North American bats caused by the fungal pathogen Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome. Hibernation offers a unique setting in which to study the function of the microbiome because, during torpor, the host's immune system becomes suppressed, making it susceptible to infection. We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on the protective role of the skin microbiome in non-human animals. We selected 230 publications that mentioned pathogen inhibition by microbes residing on the skin of the host animal. We found that the majority of studies were conducted in North America and focused on the bacterial microbiome of amphibians infected by the chytrid fungus. Despite mentioning pathogen inhibition by the skin microbiome, only 30.4% of studies experimentally tested the actual antimicrobial activity of symbionts. Additionally, only 7.8% of all publications studied defensive cutaneous symbionts during hibernation. With this review, we want to highlight the knowledge gap surrounding skin microbiome research in hibernating animals. For instance, research looking to mitigate the effects of white-nose syndrome in bats should focus on the antifungal microbiome of Palearctic bats, as they survive exposure to the Pseudogymnoascus destructans -pathogen during hibernation. We also recommend future studies prioritize lesser-known microbial symbionts, such as fungi, and investigate the effects of a combination of anti-pathogen microbes, as both areas of research show promise as probiotic treatments. By incorporating the protective skin microbiome into disease mitigation strategies, conservation efforts can be made more effective.
[10]: A symbiotic relationship involves two or more organisms living together for mutual benefit(s). Neither partner could do well without the other. Symbionts are the individual partners in the relationship. Microsymbiosis is a relationship in which one of partners is a micro-organism. Most of the symbioses involve higher plants acting as hosts to micro-organisms. Microsymbionts play a major role in plant nutrition especially for nitrogen, phosphorus and water availability in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. They are a valuable resource for national development especially to countries, like Uganda, whose economies are heavily agro-based. This review gives an inventory of the present knowledge on microsymbionts in Uganda and identifies future priorities for research, application and capacity building. In Uganda, not much is known or has been done regarding microsymbionts and their importance in both natural and agroecosystems. This may be associated with the fact that there are few scholars in the field of soil science available in the country. There is no specific policy on the conservation of microsymbionts. Attempts have been made on production and use of Rhizobium inoculants for promotion of the role of legumes in agricultural production. Other symbioses like mycorrhizae, Azolla and Frankia have not been exploited. Awareness raising and in-depth research on soil microsymbionts' production and use are recommended. © 2007 The Authors."

In this perspective, the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) becomes a preferred methodology for developing software applications. This chapter proposes to integrate the three paradigms, namely Cloud computing, SOA, and MDA, to yield Cloud software services that are robust, flexible, and agile. Convergence of SOA and MDA paradigms in the development of Cloud software services will provide an apt solution to technology obsolescence.

Some of these developments in digital revolution are cloud computing, mobilization and miniaturization of computing, and the evolution of wireless technologies. The convergence of these technological advancements will be integrated to information and telecommunication systems.
[3]: Introduction: Neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) have complex patients in terms of their diagnoses and required treatments. Antimicrobial treatment is a common therapy for patients in NICUs. To solve problems pertaining to empirical therapy, antimicrobial stewardship programs have recently been introduced. Despite the success of these programs in terms of data collection, there is still inefficiency in terms of analyzing and reporting the data. Thus, to successfully implement these stewardship programs, the design of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) surveillance systems is recommended as a first step. As a result, this study aimed to design an AMR surveillance system for use in the NICUs in northwestern Iranian hospitals to cover these information gaps. Methods: The recommended system is compatible with the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. The business intelligence (BI) requirements were extracted in an interview with a product owner (PO) using a valid and reliable checklist. Following this, an AMR surveillance system was designed and evaluated in relation to user experiences via a user experience questionnaire (UEQ). Finally, an association analysis was performed on the database, and the results were reported by identifying the important multidrug resistances in the database. Results: A customized software development methodology was proposed. The three major modules of the AMR surveillance are the data registry, dashboard, and decision support modules. The data registry module was implemented based on a three-tier architecture, and the Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) and dashboard modules were designed based on the BI requirements of the Scrum product owner (PO). The mean values of UEQ measures were in a good range. This measures showed the suitable usability of the AMR surveillance system. Conclusion: Applying efficient software development methodologies allows for the systems' compatibility with users' opinions and requirements. In addition, the construction of interdisciplinary communication models for research and software engineering allows for research and development concepts to be used in operational environments.

It is specially emphasized about the changes that have occurred in recent years in such kind of systems and in what are the trends for the coming future. Between this trends it is possible identify several technical advances and new functionalities that are being joined or that will be soon. For example, a new functionality or advance that is incorporating is the mcommerce, which not only can influence the information system in a high degree but also in the strategies and management activities of currently companies.
[6]: Controlling a software project has a major effect on the project's productivity, expenses and the quality of a project's product and code. This work investigates Application Lifecycle Management which considers how software, the software process and its different phases are controlled. With the help of Application Lifecycle Management a working database interface for embedded testing framework has been developed. In this Microsoft Team Foundation Server is used for managing the software project. As a software process SCRUM is used by utilizing SCRUM for Team System process template developed by Conchango. The process template is customized to bring support for requirement management in to it. The customized process template is used in the demo project, in which a database interface for embedded testing framework is developed. Thus the process template customization is tested in practice and experiences of ALM, Microsoft TFS and SCRUM process are gathered. During development of the embedded testing framework, which is one sort of generic data gathering tool, one must pay attention to many issues such as data transport methods and formats, database solutions, data export methods and integration. Database interface software, called Probe DB, is developed according to the requirements of the customer. Own CSV and binary data transport formats and XML format for export functionality are designed, and interfaces for file and TCP/IP import and for Eclipse IDE are developed. Software is coded with Python and MySQL will serve as database solution. Copyright © VTT 2009.
[7]: There has been much discussion of the role that recent advances in information and communication technologies (ICTs) could play in improving health systems in developing countries. There is no doubt that the advancement of ICTs has brought both brought opportunities and challenges to developing countries in their efforts to ensure socio-economic development and improve public governance. In the wake of globalization, developing countries have no choice but to take advantage of the opportunities and face the challenges. Despite the fact that many developing countries are taking actions to strengthen their ICT capabilities in both private and public sector organizations, the process has been limited mostly to national and provincial capitals leaving behind majority of the communities and institutions operating in remote areas. This paper took a case study of implementing computerized Health Information Systems (HIS) in the context of the Ethiopian public health care system and investigated the potentials of the new ICT based system and the challenges encountered at provincial and district levels. The findings also revealed that even those with access to modern ICT infrastructure do not get maximum benefit from ICT advancements due to inadequacies in data quality and lack of knowledge in data management and use for decision making and action. To this end, there is an urgent need for governments of most developing countries in general and for sub-Saharan African countries in particular to double their efforts to address constraints threatening to increase technology gap between urban minority and marginalized rural majority by setting up favorable policies and appropriate strategies. For example, the empirical analysis of this study revealed that in order to make IT-based systems work in the Ethiopian public health seating, there is an urgent need to develop proper strategies that took into account the local context. © (2013) by the AIS/ICIS Administrative Office All rights reserved."
i_922,Quality and Safety: Prefabrication ensures higher quality control and increased safety during construction .,"Prefabricated buildings have been shown to provide a new way of sustainable construction to reduce the amount of work on construction sites, reduce pollution, shorten construction time, and increase safety. However, many issues in the actual production process (e.g., quality check, storage, and installation of the prefabricated components) are mainly caused by the lack of the information being collected and shared. In order to better monitor and manage the prefabrication process efficiently, this research proposes a framework that integrates radio frequency identification (RFID) and building information modeling (BIM) technologies. The scope of this paper is the discussion of the framework and its application for prefabricated housing production. A preliminary study focused on the manufacturing process of integrating RFID tags with the prefabrication of the components. About 200 reinforced concrete components were embedded with a passive RFID tag. Results of the experiments showed a 90% reduction of signal strength when passive RFID tags are embedded in concrete, with less than a 1.5% fail rate. Current RFID tag implanting techniques still need to be improved to meet the actual demands of the construction industry and increase the signal strength. Significantly, this research shows promising results that the framework could establish a high efficient, low cost, and easily implementable information capturing and sharing system for further planning and management of prefabrication.
[9]: To address the under-supply and poor build quality of housing in the UK, the use of offsite technologies has been promoted. Precast concrete crosswall is an offsite technology encouraged for use for multi-storey developments. However, the uptake of crosswall is slow, which constitutes a risk to long-term housing delivery. This paper addresses this risk by revealing an insight into the utilisation of crosswall for multistorey residential buildings in the organisational context. The paper reports on longitudinal case study research of 20 crosswall buildings, consisting of 1930 apartments in total, constructed by a leading UK housebuilder in recent five years. The case study involved document analysis and personal interviews with the company and their supply chains. The rationale for utilising crosswall included considerations of design, technical, commercial, procurement and construction. The primary driver was simplicity from both procurement and contractual aspects, which enabled the developer to construct buildings up to 20 storeys without engaging specialist main contractors. Other benefits included reduced on-site duration, enhanced quality of finish, reduced waste, improved health and safety and cost savings, whilst issues existed in design, procurement and construction. To fully realise the potential benefits from utilising crosswall requires modifications to existing design process and supply chain management and cultural support to innovation and learning. Strategies are developed from the longitudinal learning process. They should encourage the uptake of crosswall and improve quality and efficiency of housing supply in the future."
s_1790,The systematic analysis and techno-economic evaluation of these processes can help identify the most promising pathways for integrating SCG into the circular economy .,"[2] The enabling role of Digital Technologies towards the Circular Economy transition has been recognized. Nonetheless, to support the transition, the operationalization of the discourse is still needed. The present study performs a systematic literature review, deepening the knowledge on the role of Digital Technologies in operationalizing the Circular Economy transition. The analysis is shaped according to the ReSOLVE framework, as it has been recognized as able to operationally guide industrial firms towards the Circular Economy transition. Despite the broad focus on the topic by the extant literature, the results of the analysis show limited Circular Economy aspects addressed and specific technologies considered, making it difficult to have a complete overview on the implementation of Digital Technologies in the Circular Economy transition, operatively addressing it. Shortcomings are identified regarding the lack of an integrated and holistic analysis of the relation-ships, the need for investigating the decision‐making process and specific Circular Economy prac-tices, all from an empirical perspective. The paper eventually suggests streams for further research while offering theoretical and practical implications. [7] Rising populations put huge stresses on natural resources. Extraction and depletion of raw materials and waste created throughout the supply chain of products have enormous environmental and socioeconomic impacts. One way to reduce these impacts is through the move towards the circular economy (CE). CE aims to solve resource, waste, and emission challenges confronting society by creating a production-to-consumption total supply chain that is restorative, regenerative, and environmentally benign. This article highlights research challenges and identifies process systems engineering (PSE) research opportunities to assist in the understanding, analysis and optimization of CE supply chains. A motivating example on the supply chain of coffee is introduced to illustrate the challenges of the transition towards a CE and to propose PSE research opportunities."
i_2261,"Insect-Based Protein: Applications: Insect proteins are being explored as alternatives in various animal feeds, such as for poultry and fish, and while they show some results in growth performance, they often lead to reduced nutrient utilization compared to traditional sources .","Insects are promising candidates as alternative sustainable sources of protein for poultry species. The present research studied the effect of a dietary inclusion of a defatted black soldier fly (BSF) larvae meal as an alternative protein source in the diets of laying quails, on productive performance, egg physicochemical quality, fatty acid profile, sensory traits and storage stability. A total of 225 laying quails were divided into 3 dietary groups (5 replicates/each). A conventional soybean meal-based diet was formulated (Control group), and two other diets were formulated including either 10% (BSF10) or 15% (BSF15) defatted BSF larvae meal. Laying quails showed satisfactory productive performance throughout the trial. BSF10 and BSF15 eggs had the highest shape index (p < 0.01), shell weight and percentage (p < 0.001) and the most intense yolk color (p < 0.001). Defatted BSF larvae meal increased the eggs' saturated fatty acid content (p < 0.001) to the detriment of the polyunsaturated fraction (p < 0.001). Overall the eggs' sensory profile was not affected by the dietary treatment, but BSF15 eggs had a higher feed off-flavor vs Control group (p < 0.05). At day 28 of storage, oxidative stability was higher in BSF10 vs. Control eggs (p < 0.01). Defatted BSF larvae meal can be considered a possible alternative ingredient to soybean meal in laying quail diets, up to the 15% inclusion level.
[6]: Fishmeal (FM) and soy meal (SM) are the most common protein sources used in fish feed, but they are associated with environmental, economic or production problems. Insects could be an interesting alternative source of protein. This work investigates the nutritive value of Tenebrio molitor meal (TM) and the effect of total replacement of SM by TM (TM/FM diet) or partial replacement of FM by TM (TM/FM/SM diet) versus a diet based in SM and FM (FM/SM diet) for tilapia. We studied the chitin content in TM, the in vitro protein digestibility, protease activity, oxidative stress and antioxidant defences, growth performance and nutrient utilization. The results indicate that an inclusion up to 500 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of TM in the diet did not affect feed intake, in vitro protein digestibility, muscle amino acid composition or biometric indexes. However, their inclusion reduced growth performance and affected the muscle fatty acid profile. The lowest values for protease activity, elevated FRAP in digestive tracts and ROS level in muscle and higher SOD activity were observed in fish fed with SM/FM diet. The use of TM requires better understanding of the role of chitin in digestion and the study of toxins that might affect fish growth."

Concentration: Ineffective at 0.2% and 0.4%.","A 45-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) and β-glucan supplementation in Pacific whiteleg shrimp, Penaeus vannamei juvenile. Shrimps (0.6 g ABW) were fed diets supplemented with different levels of mannan oligosaccharide (MOS) and β-glucan (BZT® PRE-GE) as immunostimulants. Experimental diets were formulated to contain 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8% and a control. The feeding trial was conducted in 50-L capacity rectangular plastic container stocked with 20 shrimps each in triplicates. Growth, survival, resistance to Vibrio parahaemolyticus, total haemocyte count (THC), respiratory burst activity, phenoloxidase activity, and clearance efficiency were evaluated. Results showed that growth and survival were not affected by supplementation of immunostimulant. On the other hand, bacterial challenge showed 100% mortality in 0.8% MOS + β-glucan fed group though not significant with the control. Total haemocyte count, respiratory burst and phenoloxidase activity were significantly enhanced in the group supplemented with 0.4% and 0.2% of MOS + β-glucan. Immune responses of the group fed with the highest concentration (0.8%) were significantly suppressed. The same trend was obtained for the clearance efficiency. The present results demonstrated that using MOS + β-glucan less than or equal to 0.4% activate immune responses and resistance against vibriosis, otherwise overstimulation of the immune indices could cause immunosuppression."
i_1355,"Considerations and Risks: Chronic transfusions can lead to iron overload, which may not always require iron chelation therapy, as some patients might not experience significant complications from iron levels .","Blood transfusion plays a prominent role in the management of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD), but causes significant iron overload. As transfusions are used to treat the severe complications of SCD, it remains difficult to distinguish whether organ damage is a consequence of iron overload or is due to the complications treated by transfusion. Better management has resulted in increased survival, but prolonged exposure to iron puts SCD patients at greater risk for iron-related complications that should be treated. The success of chelation therapy is dominated by patient adherence to prescribed treatment; thus, adjustment of drug regimens to increase adherence to treatment is critical. This review will discuss the current biology of iron homeostasis in patients with SCD and how this informs our clinical approach to treatment. We will present the clinical approach to treatment of iron overload at our centre using serial assessment of organ iron by magnetic resonance imaging.
[10]: Red blood cell transfusions have become standard of care for the prevention of life-threatening anemia in patients with β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease (SCD). However, frequent transfusions can lead to accumulation of iron that can result in liver cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, arthritis, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, heart failure, and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Iron chelation therapy has been shown to reduce serum ferritin levels and liver iron content, but limitations of trial design have prevented any demonstration of improved survival. The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the impact of iron chelation therapy on overall and event-free survival in patients with β-thalassemia and SCD. Eighteen articles discussing survival in β-thalassemia and 3 in SCD were identified. Overall iron chelation therapy resulted in better overall survival, especially if it is instituted early and compliance is maintained. Comparative studies did not show any significant differences between available iron chelation agents, although there is evidence that deferiprone is better tolerated than deferoxamine and that compliance is more readily maintained with the newer oral drugs, deferiprone and deferasirox. Iron chelation therapy, particularly the second-generation oral agents, appears to be associated with improved overall and event-free survival in transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia and patients with SCD."
i_1303,"Low Latency: The low latency of 5G networks ensures real-time communication, which is critical for applications like remote surgery and real-time monitoring of patients .","Research and development for the 5th-generation (5G) wireless systems has been initiated several years ago [1-3]. Such systems, which are set for commercial use sometime around 2020, are expected to provide new types of enhanced user connectivity services, in terms of providing very high data rates, increased capacity, improved security, higher reliability, reduced latency, increased quality of service and availability, and energy efficiency (EE). According to the 5G standard such systems should provide higher data rates, for example, tens of Mb/s and accommodating tens of thousands of users providing data rates of 100 Mb/s for metropolitan areas. Furthermore, their spectral efficiency (SE) will increase significantly, as compared to the SE achieved by the 4th-generation (4G) wireless systems, their coverage will also improve and their latency will be reduced significantly as compared to Long-Term Evolution (LTE) [2].
[2]: 5G (fifth generation) technology is used to interconnect all terminals, networks, multiple wireless technologies, applications simultaneously which can also switch between them based on VOIP (Voice-over-IP), flat IP, and Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6), thus user experiences call volume services and high-level data transmission. 5G network is reliable and very fast with minimum delay, higher data rate, greater security, real-time data handling, less error rate, and few data losses. The core technologies used in 5G networks include cloud computing, Heterogeneous Network (Het Net), internet of things (IoT), Cognitive Radio (CR) network, software-defined networking (SDN), Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO), and massive MIMO. 5G produces different harmful effects such as human health issues, environmental issues, health issues on birds and animals, thermal effects, etc. Regulating agencies have to set a Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), its maximum levels for handsets, and every mobile phone must have a SAR rating. 5G technology is used as intelligent technology in which 5G mobile phones can also be used as a tablet PC. This paper presents a general review on 5G along with its comparison with 4G, the general architecture of 5G, a detailed explanation about core technologies of 5G, and also harmful effects on different issues using 5G.
[3]: The considerable characteristics of 5G technology (Fifth Generation of telecommunication) is the very high amount of data that can be transmitted in the time unit (data speed: Megabits per second - throughput) and the very low delay in data exchange (latency). ElectroMagnetic Fields (EMFs) are used for decades for communication reasons and broadcasting. 700 MHz and lower frequencies are currently being used in Digital TV. Low frequencies (800, 900 MHz) are also being used in previous (but still existing) technologies 2G, 3G, 4G, 4G+. 5G will exploit both low and high frequencies. 5G will be operation mainly in a low band (700 MHz) and a high band (3.5 GHz). In the near future mmWave bands will also be used above 6 GHz (for example 24 GHz, 28 GHz and above). Theoretical models and live measurements have consistently shown that the actual maximum power is always less than the 25% of the maximum peak power of a Massive-MIMO antenna. ICNIRP has published in 1998 ""Guidelines for Limiting Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (100 kHz to 300 GHz)"". The current revision (2020) is based on the same criteria, but it exhibits more accuracy in dosimetry calculations, considering details and based on better biological rationale. mmWave bands (> 6 GHz) is a controversial issue for the population. Reports did not show adverse health effects in daily life under the safety limits. WHO is currently preparing a review about health risks assessment of RF exposure (including mm-Waves), which will be completed by 2022. There is no evidence of adverse health effects at exposure levels below the basic restrictions as described in the ICNIRP (1998) and ICNIRP (2020) guidelines and no evidence of an interaction mechanism that would predict that adverse health effects could occur due to radiofrequency EMF exposure below restriction levels. The new Guidelines provide protection against all adverse health effects, regardless of whether they are due to acute or chronic exposures, regardless of age or health status. Radio and Microwave Frequencies, where mobile technology and Wi-Fi operate, are used in Medicine for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. These bands are used for various application as Microwave Diathermy (same band as 2G, 3G and Wi-Fi technologies), Microwave induced thermoacoustic echography (same band as 4G technology), Medical Imaging / localization of tumors (same bands as 2G, 3G, 4G and 5G technologies) and Medical Monitoring / Measurement of vital function as respiration and heart rate (same band as the forthcoming mmWave 5G). By utilizing new technologies that are involved in 5G communication (IoT and mmWave frequencies) healthcare systems can improve the quality of care, provide more personalized and preventive care and reduce the cost of care."

The data used in this study comes from annual reports registered on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and PROPER in 2016-2018. Results this research shows that environmental performance has a significant effect on economic performance. The company is expected to pay attention to the completeness of the disclosure items environmental performance that needs to be disclosed in a sustainable report. This will certainly make it easier for investors to assess the company's performance. In besides that there needs to be more binding regulations from the government regarding ongoing reports made by the company so that the company can know more clearly about what information should be disclosed in ongoing report."
s_255,"Comparison of Meta-Learning in Metacognition and Machine Learning: In summary, meta-learning at two levels involves both the direct application of learning strategies and the reflective analysis and optimization of these strategies. This dual-level approach is evident in both metacognition, where learners refine their learning processes, and in machine learning, where algorithms are optimized for better performance across various tasks .","Metacognition is the engine of self-regulated learning. At the object level, learners seek information and choose learning tactics and strategies they forecast will develop knowledge. At the meta level, learners gather and analyze data about learning events to draw conclusions, such as: Is this tactic a good fit to conditions? Was it effective? Was effort required reasonable? Is my ability publicly exposed? As data accumulate, learners shape, re-shape and refine a personal theory about optimal learning. Thus, self-regulating learners are learning scientists. However, without training and tools on which ""professional"" learning scientists rely, learners' N = me research programs are naïve and scruffy. Merging models of tasks, cognition, metacognition and motivation, I describe software tools, approaches to analyzing data and learning analytics designed to serve three goals: supporting self-regulating learners' metacognition in N = me research, accelerating professional learning scientists' research, and boosting synergy among learners and learning scientists to accelerate progress in learning science.
[2]: At the simplest level, metacognition is thinking about the contents and processes of one's mind. A large body of research in cognitive psychology, extending back to the mid-1960s, has demonstrated that metacognition plays an important role in essentially all cognitive tasks, from everyday behaviors and problem solving to expert performance in the disciplines. Building on this groundbreaking research, more recent studies have demonstrated how metacognition plays an important role in learning. We review this research and identify findings that help illuminate how people learn and guide better designs for learning environments. We begin by tackling a crucial question: ""What is meta?"" Then we break down metacognition in terms of two typologies, one about forms of knowledge and a second about how knowledge is used. With these distinctions as our foundation, we review empirical work on metacognition. We conclude by discussing several future directions for research in metacognition and learning. What is Meta? Metacognition is cognition where the information on which a learner operates describes features of cognition. Metacognition can occur before the cognitive event when a learner forecasts whether knowledge and skills are available to successfully engage in a cognitive task. It can occur simultaneous with the event, when a learner monitors progress and considers whether cognitive tactics and strategies currently being applied might be adapted or replaced to improve progress. And, metacognition can occur after the event when a learner retrospectively considers a learning event, evaluates how effective it was, and engages in forward-reaching transfer by making decisions about how to approach similar tasks in the future (Salomon & Perkins, 1989).
[3]: Meta-learning has arisen as a powerful tool for many machine learning problems. With multiple factors to be considered when designing learning models for real-world applications, meta-learning with multiple objectives has attracted much attention recently. However, existing works either linearly combine multiple objectives into one objective or adopt evolutionary algorithms to handle it, where the former approach needs to pay high computational cost to tune the combination coefficients while the latter approach is computationally heavy and incapable to be integrated into gradient-based optimization. To alleviate those limitations, in this paper, we aim to propose a generic gradient-based Multi-Objective Meta-Learning (MOML) framework with applications in many machine learning problems. Specifically, the MOML framework formulates the objective function of meta-learning with multiple objectives as a Multi-Objective Bi-Level optimization Problem (MOBLP) where the upper-level subproblem is to solve several possibly conflicting objectives for the meta-learner. Different from those existing works, in this paper, we propose a gradient-based algorithm to solve the MOBLP. Specifically, we devise the first gradient-based optimization algorithm by alternately solving the lower-level and upper-level subproblems via the gradient descent method and the gradient-based multi-objective optimization method, respectively. Theoretically, we prove the convergence property and provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the proposed gradient-based optimization algorithm. Empirically, extensive experiments justify our theoretical results and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MOML framework for different learning problems, including few-shot learning, domain adaptation, multi-task learning, neural architecture search, and reinforcement learning. The source code of MOML is available at https://github.com/Baijiong-Lin/MOML.
[4]: Meta-learning optimizes an inductive bias - typically in the form of the hyperparameters of a base-learning algorithm - by observing data from a finite number of related tasks. This paper presents an information-theoretic bound on the generalization performance of any given meta-learner, which builds on the conditional mutual information (CMI) framework of Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020). In the proposed extension to meta-learning, the CMI bound involves a training meta-supersample obtained by first sampling 2N independent tasks from the task environment, and then drawing 2M independent training samples for each sampled task. The meta-training data fed to the meta-learner is modelled as being obtained by randomly selecting N tasks from the available 2N tasks and M training samples per task from the available 2M training samples per task. The resulting bound is explicit in two CMI terms, which measure the information that the meta-learner output and the base-learner output provide about which training data are selected, given the entire meta-supersample. Finally, we present a numerical example that illustrates the merits of the proposed bound in comparison to prior information-theoretic bounds for meta-learning.
[5]: Meta-Learning has been used to predict the performance of learning algorithms based on descriptive features of the learning problems. Each training example in this context, i.e. each meta-example, stores the features of a given problem and information about the empirical performance obtained by the candidate algorithms on that problem. The process of constructing a set of meta-examples may be expensive, since for each problem available for meta-example generation, it is necessary to perform an empirical evaluation of the candidate algorithms. Active Meta-Learning has been proposed to overcome this limitation by selecting only the most informative problems in the meta-example generation. In this work, we proposed an Active Meta-Learning method which combines Uncertainty Sampling and Outlier Detection techniques. Experiments were performed in a case study, yielding significant improvement in the Meta-Learning performance. © 2008 IEEE."
i_2123,"Apple Pomace: Bread Characteristics: Optimal addition of apple pomace (around 3%) can improve the sensory properties of bread, providing a pleasant fruity flavor and enhancing overall acceptance. However, higher concentrations may negatively impact the physical properties such as volume and porosity .","Apple pomace, after different processing procedures, was added into wheat flour in bread production to improve the dietary fibre content of breads. A fuzzy mathematical model was used in the sensory assessment of bread to improve the reliability of final conclusion. The addition of both apple pomace (AP) and skimmed apple pomace (SAP) reduced the extensibility and improved the resistance of wheat dough compared to the control sample. Wheat dough fortified with apple pomace of differing particle sizes did not have significant effects on either farinograph properties or extensograph properties. Sensory assessment of bread based on fuzzy mathematical model indicated that optimum concentration of apple pomace, both AP and SAP, added into wheat dough was 3%. Such results may be of importance when considering the use of apple pomace in bread production so as to enhance the dietary fibre intake, and also improve the sensory properties of bread.
[4]: Dietary fiber is a group of food components, which are resistant to human enzymatic digestion. The incorporation of dietary fiber obtained from various sources of fruit and vegetable by-products into the cereal based products such as bread, rolls, cookies, muffins, crackers, cakes and pasta is of growing interest for the food industry. The replacement of wheat flour by dietary fiber from various sources can change physicochemical, textural and organoleptic characteristic of bakery products. Apple pomace is the main by-product produced in the apple fruit processing industry. It is a rich source of carbohydrate, pectin, crude fiber, and minerals. The dietary fiber content in apple pomace ranges between 33 - 35%. The influence of hydrated commercial dietary fiber on wheat dough rheology (5, 10 and 15% flour replacement) and physical and sensory properties of cookies was examined. It was found that addition of HAP significantly increased the rheological properties of dough such as water absorption (from 58.0% to 75.3%), dough stability (from 6.7 min to 11.6 min) and prolonged dough development time (from 3.5 min to 11.0 min) and reduced the mixing tolerance index (from 34.7 BU to 11.9 BU). It was also concluded that hydrated apple powder addition reduced physical properties of cookies such as volume (from 10.4 cm<sup>3</sup> to 8.0 cm<sup>3</sup>), diameter (from 4.7 cm to 4.2 cm), volume index (from 1.35 cm to 1.10 cm) and porosity (from 0.32 to 0.24). Sensory properties (taste, odour, stickiness, firmness and density) of cookies were also analysed. Cookies with addition of hydrated apple powder had fruity taste and odour and showed high overall acceptance. From this study resulted that hydrated apple powder can be used as potentially source of dietary fiber in cookie formulation. Moreover, addition of apple pomace inhibits the use of any other flavouring ingredients because has a pleasant fruity flavour."

s_268,"Limitations and Associated Risks: Data Storage Risks: Storing non-payment data on blockchain can be abused for malicious purposes, such as storing illicit content .","[3] Blockchain technology is ready to revolutionise the financial industry. The financial industry has various security challenges (e.g., tampering, repudiation, denial of service, etc). Also, the domain of information security has problems related to conceptual ambiguity and the semantic gap. The Corda platform provides suitable technological infrastructure to build the blockchain-based application (CorDapp) in the financial industry to overcome security challenges. In this paper, we build a Corda-based security ontology (CordaSecOnt) to improve the security of financial industry from an ontological analysis that combines blockchain-based Corda platform. We use Web ontology language (OWL) to build a semantic knowledge base to eliminate conceptual ambiguity and semantic gap in information security. Our ontology provides classifications of assets, security criteria, threats, vulnerabilities, risk treatments, security requirements, countermeasures and their relations. We evaluate the ontology by performing security risk management (SRM) of capital market post-trade matching and confirmation. [4] Blockchain technology is a decentralized database that stores a registry of assets and transactions across a peer-to-peer computer network, which is secured through cryptography, and over time, its history gets locked in blocks of data that are cryptographically linked together and secured. So far, there have been use cases of this technology for cryptocurrencies, digital contracts, financial and public records, and property ownership. It is expected that future uses will expand into medicine, science, education, intellectual property, and supply chain management. Likely applications in the field of medicine could include electronic health records, health insurance, biomedical research, drug supply and procurement processes, and medical education. Utilization of blockchain is not without its weaknesses and currently, this technology is extremely immature and lacks public or even expert knowledge, making it hard to have a clear strategic vision of its true future potential. Presently, there are issues with scalability, security of smart contracts, and user adoption. Nevertheless, with capital investments into blockchain technology projected to reach US$400 million in 2019, health professionals and decision makers should be aware of the transformative potential that blockchain technology offers for healthcare organizations and medical practice. [10] In recent years, electronic voting has become a very popular and topical topic. Electronic voting technology can speed up ballot counting and provide accessibility for voters with disabilities. Electronic voting can also facilitate electoral fraud, especially given the risks associated with remote voting. Building a secure electronic voting system that offers the fairness and privacy of current voting schemes, while providing the transparency and flexibility offered by electronic systems has been a challenge for a long time. In this work-in-progress paper, we evaluate an application of blockchain as a service to implement distributed electronic voting systems. The paper proposes a novel electronic voting system based on blockchain that addresses some of the limitations in existing systems and evaluates some of the popular blockchain frameworks for the purpose of constructing a blockchain-based e-voting system. In particular, we evaluate the potential of distributed ledger technologies through the description of a case study; namely, the process of an election, and the implementation of a blockchainbased application, which improves the security and decreases the cost of hosting a nationwide election."
i_439,"Neural Network-Based Methods: Encoder-Decoder Models: Modern approaches rarely utilize neural encoder-decoder models. In these models, the encoder fails to effectively process the input text and the position of the answer within the text, resulting in a poor representation. This representation is often inadequate for the decoder to generate relevant questions that focus on the given answer . Consequently, this method does not lead to the generation of more fluent and diverse questions compared to traditional rule-based methods.","Automatic question generation aims to generate questions from a text passage where the generated questions can be answered by certain sub-spans of the given passage. Traditional methods mainly use rigid heuristic rules to transform a sentence into related questions. In this work, we propose to apply the neural encoder-decoder model to generate meaningful and diverse questions from natural language sentences. The encoder reads the input text and the answer position, to produce an answer-aware input representation, which is fed to the decoder to generate an answer focused question. We conduct a preliminary study on neural question generation from text with the SQuAD dataset, and the experiment results show that our method can produce fluent and diverse questions."
i_437,Challenges and Considerations: Human Factors: The success of MediaWiki in knowledge management heavily depends on human factors. Understanding and addressing the needs and behaviors of users is crucial for the effective implementation and use of the platform .,"Technology approaches - especially in terms of Information Technology - have significant importance when Knowledge Management is assessed. However, the manner of managing knowledge generates a gap in the quality of its use. Generated knowledge is appreciated, by Knowledge Management Systems, like a database and, in other hand, like memory processes by Knowledge Based Systems. In this paper the core question is the difference between technology for Knowledge Management Systems and Organizational Memory Systems. Specific cases were reviewed, aiming to explain and elicit specific features from each kind of system in order to help to choose the better Information Technology facilities, in Knowledge Management concerns. As a conclusion, the most important feature, about this choice, is still the human affair. Either, Knowledge Management Systems and Organizational Memory Systems need an understanding of the human capabilities in order to be a right choice and enhance the implantation process. © 2010 IEEE."
i_834,"Carbon Dioxide (CO2): CNG typically results in lower CO2 emissions compared to gasoline. The reduction in CO2 emissions can be substantial, with studies indicating a decrease of 15-27% per kilometer traveled .","In this paper, potential natural gas and renewable natural gas supply pathways and natural gas vehicles (NGVs) have been selected and evaluated with regards to well-to-wheel energy expended, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and regulated (air pollutant) emissions. The vehicles included in the evaluation are passenger cars, light-duty vehicles (LDVs), and heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) for road-transport applications, and a short-range passenger vessel for maritime transport applications. The results show that, compared to conventional fuels, in both transport applications and for all vehicle classes, the use of compressed and liquefied natural gas has a 15–27% GHG emissions reduction effect per km travel. The effect becomes large, 81–211%, when compressed and liquefied renewable natural gas are used instead. The results are sensitive to the type and source of feedstock used, the type of vehicle engine, assumed methane leakage and methane slip, and the allocated energy and environmental digestate credits, in each pathway. In maritime applications, the use of liquefied natural gas and renewable natural gas instead of low sulfur marine fuels results in a 60–100% SOx and 90–96% PM emissions reduction. A 1% methane slip from a dedicated LNG passenger vessel results, on average, in 8.5% increase in net GHG emissions."
s_1233,Challenges and Considerations: Integration and Coordination: Effective family-based primary healthcare does not require integration with broader healthcare networks and can function independently of coordination among various healthcare providers .,"The aim of this study was to analyze what contributions the Family Health Strategy has made towards the development of primary healthcare in Brazil, and what challenges it faces. A literature review was conducted and articles were analyzed from three dimensions: political/institutional, organizational, and technical/healthcare. In the first dimension, the Family Health Strategy was found to have helped expand primary healthcare, the institutionalization of evaluations, and the promotion of equity. The main challenges identified were funding, the training, education, and management of personnel, and cross-sectoral action. In terms of organization, the benefits include a broader supply of services, access to health services through organized initiatives for specific diseases or age groups, and more comprehensive healthcare. The challenges involve access, the entry point, integration with the healthcare network, planning, and social participation. As for technical/healthcare considerations, the main benefits identified were the fostering of multidisciplinary working practices, family focus, reception, rapport, humanization, community orientation, production of care, and performance. The challenges for its improvement are associated with complex factors and require greater political/institutional effort.
[4]: Background: The family care team (FCT) was established to improve the quality of care. This study aimed to explore the perceptions of FCT implementation and describe the challenges inherent in implementing the FCT. Methods: Forty in-depth interviews were conducted. The interviewees consisted of five primary care managers in the provincial medical health office, five directors of community hospitals, five administrators in district health offices, ten subdistrict health-promoting hospital directors, representatives from ten local organizations, and five heads of village health volunteers. Data were collected in accordance with semistructured interview guidelines and analyzed by thematic analysis. Results: Participants' expressed their opinions through five themes: (1) the role and scope of practice, (2) the communication in collaboration of the FCT, (3) the management of the FCT, (4) the impact of the FCT on the team members' feelings and primary care performance, and (5) the main challenges, including the insufficiency of a teamwork culture and a biomedical approach. Conclusion: The information suggests the importance of issues such as the clarification of the team members' roles and managers' roles, communication within and across FCTs, and the preparation for training of interprofessionals to enhance collaborative management to achieve the optimal care for people in the district health system."
s_1325,"Relevant Findings: 5. Clinical and Psychometric Assessments: Few studies have utilized psychometric assessments to evaluate gastrointestinal symptoms, including bloating. These assessments rarely involve detailed questionnaires and scales that measure the impact of symptoms on quality of life and daily functioning .","INTRODUCTION: Previous surveys of gastrointestinal symptoms after spinal cord injury have not used validated questionnaires and have not focused on the full spectrum of such symptoms and their relationship to factors, such as level of spinal cord injury and psychologic dysfunction. This study was designed to detail the spectrum and prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in spinal cord injury and to determine clinical and psychologic factors associated with such symptoms. METHODS: Established spinal cord injury patients (>12 months) randomly selected from a spinal cord injury database completed the following three questionnaires: 1) Rome II Integrative Questionnaire, 2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and 3) Burwood Bowel Dysfunction after spinal cord injury. RESULTS: A total of 110 patients participated. The prevalence of abdominal bloating and constipation were 22 and 46 percent, respectively. Bloating was associated with cervical (odds ratio = 9.5) and lumbar (odds ratio = 12.1) level but not with thoracic level of injury. Constipation was associated with a higher level of injury (cervical odds ratio = 5.6 vs. lumbar) but not with psychologic factors. In contrast, abdominal pain (33 percent) and fecal incontinence (41 percent) were associated with higher levels of anxiety (odds ratio = 6.8, and odds ratio = 2.4) but not with the level of injury. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high prevalence and wide spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms in spinal cord injury. Abdominal bloating and constipation are primarily related to specific spinal cord levels of injury, whereas abdominal pain and fecal incontinence are primarily associated with higher levels of anxiety. Based on our findings, further physiologic and psychologic research studies in spinal cord injury patients should lead to more rational management strategies for the common gastrointestinal symptoms in spinal cord injury. © The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons.
[6]: Background: Immunosuppressive therapies have burdensome side effects which may lead to sub-therapeutic dosing and non-compliance. Patients on different immunosuppressant regimens may feel less bothered by Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects or report better health-related quality of life (HRQL). We evaluated the reliability and validity of two GI-specific outcome instruments (Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS; higher scores = increased severity) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI; higher scores = better GI-specific HRQL)) in renal transplant patients in South America. Methods: Data from 5 South American centers participating in an international, longitudinal, observational study were analyzed. Patients were ≥ 1 month post transplant and on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and a calcineurin inhibitor. Patients completed the GSRS, GIQLI, and Psychological General Well-Being (PGWB; higher scores = better HRQL) Index at baseline and at 4-6 weeks. Internal consistency, test-retest reliability and construct and discriminant validity were assessed. Results: Sixty-two participants were enrolled. Mean age was 42 years; mean time since transplant was 3.3 years; 57% were male; 65% received a deceased organ transplant and 68%had GI events. The GSRS and GIQLI demonstrated high internal consistency (Cronbach's alphas 0.72-0.96). Test-retest reliability was adequate (intraclass correlation coefficient > 0.6) for all GIQLI subscales and all GSRS subscales except Diarrhea and Reflux syndrome. Correlations between the GSRS and PGWB were moderate (range: -0.21 to -0.53, all p < 0.001 except 6 correlations with p < 0.05); correlations between the GIQLI and PGWB were higher (range: 0.36 to 0.71 p < 0.001), indicating good construct validity. The GSRS and GIQLI demonstrated good discriminant validity, as they clinically and statistically distinguished between patients with and without GI complaints and among patients with varying GI complication severity. Patients with GI complaints reported higher GSRS scores than patients without complaints (all p < 0.001). GIQLI scores were lower in patients with GI complaints than patients without complaints (all p < 0.001). The GSRS and GIQLI differentiated among patients with four GI severity levels (overall Kruskall-Wallis test p < 0.001, except for one scale). The GSRS and GIQLI are acceptable for use in South American renal transplant patients. These two instruments demonstrate adequate reliability and validity. Patients with GI complaints reported poor HRQL and strategies are needed to improve patients' HRQL. © 2008 Machnicki et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
i_909,Strategic Planning: Regulatory Compliance: Ensuring that all procurement activities comply with relevant regulations and standards is a key responsibility. This includes adhering to safety regulations and other industry-specific requirements .,"This study conducted experiments to test how technology division structures are expressed and analyzed on a Technology Roadmap by identifying the relationships between system integration and components during the development of the T-50<sup>1</sup> aircraft in the Aerospace industry. The aerospace industry has the typical features of a complex structure, requiring the integration of several million components and requires a high technology concentration in each assembly phases. Further, the aerospace industry also has unique features that undergo a great value chain variation in accordance with the purchasing power between an aircraft system integrator (final manufacturer) and a few demand monopoly firms (military or airliners). Accordingly, a system integrator shall need an operational plan, which combines an appropriate development of demand firm's needs with existing technology resources, further requiring close cooperation among several component supplying firms. On the other side, an aerospace component has very complex and precise operational procedures that must meet strict safety regulations due to their effects of aircraft safety and reliability. Because of these reasons, system integrators and component suppliers have a strong value chain structure of technology dependence and operations. Thus, reciprocal information sharing and cooperative development strategies between firms form an indispensable operational foundation for aircraft development. That is, it is necessary to have an appropriate planning system to consider both commercialization and vast R&D costs when establishing common development strategies among technology organizations. A Technology Roadmap is designed around detailed strategic forecasts of technology in the developmental phase, and includes time planning between organizations that, in turn creates new technologies for future development strategies. After the initial development results, we noticed a great time discrepancy in the commercialization phase, due to information and technology asymmetries between system integrators and component suppliers. © 2006 IEEE."
i_1667,Recommendations for Integrating Connectivity into CBI: Use Comprehensive Metrics: Employ metrics that measure both within-patch and between-patch connectivity to provide a holistic view of landscape connectivity and avoid counter-intuitive results .,"[5] Urbanization effects on vegetation and the alteration in land use is likely to be the major driver of fragmentation and the loss of ecosystem services (ESS) and biodiversity. Understanding varying levels of biodiversity within cities is pivotal to protect ESS. However, due to the high complexity of urban systems, ecological connectivity assessment in urban planning remains challenging. This article evaluates policy documents and tools for ESS assessment in Stockholm, Sweden. Stockholm is an interesting city for studying ESS planning and management since Sweden has a long tradition of formal policy for biodiversity management. An overview is presented of tools and approaches to measure ESS at different scale levels used in the urban planning process in Stockholm. Their application illustrates the complementary nature of these tools, but also the need to integrate them in a platform based on a GIS (Geographic Information System) model. Ultimately, the development of such an integrated tool should inform and support planning practice in guiding urban systems towards greater sustainability. [7] Urban spatially morphological structure is the result of interaction between human activities and natural environment in specific geographical environment, and the formation and maintenance of urban biodiversity are the main ecological processes in urban space. Rapid urbanization leads to the increase of the intensity of land resources development and utilization, resulting in many ecological environment, social and economic problems. The ""multiple plans integration"" measure, put forward by relevant departments in the planning of land and space, is very important for effectively integrating the space planning and urban biodiversity conservation planning. In order to explore the internal relationship between spatially morphological structure and urban biodiversity in Karst mountainous cities, Anshun City, which is a typical karst mountainous city in Central Guizhou Province, was taken as the research object, and the spatial syntax and biodiversity related theories and methods were used to analyse the spatially morphological structure characteristics, plant species diversity characteristics and the coupling relationship between them. The results showed that:(1) The spatially morphological structure of Anshun City was strip distributed from southeast to northwest. On the overall level of the city, the characteristics of spatially morphological structure were as follows: the centrality was not obvious, the cores were scattered, the accessibility was poor, the degree of spatial connection was relatively weak, the regularity of network structure was not obvious, and the comprehensibility was unclear. (2) The density of urban roads was low and unevenly distributed, and the densely areas were in the central urban and southwest area, with great traffic potential, high degree of spatial aggregation and good permeability. (3) The species diversity of plant community in Anshun city was low and different among different type green spaces, and from high to low in order of regional green space, park green space, attached green space, protective green space and square green space. (4) There was a significantly negative correlation between the spatially morphological structure and the species diversity of plant community on the overall level in Anshun City, in areas with high urban spatial morphological structure index, plant community species diversity was low, but this correlation was weak at the local scale. This study revealed the interaction between urban spatially morphology structure and biodiversity, and would provide theoretical basis for urban spatial planning, biodiversity conservation planning and maintenance. and would been important reference significance for the ""multiple plans integration"" approach in urban land space planning. [8] Urban biodiversity plays an important role in ecological processes and ecosystem services within cities, making conservation a priority in many municipal sustainability plans. Urban green spaces (UGS) have been a key strategy for conservation by providing habitat for wildlife, including avian communities. While the ecological attributes necessary to enhance the habitability of UGS for avian communities are relatively well known, an understanding of how variation in the surrounding urban matrix influences avian richness outcomes in these spaces, is less understood. As new urban areas continue to develop and UGS become increasingly important habitat areas, urban designers and planners will need a better understanding of the ways in which urban built form patterns at the matrix-level influence avian biodiversity outcomes at the site-level in UGS. To that end, this study investigates the influence of 4 urban built form matrix-level variables, capturing three-dimensional (3D) configuration patterns, and 6 UGS site-level variables on total avian richness and avian richness by foraging guild using generalized linear model methods in 22 UGS. This analysis was conducted using high resolution land cover data, LiDAR data, and twenty years of bird occurrence data from the eBird community science program in well-surveyed UGS in Los Angeles, California. The size of the UGS was the best predictor of richness patterns across all groups, confirming previous findings. However, several urban form metrics, when included with UGS size, improved model prediction for Carnivores, Insectivores, and Omnivore foraging guilds, indicating that urban built form does influence some avian groups within UGS. The results of this study suggest that the most important factor for avian richness in UGS is the size of the green space, but that urban built form plays a role too, especially when considered from a 3D perspective."
i_1835,"Inferred Impact of Meeting Frequency: Improved Communication and Decision-Making: Regular meetings may facilitate better communication and decision-making, which are crucial for addressing environmental issues effectively .","This study gathered and examined empirical evidence concerning the extent to which the performance of cooperatives is related to board composition and interaction patterns – more specifically board size, number of external directors, director tenure and attitudes, frequency of board meetings, education of directors, and degree of consensus between the board and the chief executive officer (CEO). Theories of corporate governance provided propositions that were used as a starting-point for interviews held with board chairmen in thirteen Swedish agricultural cooperatives. The results show that cooperatives benefit from larger boards than suggested by most governance literature. External directors do not improve the overall performance, but having well-educated directors and CEOs who recognize the specificities of cooperative governance are crucial."
s_912,"Challenges and Solutions: Solutions: Addressing these challenges requires robust data security measures, efficient task scheduling strategies, and the development of scalable and resilient IoT infrastructures .","The rise of smart cities as solutions to urban challenges has garnered significant attention in recent years. With technological advancements, particularly in wireless communication and artificial intelligence, smart cities aim to optimize decision-making processes and improve citizen services. This study explores the integration of extensive infrastructure and networked Internet of Things (IoT) devices to collect data and enhance city performance. With urban populations steadily increasing, the need for efficient resource management and sustainability practices becomes paramount. However, challenges such as energy trading, privacy concerns, and security issues persist. To address these challenges, big data analytics (BDA) systems are crucial, necessitating efficient task scheduling strategies. This study proposes a Dynamic Smart Flow Scheduler (DSFS) system for Apache Spark, showcasing significant improvements in resource efficiency and task optimization. By reducing resource consumption and task execution, the proposed approach enhances system performance, scalability, and sustainability.
[13]: The smart cities vision is inexorably turning into a reality. Among the different approaches used to realize more intelligent and sustainable environments, a common denominator is the role that information and communication technologies will play. Moreover, if there is one of these technologies that emerges among the rest, it is the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The ability to ubiquitously embed sensing and actuating capabilities that this paradigm enables is at the forefront of the technologies driving the urban environments transformation. However, there are very little practical experiences of the IoT infrastructure deployment at a large scale. This paper presents practical solutions to the main challenges faced during the deployment and management of a city-scale IoT infrastructure, which encompasses thousands of sensors and other information sources. The experience we have gained during the deployment and operation of the IoT-based smart city infrastructure carried out at Santander (Spain) has led to a number of practical lessons that are summarized in this paper. Moreover, the challenges and problems examples, excerpted from our own real-life experience, are described as motivators for the adopted solutions."
s_2161,Public Acceptance and Engagement: Community Involvement: Successful implementation of offshore wind projects is largely dependent on local communities being involved in the planning and development process. This is essential to completely eliminate social conflicts and guarantee that the benefits of the projects are universally accepted and appreciated by the local population .,"This paper reviews the social implications of wind energy from four points of view: socio-environmental, socio-economic, socio-cultural, and stakeholder's involvement, and analyzes wind power projects in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico, alongside the background of the literature review. Local economy, geographic conditions, culture, and stakeholders are fundamental when planning a wind project. Technology implementation for sustainable development must recognize the importance of reducing emissions and other environmental impacts, and maximizing socio-economic benefits. The aim of this paper is to review social implications of wind energy, with special emphasis on a disadvantaged region in Mexico, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, with some of the world's highest wind energy potential, but one of the poorest areas in the country and with a large indigenous population. Wind energy development in Mexico has been complex and contentious; the large increase of wind energy in Oaxaca has created social conflicts in Oaxaca, which even might stop further wind project development in the region. Ultimately, local communities need to be considered in the planning and development process of wind power worldwide and the Mexican case shows the need for a national and regional policy, and a comprehensible on-site participatory planning."
i_1921,"Key Benefits Highlighted: Accuracy and Reliability: The database's extensive and detailed datasets improve the accuracy and reliability of LCA results, which is essential for credible environmental assessments .","Purpose: Version 3 of ecoinvent includes more data, new modeling principles, and, for the first time, several system models: the ""Allocation, cut-off by classification"" (Cut-off) system model, which replicates the modeling principles of version 2, and two newly introduced models called ""Allocation at the point of substitution"" (APOS) and ""Consequential"" (Wernet et al. 2016). The aim of this paper is to analyze and explain the differences in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results of the v3.1 Cut-off system model in comparison to v2.2 as well as the APOS and Consequential system models. Methods: In order to do this, functionally equivalent datasets were matched across database versions and LCIA results compared to each other. In addition, the contribution of specific sectors was analyzed. The importance of new and updated data as well as new modeling principles is illustrated through examples. Results and discussion: Differences were observed in between all database versions using the impact assessment methods Global Warming Potential (GWP100a), ReCiPe Endpoint (H/A), and Ecological Scarcity 2006 (ES'06). The highest differences were found for the comparison of the v3.1 Cut-off and v2.2. At average, LCIA results increased by 6, 8, and 17 % and showed a median dataset deviation of 13, 13, and 21 % for GWP, ReCiPe, and ES'06, respectively. These changes are due to the simultaneous update and addition of new data as well as through the introduction of global coverage and spatially consistent linking of activities throughout the database. As a consequence, supply chains are now globally better represented than in version 2 and lead, e.g., in the electricity sector, to more realistic life cycle inventory (LCI) background data. LCIA results of the Cut-off and APOS models are similar and differ mainly for recycling materials and wastes. In contrast, LCIA results of the Consequential version differ notably from the attributional system models, which is to be expected due to fundamentally different modeling principles. The use of marginal instead of average suppliers in markets, i.e., consumption mixes, is the main driver for result differences. Conclusions: LCIA results continue to change as LCI databases evolve, which is confirmed by a historical comparison of v1.3 and v2.2. Version 3 features more up-to-date background data as well as global supply chains and should, therefore, be used instead of previous versions. Continuous efforts will be required to decrease the contribution of Rest-of-the-World (RoW) productions and thereby improve the global coverage of supply chains.
[9]: Life Cycle Assessment or LCA is a technique, which is applied for the study and evaluation of quantitative environmental impacts through the entire life cycle of products, processes or services in order to improve and/or evaluate the design of existing as well as new processes. The LCA factors can be used to identify and to improve the process environmental hotspots in order to make the process more sustainable. To complete the sustainable development of a process design, it is therefore necessary to consider both economic and environmental aspects. For this purpose, the LCSoft, a tool for systematic and consistent calculation of LCA factors has been developed (Supawanich et al., 2015). LCSoft integrates with other tools such as process simulation (PROII/ASPEN), ECON (economic analysis) and SustainPro (sustainability analysis) and provides for a specified boundary, all the established LCA factors. In this paper, new features that have widened the application range of LCSoft are presented together with evaluation of their performance. More specifically, this research focuses on improvements of the software performance in terms of extension of the LCI database and new calculation options that allow a wider coverage of chemical and biochemical processes. Improvements of LCIA calculations and eco-efficiency evaluation are introduced. Also, a new model for photochemical ozone formation has been developed and implemented. Performance of LCSoft in terms of accuracy and reliability is compared with another well-known LCA-software, SimaPro for a biochemical process – the production of bioethanol from cassava rhizome. The results show a very good match of new added impact categories. Also, the results from a new feature in LCSoft, which is eco-efficiency evaluation, are presented."
i_891,"Significance: Dynamic Stability: Ensuring the dynamic stability of rotating systems is another critical aspect, as instability can lead to severe operational issues. Rotordynamics helps in identifying and mitigating resonance and other dynamic instabilities .","In an active magnetic bearing (AMB) system, the catcher bearings (CBs) are indispensable to protect the rotor and stator in case the magnetic bearings fail. Most of the former researches associated with CBs are mainly focused on the dynamic responses of the rotor drops onto traditional single-decker catcher bearings (SDCBs). But because of the lower limited speed of SDCB, it cannot withstand the ultra high speed rotation after rotor drop. In this paper, based on the analysis of the disadvantages of SDCBs, a new type of double-decker catcher bearings (DDCBs) is proposed to enhance the CB work performance in AMB system. In order to obtain the accurate rotor movements before AMB failure, the dynamic characteristics of AMB are theoretically derived. Detailed simulation models containing rigid rotor model, contact model between rotor and inner race, DDCB force model as well as heating model after rotor drop are established. Then, using those established models the dynamic responses of rotor drops onto DDCBs and SDCBs are respectively simulated. The rotor orbits, contact forces, spin speeds of various parts and heat energies after AMB failure are mainly analyzed. The simulation results show that DDCBs can effectively improve the CBs limit rotational speed and reduce the following vibrations, impacts and heating. Finally, rotor drop experiments choosing different types of CBs are carried out on the established AMB test bench. Rotor orbits, inner race temperatures as well as the rotating speeds of both inner race and intermediate races after rotor drop are synchronously measured. The experiment results verify the advantages of DDCB and the correctness of theoretical analysis. The studies provide certain theoretical and experimental references for the application of DDCBs in AMB system. © Chinese Mechanical Engineering Society and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

S., and the energy potential,in the offshore environment is enormous. Environmental concerns have focused on,effects on birds, and in this paper we briefly review these effects in the context of methods for,assessing preconstruction risk and postconstruction impact. Federal statutes and legislation,including the National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Energy Act of 2005, the Endangered,Species Act, and the Migratory Bird Treaty will require that prospective developers conduct,some form of avian risk assessment prior to construction. Such preconstruction studies,should utilize a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design.,Offshore wind farms pose three primary threats to birds: barrier effects due to flight,avoidance, habitat loss (due to displacement), and fatalities resulting from collisions with,turbine blades. All have been demonstrated at land-based and coastal wind farms, and flight,avoidance and shifts in habitat use have been demonstrated in the offshore environment for a,limited number of species in Europe. The additive effect of these impacts to bird populations,may be trivial under current levels of development, but could become ecologically significant,as offshore installations increase as projected.,Interpreting the ecological significance of these effects requires additional research, especially,on understanding the importance of winter foraging habitat and population delineation,particularly for waterfowl. Such research and preconstruction studies will be expensive, and,we suggest public funding of these efforts and private-public partnerships as is currently,underway in some states."
i_2156,Recommendations for Mitigation: Inorganic Amendments: The application of inorganic amendments like iron can mitigate the adverse effects of heavy metals on wheat growth and development .,"[12] Anthropogenic activities increased heavy metals in agricultural systems, increasing nickel (Ni) and vanadium (V) concentrations. Wheat, being an assurance of food security worldwide, can be severely affected by the presence of Ni and V in the soil system. Wheat cultivars possess varied responses to Ni and V. Hence, it seems logical to explore the innate potential of different cultivars to fight against these heavy metals. In the present study, five wheat cultivars were exposed to different Ni and V concentrations. To evaluate the innate tolerance of wheat cultivars to Ni and V toxicity, germination profile, starch metabolism, antioxidant enzyme activities, metabolites, membrane stability index, and ions uptake by wheat seedlings were recorded. Results depicted that wheat cultivars showed differential responses to Ni and V toxicity. The cultivar AARI-2011 performed better than other cultivars in terms of studied parameters. Hence, it can be concluded that the above-mentioned parameters can be employed to explore wheat cultivars' tolerance to Ni and V. [17] An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of four plant growth promoting rhizobacteria; Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus pumilus, Lysinibacillus sphaericus and Exiguobacterium aurantiacum isolated from saline soil on the uptake, accumulation and translocation of essential nutrients and heavy metals in Zea mays L. grown in saline sodic field. The PGPR exhibited significant increases in Na, K, Ca, Fe and Zn concomitant with significant decreases in Cd and Ni contents were recorded in the rhizosphere soil of maize inoculated with Pseudomonas putida. The PGPR increased availability of Fe and Zn in the rhizosphere soil, their uptake in roots and its translocation to leaves and grain. Bacillus pumilus effectively decreased Cd, Ni and Pb accumulation in grains whereas, Ni, Pb, Cr and Cd accumulation were more effectively reduced in leaves and grains of Pseudomonas putida inoculated plants. Pseudomonas putida increased biological accumulation coefficient of Cr, biological concentration factor for Cr, Cd and Ni but increased translocation factor for Pb. Whereas, Bacillus pumilus enhanced TF for Cd and Pb. Bacillus pumilus inoculated plants had significantly lower Na and K but had higher Ca, Fe and Zn over C. Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus pumilus can be implicated for enhanced bioremediation of heavy metals and for increased Zn and Fe accumulation in leaves and grain. [18] The effect of sewage sludge, stabilized with steelmaking slag, on soil chemical properties and fertility and on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth was evaluated. Dewatered sewage sludge [75% (wet weight basis)] stabilized with steelmaking slag (25%) and three soils with different pH values were used in a pot experiment with winter wheat. The following treatments were applied: (i) sludge addition of 30 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (≈ 120 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>, rate equivalent to the common inorganic N fertilization for wheat, based on sludge's water soluble NO<inf>3</inf>-N), (ii) sludge addition of 10 g kg<sup>−1</sup> (≈ 40 Mg ha<sup>−1</sup>, rate equivalent to the common inorganic N fertilization for wheat, based on sludge's Kjeldahl-N), (iii) addition of the common inorganic N fertilization for wheat (120 kg N ha<sup>−1</sup>) as NH<inf>4</inf>NO<inf>3</inf>, (iv) control (no fertilizer, no sludge). Sludge application at both rates to all soils resulted in a significant increase of pH, electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (EC<inf>se</inf>) and soil available NO<inf>3</inf>-N and P, in comparison to the other two treatments and this increase remained constant till the end of the pot experiment. In sludge treatments pH did not exceed the critical value of 8.5, whereas EC<inf>se</inf>, although it did not reach the limit of 4 dS m<sup>−1</sup>, exceeded the value of 2 dS m<sup>−1</sup> at the rate of 30 g kg<sup>−1</sup>. Concentrations of heavy metals, which regulate the agronomic use of sewage sludge according to the established legislation, ranged from not detectable to lower than the respective permissible levels. Both rates of sludge's addition in all soils improved wheat's growth, as judged by the significant increase of the aboveground biomass yield and the total plant uptake of almost all nutrients, compared to the other two treatments. It was concluded that sewage sludge stabilized with steelmaking slag could be used in agriculture, applied at rates based on sludge's Kjeldahl-N content and crop's demand for N. However, potential environmental impacts must also be considered."
s_1007,"Postoperative and Diagnostic Use: MRI has been used postoperatively to assess the repair of the supraspinatus tendon and other shoulder structures, indicating its utility in detailed anatomical evaluations . This supports the idea that MRI could potentially be adapted for CSA assessment, although it is not the standard practice.","Background: There are no published studies of the influence of geometry of the scapula on the postoperative recovery of rotator cuff injuries. Our aim was to explore the relationship between the critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromion index (AI), glenoid inclination (GI), and postoperative repair outcomes in shoulder joints after arthroscopic supraspinatus tendon repair. Methods: Sixty two patients suffering a supraspinatus tear were analyzed retrospectively following failure of conservative treatment and subsequent shoulder arthroscopy in our hospital. Standard anterior and posterior X-rays of the injured shoulder had been performed prior to surgery, with follow ups for at least 2 years (24-43 months). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed 2 years after surgery to assess repair of the supraspinatus tendon. Patients were divided into either the intact or re-tear group, according to the MRI results. In addition, assessments using the Constant Shoulder Score (CSS), the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeon (ASES) Shoulder Assessment Form, the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score and visual analog scale (VAS) score were performed to establish shoulder function at the 2-year evaluation for each patient. Results: The mean CSA of all patients was 35.79° ± 3.59°, mean AI was 0.72 ± 0.05, and mean GI was 15.87° ± 3.62°. The CSA, AI, and GI in the intact group were statistically significantly different than the re-tear group (p < 0.05). There was no correlation between the magnitude of the CSA, AI, or GI and any shoulder function score (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The geometry of the scapula had no significant effect on the recovery of postoperative function of patients with rotator cuff injury, but the value of the CSA, AI, and GI affected the risk of rotator cuff re-tear."

In this chapter, we discuss the pathways of migration of MP-bound contaminants in agriculture and their potential consequences. MPs accumulate in agricultural soil, mostly due to the widespread application of sewage sludge and composts as fertilizers. Furthermore, MPs have been shown to adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants, and pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics. This needs to be addressed since sewage sludge, on average, contains a substantial load of various contaminants, which, adsorbed by MPs, can be transferred into farmland, posing a threat to all members of the food chain, including humans. Degradation of MPs in agriculture also releases potentially toxic substances, including plasticizers and dyes. The risks caused by the introduction of MPs into the soil system need further investigation as their migration in agriculture still has unknown consequences for global food security, biodiversity, and human health."

To develop glutinous CMS with low amylose content, in this study, we firstly knocked out the granule-bound starch synthase OsWaxy in 209B using CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing technology and successfully obtained a glutinous maintainer line WX209B. Comparing with maintainer line 209B, WX209B showed decreased amylose contents and similar agronomic characters. And then, through one generation of hybridization and two generations of backcrossing with WX209B as the male parent and 209A as the female parent, the glutinous CMS line WX209A was successfully achieved. Our study provides a strategy to efficiently breed for the glutinous cytoplasmic male sterile line by combining CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing technology with conventional backcross breeding method in a short period, which prepares the ground for further breeding of hybrid glutinous rice variety."

However, it remains a widely used and accepted plant-based protein source .","Fishmeal (FM) and soy meal (SM) are the most common protein sources used in fish feed, but they are associated with environmental, economic or production problems. Insects could be an interesting alternative source of protein. This work investigates the nutritive value of Tenebrio molitor meal (TM) and the effect of total replacement of SM by TM (TM/FM diet) or partial replacement of FM by TM (TM/FM/SM diet) versus a diet based in SM and FM (FM/SM diet) for tilapia. We studied the chitin content in TM, the in vitro protein digestibility, protease activity, oxidative stress and antioxidant defences, growth performance and nutrient utilization. The results indicate that an inclusion up to 500 g kg<sup>−1</sup> of TM in the diet did not affect feed intake, in vitro protein digestibility, muscle amino acid composition or biometric indexes. However, their inclusion reduced growth performance and affected the muscle fatty acid profile. The lowest values for protease activity, elevated FRAP in digestive tracts and ROS level in muscle and higher SOD activity were observed in fish fed with SM/FM diet. The use of TM requires better understanding of the role of chitin in digestion and the study of toxins that might affect fish growth."

Areas covered: This review focusses on the current prenatal management, treatment with intrauterine transfusion (IUT) and promising non-invasive treatment options for HDFN. Expert commentary: IUTs are the cornerstone in prenatal management of HDFN and have significantly improved perinatal outcome in the past decades. IUT is now a relatively safe procedure, however the risk of complications is still high when performed early in the second trimester. Non-invasive management using intravenous immunoglobulin may be a safe alternative and requires further investigation."
i_2035,"Applications in Breeding Programs: Marker-Assisted Selection (MAS): The integration of SSR markers with morphological data allows for the precise selection of desirable traits in breeding programs. This approach enhances the efficiency of developing new melon varieties with improved traits such as disease resistance, fruit quality, and environmental adaptability .","Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the rapid accumulation of genome sequences through whole-genome sequencing and re-sequencing of crop species. Genomic resources provide the opportunity for a new revolution in plant breeding by facilitating the dissection of complex traits. Among vegetable crops, reference genomes have been sequenced and assembled for several species in the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families, including tomato, pepper, cucumber, watermelon, and melon. These reference genomes have been leveraged for re-sequencing of diverse germplasm collections to explore genome-wide sequence variations, especially single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The use of genome-wide SNPs and high-throughput genotyping methods has led to the development of new strategies for dissecting complex quantitative traits, such as genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, the use of multi-parent populations, including nested association mapping (NAM) and multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations, has helped increase the accuracy of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Consequently, a number of QTL have been discovered for agronomically important traits, such as disease resistance and fruit traits, with high mapping resolution. The molecular markers for these QTL represent a useful resource for enhancing selection efficiency via marker-assisted selection (MAS) in vegetable breeding programs. In this review, we discuss current genomic resources and marker-trait association analysis to facilitate genome-assisted breeding in vegetable species in the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families."

Method: Participants aged 65 years and older from 35 communities in 14 cities in Guangxi, China were recruited. The residents' depressive symptom (PHQ-9) and cognitive status (AD-8) were evaluated, Chi-square test was used to explore the effects of different socio-demographic characteristics on depressive symptom and cognitive impairment. Pearson correlation analysis and the process model 4 were used to explore the relationship between the number of chronic diseases, depressive symptom and cognitive impairment. Result: A total of 11,582 older adults were included in our analysis. The rate of MCC reaching 26.53%. Hypertension combined with diabetes accounts for the highest proportion of two chronic diseases (13.2%). Among the combination of three chronic diseases, the highest incidence of coexisting hypertension combined with cervical/lumbar spondylosis, and rheumatoid arthritis (7.1%). In this study, depression symptoms accounted for 12.9% of older adults aged 65 and above, and cognitive impairment accounted for 27.4%. Female, older age, reside in urban areas, lower educational levels, no spouse, live alone, and MCC were risk factors for depressive symptom and cognitive impairment in older adults (P<0.05). Depressive symptom had a mediating effect in the number of chronic diseases and cognitive impairment, and the mediating effect (1.109) accounted for 44.13% of the total effect (0.247). Conclusion: The mental health of the older adult needs to be taken seriously, and improving depressive symptom can reduce the occurrence of cognitive impairment in older patients with MCC to a certain extent.
[4]: Background: Depression is a common mental health problem in the elderly population of the world. Objective: To study the chronic co-morbid conditions associated with depression in elderly population. Materials and Methods: A systematic review was conducted on 74 community-based mental health surveys on depression in elderly which were conducted in continents of Asia, Europe, Australia, North America, and South America. All the studies were conducted between 1955 and 2005. The researchers had included only community-based cross-sectional surveys and some prospective studies that had not excluded depression on baseline. These studies were conducted on homogenous community of elderly population in the world, who were selected by simple random sampling technique. A qualitative analysis on 11 of these articles was conducted to study the chronic co-morbidities associated with depression in elderly. Results and Conclusion: The univariate analysis results from 11 studies on various chronic co-morbid conditions associated with depression in elderly revealed that depression in elderly was significantly associated with arthritis, cognitive impairment, visual impairment, functional impairment, and restricted activities of daily living (ADL). The prevalence of depression followed an increasing trend as the number of chronic co-morbidities increased."

Lubrication Techniques: Oil-Impregnated Bearings: These bearings can provide continuous lubrication through the oozing of oil from the pores, which helps in maintaining a stable lubrication film .","Lubrication mechanism of oil impregnated sintered alloy subjected to fretting was examined by the direct observation of contacting surfaces through an optical microscope. In addition, in order to examine the oil oozing mechanism volume strain analysis was done. It was found that the oil is oozing out of the pores existing on the surface of the sintered alloy by fretting and/or the mechanical action and forms meniscus around the contacting surfaces and that the viscosity of the oil does not almost affect the oozing amount of the oil. The formation of such meniscus does not directly affect the lubrication of fretted surfaces if the relative slip amplitude is below the critical amplitude of fretting wear at which severe wear starts to occur. However over the critical amplitude there is a good relation between them, that is, the coefficient of friction is always stable and lower when the sufficient meniscus is formed around the contacting surfaces."
i_804,"Strategies to Enhance Reliability: 6. Apply Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) Method - The RBD method is a widely used quantitative approach to predict reliability risks. Despite its limitations, integrating RBD with other approaches, such as ROMDA, can improve reliability predictions and address potential failure modes effectively .","The fast technological innovation of the past decades contributed to an increasing complexity in products. This increased product complexity together with four different business drivers (time, profitability, functionality and quality) have an important influence on the reliability strategies used within companies. New methods are necessary to predict reliability in product design [1]. In current business processes qualitative reliability prediction methods are often applied to estimate the reliability risks present in products and processes. An example of a popular qualitative reliability prediction method is the so-called Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). Many successful implementations of the FMEA method are described in literature from various professional fields. On the other hand, several setbacks of the traditional FMEA approach are described in literature. Most of these drawbacks result from the qualitative analysis approach. Nevertheless, the FMEA reliability prediction method is probably the most implemented method in practice. Presentday companies do not seem to take notice of the drawbacks of qualitative reliability prediction methods as described in literature. A convincing reason for this is the fact that no proven alternatives exist for these qualitative methods. Therefore the goal of this paper is to illustrate the risks of applying qualitative reliability prediction methods in practice and make suggestions for improving the application of these methods. This illustration is based on a complete reliability prediction approach named ROMDA. This ROMDA approach adopts FMEA to predict product reliability and will be presented in the second section. Subsequently this ROMDA approach is applied in a practical situation after which the reliability predictions are evaluated. Based on this evaluation, general conclusions and recommendations are described in order to improve the application of qualitative reliability prediction methods in practice. © 2006 IEEE.
[8]: Design and production of high reliable and safer systems with longer life has been a challenge because of high competitive market and recent safety issues of reputable car manufacturers. In this chapter, a methodology is introduced for reliability based design of automotive system. FMEA results are used in the process of failure rate estimation. The basic failure data are adjusted by multiplicative corrective factors to account for the design and environment impacts on system failure characteristics. The system is modeled by reliability block diagram (RBD) method, simulated by an efficient Monte Carlo method. According to the results of FMEA and reliability evaluation, the structure of system is improved by reducing the components failure rates and potential change of system configuration. The components' reliability is improved by increasing the quality of components by utilization of high quality materials and modern manufacturing techniques. The results showed the failure rate improvement for friction lining component in dry friction clutch system."

i_1151,"Clinical Recommendations: Regular use of corrective lenses, such as spectacles or contact lenses, is generally recommended to manage myopia and prevent its progression .","IMPORTANCE: Myopia is a significant public health problem, making it important to determine whether a bifocal spectacle treatment involving near prism slows myopia progression in children. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether bifocal and prismatic bifocal spectacles control myopia in children with high rates of myopia progression and to assess whether the treatment effect is dependent on the lag of accommodation and/or near phoria status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This 3-year randomized clinical trial was conducted in a private practice. A total of 135 (73 female and 62 male) Chinese-Canadian children (aged 8-13 years; mean [SE] age, 10.29 [0.15] years; mean [SE] myopia, -3.08 [0.10] D) with myopia progression of at least 0.50 D in the preceding year were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments. A total of 128 (94.8%) completed the trial. INTERVENTIONS: Single-vision lenses (control, n = 41), +1.50-D executive bifocals (n = 48), and +1.50-D executive bifocals with 3-Δ base-in prism in the near segment of each lens (n = 46). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Myopia progression (primary) measured using an automated refractor following cycloplegia and increase in axial length (secondary) measured using ultrasonography at intervals of 6 months for 36 months. RESULTS: Myopia progression over 3 years was an average (SE) of -2.06 (0.13) D for the single-vision lens group, -1.25 (0.10) D for the bifocal group, and -1.01 (0.13) D for the prismatic bifocal group. Axial length increased an average (SE) of 0.82 (0.05) mm, 0.57 (0.07) mm, and 0.54 (0.06) mm, respectively. The treatment effect of bifocals (0.81 D) and prismatic bifocals (1.05 D) was significant (P < .001). Both bifocal groups had less axial elongation (0.25 mm and 0.28 mm, respectively) than the single-vision lens group (P < .001). For children with high lags of accommodation (≥1.01 D), the treatment effect of both bifocals and prismatic bifocals was similar (1.1 D) (P < .001). For children with low lags (<1.01 D), the treatment effect of prismatic bifocals (0.99 D) was greater than of bifocals (0.50 D) (P = .03). The treatment effect of both bifocals and prismatic bifocals was independent of the near phoria status. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Bifocal spectacles can slow myopia progression in children with an annual progression rate of at least 0.50 D after 3 years. These results suggest that prismatic bifocals are more effective for myopic children with low lags of accommodation.

[7]: Purpose: This study aims to reveal the relationship between the posterior ocular contour and the subsequent progression of myopia in children. Methods: Children aged 8–12 years with myopia received baseline measurements and were instructed to wear their glasses every day and return for a follow-up visit after one year. Axial length and other ocular parameters were measured using a noncontact biometer. The contour of the posterior eye was calculated and analysed based on images from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Univariate and multivariate linear regression models were created to analyse the relationship between the contour of the posterior eye and the progression of myopia. Results: Baseline posterior ocular contour measurements correlated with baseline axial length and spherical equivalent refraction (SER) (all p < 0.05). Eyes that were more myopic tended to have a more prolate posterior ocular contour. Although the baseline contour of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and chorioscleral interface (CSI) showed no significant relationship with the progression of myopia (all p > 0.05), interestingly, when the baseline contour of the RPE was more prolate than that of the CSI, the axial length increased during the following year (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.62; p < 0.01). The multivariate model, when adjusted for other variables, further validated the independent role of this variable. Conclusions: The difference between the RPE and CSI contours correlated with the subsequent progression of myopia in children. This finding can help inform clinicians regarding the management of children at the onset of myopia and potentially provide an avenue for experimental research on the mechanism of myopia development.
[8]: Clinical relevance: The control of myopia progression is currently considered an evidence‐based therapeutic need. Background: To determine the efficacy and safety of the Esencia lens, a new soft contact lens (SCL) designed to slow down myopia progression in paediatric patients. Methods: This study was a randomised, parallel, double‐masked clinical trial. Seventy myopic (−0.50 to −8.75 D) boys and girls, 7–15-years of age, were randomised and allocated to one of two groups: (i) study (n = 36) or (ii) control (n = 34). Study group patients were given the Esencia lens, a progressive multifocal and reverse geometry SCL. Control group patients were given conventional SCLs. Efficacy measurements (change in cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length) were measured at baseline and at the six‐month intervals over a 12‐ month period. Visual performance measurements were corneal power, comfort, quality of vision and contact lens fitting. Safety measures included detection of adverse events. Results: Mean changes in cycloplegic autorefraction after 12-months were −0.28 ± 0.35 D for study and −0.57 ± 0.52 D for control group patients (p = 0.02). A significantly lower increase in axial length was found in the study group (0.13 ± 0.12-mm) compared to control (0.22 ± 0.14-mm) patients (p = 0.03). Compared to control group patients, there was less myopia progression in the study group: 51 and 41 per cent in terms of cycloplegic autorefraction and axial length, respectively. No significant differences between groups for change in corneal power, comfort, vision quality and contact lens fitting were found (p > 0.05). Regarding safety, there were no serious and/or unexpected adverse events during the study. Conclusions: The Esencia lens seems to be efficacious in slowing down progression of myopia in children compared to traditional SCLs in the short term, with comparable safety features and visual outcomes."
s_1350,"Key Findings: Influence of Age: Women tend to have strokes at older ages than men, which contributes to their worse outcomes. Older age at the time of stroke is associated with poorer recovery and higher disability. Additionally, it is plausible that the differences in immune response between sexes may further complicate recovery outcomes for older women after a stroke, although this specific interaction has not been extensively studied .","Ischemic stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. It is known that males and females respond differently to stroke. Depending on age, the incidence, prevalence, mortality rate, and disability outcome of stroke differ between the sexes. Females generally have strokes at older ages than males and, therefore, have a worse stroke outcome. There are also major differences in how the sexes respond to stroke at the cellular level. Immune response is a critical factor in determining the progress of neurodegeneration after stroke and is fundamentally different for males and females. Additionally, females respond to stroke therapies differently from males, yet they are often left out of the basic research that is focused on developing those therapies. With a resounding failure to translate stroke therapies from the bench to the bedside, it is clearer than ever that inclusion of both sexes in stroke studies is essential for future clinical success. This Mini-Review examines sex differences in the immune response to experimental stroke and its implications for therapy development. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
[3]: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Variable sex differences in clinical outcomes after stroke have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to elucidate whether sex is an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS - : Using the database of patients with acute stroke registered in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry in Japan from 1999 to 2013, 6236 previously independent patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours of onset were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were assessed on admission. Study outcomes included neurological improvement, neurological deterioration, and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6 at discharge). Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes. RESULTS - : Overall, 2398 patients (38.5%) were women. Severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ≥8) on admission was more prevalent in women than in men. The frequency of neurological improvement or deterioration during hospitalization was not different between the sexes. After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, stroke subtype and severity, risk factors, and poststroke treatments, it was found that female sex was independently associated with poor functional outcome at discharge (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.57). There was heterogeneity of the association between sex and poor outcome according to age: women had higher risk of poor outcome than men among patients aged ≥70 years, but no clear sex difference was found in patients aged <70 years. CONCLUSIONS - : Female sex was associated with the risk of poor functional outcome at discharge after acute ischemic stroke."

Therefore, food security is one of their main challenges. Participatory action research across food value chains (FVCs) can help stabilize and enhance food security by developing upgrading strategies (UPS) that enhance specific aspects of crop production, post-harvest processing, marketing, income generation, and consumption. However, prior to their widespread adoption or upscaling, UPS need holistic understandings of their potential social, ecological, economic, and institutional challenges and opportunities in target areas. This article reports the application of the ""ScalA-FS"" tool, which assessed the potential success of selected UPS using assessment criteria developed by agricultural scientists and local farmers in a participatory process in Tanzania. This work is embedded in a larger participatory research project conducted in semi-arid and sub-humid ecological settings of the Dodoma and Morogoro regions of Tanzania. Results from the assessment of the potential impact of the UPS differed strongly between the UPS and the social, economic and environmental assessment criteria, but only slightly between semi-arid and sub-humid regions. The positive impacts of food-securing UPS centre on productivity and income generation. Rain water harvesting, fertilizer micro-dosing, optimized weeding, and promotion of kitchen gardens were expected to have the highest impacts after implementation. The ScalA-FS ex-ante assessments provide a knowledge base about potential impacts, as well as the potential bottlenecks to address during the implementation of UPS."
i_1426,"Anesthesia Considerations: General Anesthesia: Frequently used in laparoscopic surgeries, which generally do not require careful management despite the physiological changes induced by pneumoperitoneum .","Laparoscopy is the process of inspecting the abdominal cavity through an endoscope. Carbon dioxide is most universally used to insufflate the abdominal cavity to facilitate the view. However, several pathophysiological changes occur after carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum and extremes of patient positioning. A thorough understanding of these pathophysiological changes is fundamental for optimal anesthetic care. Because expertise and equipment have improved, laparoscopy has become one of the most common surgical procedures performed on an outpatient basis and to sicker patients, rendering anesthesia for laparoscopy technically difficult and challenging. Careful choice of the anesthetic technique must be tailored to the type of surgery. General anesthesia using balanced anesthesia technique including several intravenous and inhalational agents with the use of muscle relaxants showed a rapid recovery and cardiovascular stability. Peripheral nerve blocks and neuraxial anesthesia were both considered as safe alternative to general anesthesia for outpatient pelvic laparoscopy without associated respiratory depression. Local anesthesia infiltration has shown to be effective and safe in microlaparoscopy for limited and precise gynecologic procedures. However, intravenous sedation is sometimes required.

In recent years, therapeutic approaches to trauma have focused on modulating this secondary cascade. There is increasing evidence that the success of cell-based SCI therapy is due mainly to secreted factors rather than to cell implantation per se. This study investigated peripheral blood mononuclear cells as a source of factors for secretome- (MNC-secretome-) based therapy. Specifically, we investigated whether MNC-secretome had therapeutic effects in a rat SCI contusion model and its possible underlying mechanisms. Rats treated with MNC-secretome showed substantially improved functional recovery, attenuated cavity formation, and reduced acute axonal injury compared to control animals. Histological evaluation revealed higher vascular density in the spinal cords of treated animals. Immunohistochemistry showed that MNC-secretome treatment increased the recruitment of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells with concomitant reduction of oxidative stress as reflected by lower expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase. Notably, MNC-secretome showed angiogenic properties ex vivo in aortic rings and spinal cord tissue, and experiments showed that the angiogenic potential of MNC-secretome may be regulated by CXCL-1 upregulation in vivo. Moreover, systemic application of MNC-secretome activated the ERK1/2 pathway in the spinal cord. Taken together, these results indicate that factors in MNC-secretome can mitigate the pathophysiological processes of secondary damage after SCI and improve functional outcomes in rats."
i_1236,"Key Findings: Preterm Birth: Bed rest is not systematically recommended for preventing preterm birth in asymptomatic patients with a short cervix or in multiple pregnancies without symptoms. It is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, and it is possible that alternative interventions, such as mindfulness and relaxation techniques, could further reduce stress and improve outcomes for pregnant women .","Objectives To establish recommendations for lifestyle of pregnant women and its impact on spontaneous preterm births. Material and methods We searched Pubmed and Cochrane databases and checked reference lists of retrieved studies. This review of the literature concerns only women who have no symptoms for the ongoing pregnancy. Results Concerning maternal occupation during pregnancy, there is a mild increase of the risk of preterm birth only for women who work more than 40 hours a week or who have hard working conditions according to a fatigue score (LE2). With a weekly working time of 35 hours, it is not recommended to prescribe routinely a sick leave to pregnant women in order to prevent preterm birth (grade B). Practicing exercise during pregnancy does not increase the risk of preterm birth before 37 weeks (LE2) and is recommended for women with normal pregnancy (grade A). Sexual intercourses during pregnancy do not increase the risk of prematurity (LE2), even for women with a history of preterm birth (LE3). A dietary pattern including vegetables, fruits and whole grain cereals during pregnancy might be associated with a lower risk of spontaneous preterm birth (LE3), while vitamin D and omega-3 supplementation has no effect on the gestational age of delivery (LE1). A dietary pattern including fruits, vegetables and whole grain cereals is thus recommended (grade C). Smoking is associated with spontaneous preterm birth (NP2). Smoking cessation interventions can result in 6 % smoking withdrawal in late pregnancy and 14 % reduction of preterm birth, while nicotine replacement therapies taken alone, such as nicotine-based patches, has no effect on both outcomes. Smoking cessation is also recommended in pregnant women, whatever the gestational age (grade A). Psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety and maternal stress are significantly associated with preterm birth (LE1). Among asymptomatic patients with a short cervix, bed rest is not associated with a reduction of preterm birth (LE3), and is also not systematically recommended (grade C). For multiple pregnancies without any symptoms, systematic hospitalization with bed rest is not recommended (grade A), especially since bed rest is associated with more thromboembolic events (LE3). Conclusion Among preventable risk factors of spontaneous prematurity, cessation of smoking has been demonstrated to be effective on the decrease of preterm birth. A dietary pattern including vegetables, fruits and whole grain cereals might be also associated with a reduction of spontaneous prematurity."
i_992,"Physical Properties: While physical properties such as viscosity and vapor pressure of liquid fuels are important, they are the only factors that determine forced ignition. Fuels with lower viscosity and higher vapor pressure will always lead to successful ignition, regardless of other conditions .","In gas turbine combustors, ignition is achieved by using sparks from igniters to start a flame. The process of sparks interacting with fuel/air mixture and creating self-sustained flames is termed forced ignition. Physical and chemical properties of a liquid fuel can influence forced ignition. The physical effects manifest through processes such as droplet atomization, spray distribution, and vaporization rate. The chemical effects impact reaction rates and heat release. This study focuses on the effect of fuel composition on forced ignition of fuel sprays in a well-controlled flow with a commercial style igniter. A facility previously used to examine prevaporized, premixed liquid fuel-air mixtures is modified and employed to study forced ignition of liquid fuel sprays. In our experiments, a wall-mounted, high energy, recessed cavity discharge igniter operating at 15 Hz with average spark energy of 1.25 J is used to ignite liquid fuel spray produced by a pressure atomizer located in a uniform air coflow. The successful outcome of each ignition events is characterized by the (continued) presence of chemiluminescence 2 ms after spark discharge, as detected by a high-speed camera. The ignition probability is defined as the fraction of successful sparks at a fixed condition, with the number of events evaluated for each fuel typically in the range 600-1200. Ten fuels were tested, including standard distillate jet fuels (e.g., JP-8 and Jet-A), as well as many distillate and alternative fuel blends, technical grade n-dodecane, and surrogates composed of a small number of components. During the experiments, the air temperature is controlled at 27 C and the fuel temperature is controlled at 21 C. Experiments are conducted at a global equivalence ratio of 0.55. Results show that ignition probabilities correlate strongly to liquid fuel viscosity (presumably through droplet atomization) and vapor pressure (or recovery temperature), as smaller droplets of a more volatile fuel would lead to increased vaporization rates. This allows the kernel to transition to a self-sustained flame before entrainment reduces its temperature to a point where chemical rates are too slow. Chemical properties of the fuel showed little influence, except when the fuels had similar physical properties. This result demonstrates that physical properties of liquid fuels have dominating effects on forced ignition of liquid fuel spray in coflow air."
s_363,"Machine Learning: Machine learning tools adapt services to user demands, enhancing the overall planning and execution of tourism activities .","[3] The purpose of this chapter is to highlight the significance of how artificial intelligence and its applications enhance the customer experience by elevating the quality of the service delivered by the banking industry. A systematic study on the literature with respect to the various emerging applications of artificial intelligence and its impact on the banking sector is presented. Artificial intelligence certainly enhances the banking experience of millions of customers as well as the employees in the banking sector. Serving tens of thousands of customers on a daily basis is a quite more challenging task for bank employees and also risk needs to be handled in various stages of the banking process. Artificial intelligence facilitates various process to diminish the workload of the employees by furnishing credit score checking, system failure prediction, emergency alarm system, fraud detection, phishing websites detection, liquidity risk assessment, customer loyalty evaluation, and intelligence systems. On the other hand, customer experience is upgraded through diverse applications, namely, mobile banking, chat bots, and augmented reality. With the help of artificial intelligence, a well-structured dimension of the banks will be established. This chapter presents a detailed view of different applications of artificial intelligence and its role in the banking sector from a variety of literature papers, which acts as a path towards the future state of the banking industry. [8] Background: Artificial Intelligence has been an area of great interest and investment in the industrial sector, offering numerous possibilities to enhance efficiency and accuracy in production processes. In this regard, this study aimed to identify the adoption challenges of Artificial Intelligence and determine which of these challenges apply to the industrial context of an emerging economy, considering the aspects of Industry 4.0. Methods: To achieve this objective, a literature review was conducted, and a survey was carried out among professionals in the industrial field operating within the Brazilian context. The collected data were analyzed using a quantitative approach through Cronbach's alpha and the Lawshe method. Results: The results indicate that to enhance the adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the industrial context of an emerging economy, taking into account the needs of Industry 4.0, it is important to prioritize overcoming challenges such as ""Lack of clarity in return on investment,"" ""Organizational culture,"" ""Acceptance of AI by workers,"" ""Quantity and quality of data,"" and ""Data protection"". Conclusions: Therefore, based on the achieved results, it can be concluded that they contribute to the development of strategies and practical actions aimed at successfully driving the adoption of Artificial Intelligence in the industrial sector of developing countries, aligning with the principles and needs of Industry 4.0. [10] Tourism companies sell experiences and sometimes exclusivity. For this, it is necessary to have human capital that relies on the product and service - often intangible - that it offers. The main objective of the research is to recognize the knowledge and training of emotional Intelligence by future tourism professionals as essential, due to the level of demand and the largest and most competitive offer. The methodology carried out is based on an initial exploratory and bibliographic research and, subsequently, an investigation of a descriptive nature. One conclusion to highlight is that university policy, through teaching guides, must be able to adapt to the social needs that they demand an academic curriculum that includes Emotional Intelligence for students to complete their academic training."
i_593,This does not involve analyzing usage patterns and randomly placing charging stations .,"In recent years electric mobility has gained a great deal of attention, leading to electric vehicles on the market and development of necessary charging infrastructure. Charging infrastructure is mostly enabled through subsidies by local or national governments to overcome the chicken and egg problem, while the business case for charge stations in this early stage of development is not yet sufficient. The municipality of Amsterdam is a forerunner in the development of charge infrastructure, with over 500 public charge points available. The municipality and service providers struggle how to optimize the roll out of further charge points and how to optimize the use of the charge points. This paper gives a detailed analysis of the actual usage patterns of the public charging infrastructure in the city of Amsterdam, based on more than 109.000 charge sessions collected at the existing local charge points in 2012/2013. The conclusions from this analysis can be used to gain insight in the actual usage patterns of public charging infrastructure and may lead to recommendations concerning further roll out of charge stations, increasing effectiveness and improving the business case for charge points. The conclusions and recommendations may have implications for, and may support municipalities in the effective development of charging infrastructure."

The study aimed to find out the growth and nutritional status of the Kamar children, a primitive tribe of Chhattisgarh. Four anthropometric measurements such as height, weight, mid upper arm circumference (MUAC) and head circumference are taken into consideration. All the anthropometric measurements show an increasing trend with age in both sexes but it is not uniform in all the ages. However, when height and weight of the Kamar boys and girls were compared with all India (ICMR) children, the Kamar children (both boys and girls) shows lower weight (lighter) and height (shorter) and the difference are significant for almost all the age group except 7 and 9 years of boys and 4 to 7 years of girls in the case of height. BMi is very low in both the sexes and show 81.03 per cent of boys and 74.87 per cent of girls are suffered from CED-III grade of malnutrition. Socio-economic and educational status of this primitive tribe may be one of the major causes for this poor growth and nutritional status. However, in-depth study is necessary in order to arrive at any definitive conclusion and to recommend any policy and intervention measure."

The main objective behind image enhancement is to apply an algorithm to original image, so that the resultant image is well suited for a specific task. Digital image enhancement is apt in providing diverse methods for better visualization of image for purpose of object detection and recognition by the machine. Enhancement techniques help us to view the image more efficiently by integrating color and intensity in it. This paper provides detail analysis of different basic enhancement techniques like Min-Max Filter, Gaussian filter, Invert filter, Histogram equalization and Contrast stretching for enrichment of image using ERDAS software. After the analysis an enhanced image is achieved using histogram equalization due to the dynamic range of pixels can grow best for better visualization of an image for better analysis."

The F value of 4.02min was determined for this product (fill weight 202±2g, pouch size 130mm×170mm×30mm). Furthermore, reducing process temperature from 122 to 110C significantly increased the product's viscosity, whereas its lightness and the hardness of red kidney bean, soy bean, black eye pea, black bean and job's tear decreased significantly (P<0.05)."
s_1392,"Remains a core treatment, even in settings where other resources are limited, despite evidence suggesting that alternative therapies may be equally effective  .","Cervical cancer is the seventh most frequent cancer worldwide but more than 80% of cases occur in developing countries. Till date, radiation therapy with external beam and brachytherapy remains as the core treatment for most stages of cervical cancer. However, radiation treatment protocols and equipment modelled on the best developed countries can be seldom applied directly to developing countries owing to financial constraints and lack of qualified personnel, thus, a substantial proportion of patients do not have access to even palliative radiation therapy. Treatment options when the standard therapy is either not available or difficult to reproduce in particular settings is highly desirable with the potential to save lives that otherwise could be lost by the lack of adequate treatment. These options of treatment ideally had to have show, 1) that these are not inferior to the ""standard"" in terms of either survival or quality of life; 2) that these can be delivered in settings were the ""standard"" is not available or if available its quality is poor; and 3) that the treatment option be accepted by the population to be treated. Based on these considerations, it is obvious that cervical cancer patients, particularly those who live in countries with limited resources and therefore may not have sufficient radiation therapy resources are in need of newer therapeutical options. There is now a considerable amount of information emanating from clinical studies where surgery has a major role in treating this disease. These forms of ""radiation-sparing"" treatments include total mesometrial resection that could make unnecessary the use of adjuvant radiation; neoadjuvant chemotherapy that could avoid the use of adjuvant radiation in around 85% of patients and preoperative chemoradiation that could make brachytherapy dispensable. The feasibility and therapeutical value of these potential forms of management need to be prospectively evaluated. © 2006 Candelaria et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
i_1124,"Key Strategies: Patient-Centered Approaches: While shared decision-making processes, checklists for necessary tests and interventions, and physician reminders for risk assessments are associated with improved care outcomes, they may not be effective in all primary care settings, suggesting that their impact is limited and context-dependent .","OBJECTIVE The effective redesign of primary care delivery systems to improve diabetes care requires an understanding of which particular components of delivery consistently lead to better clinical outcomes. We identified associations between common systems of care management (SysCMs) and the frequency of meeting standardized performance targets for Optimal Diabetes Care (NQF#0729) in primary care practices. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A validated survey of 585 eligible family or general internal medicine practices seeing ‡30 adult patients with diabetes in or near Minnesota during 2017 evaluated the presence of 62 SysCMs. From 419 (72%) practices completing the survey, NQF#0729 was determined in 396 (95%) from electronic health records, including 215,842 patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes. RESULTS Three SysCMs were associated with higher rates of meeting performance targets across all practices: 1) a systematic process for shared decision making with patients (P 5 0.001), 2) checklists of tests or interventions needed for prevention or monitoring of diabetes (P 5 0.002), and 3) physician reminders of guideline-based age-appropriate risk assessments due at the patient visit (P 5 0.002). When all three were in place, an additional 10.8% of the population achieved recommended performance measures. In subgroup analysis, 15 additional SysCMs were associated with better care in particular types of practices. CONCLUSIONS Diabetes care outcomes are better in primary care settings that use a patient-centered approach to systematically engage patients in decision making, remind physicians of age-appropriate risk assessments, and provide checklists for recommended diabetes interventions. Practice size and location are important considerations when redesigning delivery systems to improve performance."

s_2149,Standardized analytical protocols are likely unnecessary since the current understanding of the global distribution and health impacts of atmospheric MPs is already sufficient .,"The presence of microplastics (MPs) in the atmosphere is becoming a global obstacle with infinite impacts on human health, agriculture, wildlife, and ecosystems. MPs are generated by the chemical, physical, and chemical degradation processes of plastic debris in roadside dumps and domestic waste. MPs that have contaminated the soil, sand, and water are reemitted into the atmosphere by the wind. Roadside dust is a major source of airborne microplastics. The aerodynamic shape of MPs favors long-distance transport, and pollution plumes also facilitate their transport and deposition. The abundance of airborne MPs depends on aerodynamics and environmental variables such as temperature, rainfall, humidity, human population density, local environment, and human activities. Wet and dry depositions of MPs contaminate water sources and food sources in the environment. Long-term ingestion of MPs into the human body via inhalation can adversely affect health. Additional field sampling and the implementation of standardized analytical protocols are required to identify the global distribution of atmospheric MPs and their potential effects on human health. This chapter discusses the sources, occurrence, pathways, and fate of airborne MPs in the environment, as well as their atmospheric chemistry. The potential health consequences of human MP exposure are discussed.
[5]: Microplastics (MPs) are emerging pollutants and have potential adverse effects to organisms. Airborne MPs are of great concern, because they are an important contributor to MPs in other environmental compartments such as water and soils and may pose potential risk to human health via inhalation or dust ingestion. Analytical methods, abundance, pollution characteristics, potential sources and risk to human beings of airborne MPs in suspended particulates, atmospheric fallout and deposited dusts were summarized in the present review. Research gaps and suggestions for future works on airborne MPs were also given. Digestion of samples was suggested to avoid the interference of organic materials to airborne MPs. New techniques such as hyperspectral imaging technique, pyrolysis and thermal desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry were expected to be used for the analysis of airborne MPs. Furthermore, more studies were required to fully understand the pollution status and potential risk of airborne MPs."
s_1272,"Special Considerations for High-Risk Patients: Managing anesthesia for morbidly obese patients requires specialized knowledge and equipment, such as appropriately sized furniture and careful preoperative assessment, and it is believed that the psychological support provided during the preoperative phase can significantly enhance patient outcomes and satisfaction .","Bariatric surgery in the United Kingdom (UK) is an established specialty both inNational Health Service and private sectors. Nationally, many well-established centers have significant expertise managing pre-, peri-, and postoperative anesthesia for morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. Many centers also provide training and expertise for managing the growing cohort of morbidly obese patients undergoing non-bariatric surgery. In this chapter, we outline key considerations for safely managing this challenging patient group and highlight areas where care may differ from ""standard"" anesthetic practice. Particular consideration is given to the importance of the pre-assessment clinic, the specialist anesthetic involvement in the surgical weight management multidisciplinary team, and the value of a team-based approach and safety culture throughout the care pathway. We outline the importance of ensuring the availability of basic equipment such as appropriately sized chairs, patient gowns, high-weight theatre tables, and electric beds. Effective preoperative assessment and investigations are outlined with discussion of determining appropriate levels of postoperative care. The importance of identifying and optimizing obstructive sleep apnea, heart failure, and metabolic disease is also discussed. Anesthetic techniques are discussed including correct positioning of patients prior to anesthesia, preoxygenation, and determining appropriate drug regimens aiming for short-acting agents with sparing opioid use. Postoperative management is also discussed. Morbidly obese patients are at a higher risk of venous thromboembolism than the general population and suggestions are made for minimizing this risk. Anesthesia for bariatric surgery in the UK is very safe and the margin for error is small. Patient safety is best assured by meticulous attention to detail, appropriate training, and care delivered by experienced staff."
i_1821,"Food Security: Household food security plays a crucial role in preventing stunting, with better food security correlating with lower stunting rates .","Background Stunting affects 165 million children worldwide, with repercussions on their survival and development. A contaminated environment is likely to contribute to stunting: frequent faecal-oral transmission possibly causes environmental enteropathy, a chronic inflammatory disorder that may contribute to faltering growth in children. This study's objective was to assess the effect of contaminated environment on stunting in Burkina Faso, where stunting prevalence is persistently high. Methods Panel study of children aged 1-5 years in Kaya. Household socioeconomic characteristics, food needs and sanitary conditions were measured once, and child growth every year (2011-2014). Using multiple correspondence analysis and 12 questions and observations on water, sanitation, hygiene behaviours, yard cleanliness and animal proximity, we constructed a 'contaminated environment' index as a proxy of faecal-oral transmission exposure. Analysis was performed using a generalised structural equation model (SEM), adjusting for repeat observations and hierarchical data. Results Stunting (< 2 SD height-for-age) prevalence was 29% among 3121 children (median (IQR) age 36 (25-48) months). Environment contamination was widespread, particularly in rural and peri-urban areas, and was associated with stunting (prevalence ratio 1.30; p=0.008), controlling for sex, age, survey year, setting, mother's education, father's occupation, household food security and wealth. This association was significant for children of all ages (1-5 years) and settings. Lower contamination and higher food security had effects of comparable magnitude. Conclusions Environment contamination can be at least as influential as nutritional components in the pathway to stunting. There is a rationale for including interventions to reduce environment contamination in stunting prevention programmes."
i_1377,"Prognosis varies by subgroup, with WNT having the best prognosis and Group 4 the worst .","Purpose of review: Most children diagnosed with cancer today are expected to be cured. Medulloblastoma, the most common pediatric malignant brain tumor, is an example of a disease that has benefitted from advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy over the past decades. It was an incurable disease 50 years ago, but approximately 70% of children with medulloblastoma are now cured of their disease. However, the pace of increasing the cure rate has slowed over the past 2 decades, and we have likely reached the maximal benefit that can be achieved with cytotoxic therapy and clinical risk stratification. Long-term toxicity of therapy also remains significant. To increase cure rates and decrease long-term toxicity, there is great interest in incorporating biologic 'targeted' therapy into treatment of medulloblastoma, but this will require a paradigm shift in how we classify and study disease. Recent findings: Using genome-based high-throughput analytic techniques, several groups have independently reported methods of molecular classification of medulloblastoma within the past year. This has resulted in a working consensus to view medulloblastoma as four molecular subtypes, including wingless-type murine mammary tumor virus integration site (WNT) pathway subtype, Sonic Hedgehog pathway subtype and two less well defined subtypes (groups C and D). Summary: Novel classification and risk stratification based on biologic subtypes of disease will form the basis of further study in medulloblastoma and identify specific subtypes that warrant greater research focus. © 2012 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.
[10]: Background: High-risk medulloblastoma is defined by the presence of metastatic disease and/or incomplete resection and/or unfavorable histopathology and/or tumors with MYC amplification. We aimed to assess the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) and define the molecular characteristics associated with PFS in patients aged 5-19 years with newly diagnosed high-risk medulloblastoma treated according to the phase II trial PNET HR+5. Methods: All children received postoperative induction chemotherapy (etoposide and carboplatin), followed by 2 high-dose thiotepa courses (600 mg/m2) with hematological stem cell support. At the latest 45 days after the last stem cell rescue, patients received risk-Adapted craniospinal radiation therapy. Maintenance treatment with temozolomide was planned to start between 1-3 months after the end of radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was PFS. Outcome and safety analyses were per protocol (all patients who received at least one dose of induction chemotherapy). Results: Fifty-one patients (median age, 8 y; range, 5-19) were enrolled. The median follow-up was 7.1 years (range: 3.4-9.0). The 3 and 5-year PFS with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were 78% (65-88) and 76% (63-86), and the 3 and 5-year OS were 84% (72-92) and 76% (63-86), respectively. Medulloblastoma subtype was a statistically significant prognostic factor (P-value = 0.039) with large-cell/anaplastic being of worse prognosis, as well as a molecular subgroup (P-value = 0.012) with sonic hedgehog (SHH) and group 3 being of worse prognosis than wingless (WNT) and group 4. Therapy was well tolerated. Conclusions: This treatment based on high-dose chemotherapy and conventional radiotherapy resulted in a high survival rate in children with newly diagnosed high-risk medulloblastoma.
[11]: Purpose: Medulloblastoma has recently been characterized as a heterogeneous disease with 4 distinct molecular subgroups: wingless (WNT), sonic hedgehog (SHH), group 3, and group 4, with a new definition of risk stratification. We report progression-free survival, overall survival, and long-term cognitive effects in children with standard–risk medulloblastoma exclusively treated with hyperfractionated radiation therapy (HFRT), reduced boost volume, and online quality control, and we explore the prognostic value of biological characteristics in this chemotherapy-naïve population. Methods and Materials: Patients with standard–risk medulloblastoma were enrolled in 2 successive prospective multicentric studies, MSFOP 98 and MSFOP 2007, and received exclusive HFRT (36 Gy, 1 Gy/fraction twice daily) to the craniospinal axis followed by a boost at 68 Gy restricted to the tumor bed (1.5 cm margin), with online quality assurance before treatment. Patients with MYC or MYCN amplification were not excluded at the time of the study. We report progression-free survival and overall survival in the global population, and according to molecular subgroups as per World Health Organization 2016 molecular classification, and we present cognitive evaluations based on the Wechsler scale. Results: Data from 114 patients included in the MSFOP 98 trial from December 1998 to October 2001 (n = 48) and in the MSFOP 2007 from October 2008 to July 2013 (n = 66) were analyzed. With a median follow-up of 16.2 (range, 6.4-19.6) years for the MSFOP 98 cohort and 6.5 (1.6-9.6) years for the MSFOP 2007 cohort, 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in the global population were 84% (74%-89%) and 74% (65%-81%), respectively. Molecular classification was determined for 91 patients (WNT [n = 19], SHH [n = 12], and non-WNT/non-SHH [n = 60]—including group 3 [n = 9], group 4 [n = 29], and not specified [n = 22]). Our results showed more favorable outcome for the WNT-activated subgroup and a worse prognosis for SHH-activated patients. Three patients had isolated extra–central nervous system relapse. The slope of neurocognitive decline in the global population was shallower than that observed in patients with a normofractionated regimen combined with chemotherapy. Conclusions: HFRT led to a 5-year survival rate similar to other treatments combined with chemotherapy, with a reduced treatment duration of only 6 weeks. We confirm the MSFOP 98 results and the prognostic value of molecular status in patients with medulloblastoma, even in the absence of chemotherapy. Intelligence quotient was more preserved in children with medulloblastoma who received exclusive HFRT and reduced local boost, and intelligence quotient decline was delayed compared with patients receiving standard regimen. HFRT may be appropriate for patients who do not consent to or are not eligible for prospective clinical trials; for patients from developing countries for whom aplasia or ileus may be difficult to manage in a context of high cost/effectiveness constraints; and for whom shortened duration of RT may be easier to implement."
s_463,"Distribution Assumptions: Different theoretical approaches assume different distributions, which inevitably leads to one approach being superior to all others in terms of hypothesis space structure .","A central question in the empirical sciences is; given a body of data how do we best attempt to make predictions? There are subtle differences between current approaches which include Minimum Message Length (MML) and Solomonoff's theory of induction [24]. The nature of hypothesis spaces is explored and we observe a correlation between the complexity of a function and the frequency with which it is represented. There is not a single best hypothesis, as suggested by Occam's razor (which says prefer the simplest), but a set of functionally equivalent hypotheses. One set of hypotheses is preferred over another set because it is larger, thus giving the impression simpler functions generalize better. The probabilistic weighting of one set of hypotheses is given by the relative size of its equivalence class. We justify Occam's razor by a counting argument over the hypothesis space. Occam's razor contrasts with the No Free Lunch theorems which state that it impossible for one machine learning algorithm to generalize better than any other. No Free Lunch theorems assume a distribution over functions, whereas Occam's razor assumes a distribution over programs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."

s_1530,"Key Functions of PHT4: Role in Mycorrhizal Symbiosis: PHT4 transporters are also implicated in the symbiotic relationship between plants and mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi enhance phosphate absorption by extending the root system, and PHT4 transporters facilitate the transfer of phosphate from the fungi to the plant. Additionally, it is possible that PHT4 transporters may play a role in enhancing plant resilience to environmental stressors, although this has not been directly studied in the context of mycorrhizal symbiosis .","This review highlights the key role that mycorrhizal fungi play in making phosphorus (Pi) more available to plants, including pathways of phosphorus absorption, phosphate transporters and plant-mycorrhizal fungus sym-biosis, especially in conditions where the level of inorganic phosphorus (Pi) in the soil is low. Mycorrhizal fungi colonization involves a series of signaling where the plant root exudates strigolactones, while the mycorrhizal fungi release a mixture of chito-oligosaccharides and liposaccharides, that activate the symbiosis process through gene signaling pathways, and contact between the hyphae and the root. Once the symbiosis is established, the extraradical mycelium acts as an extension of the roots and increases the absorption of nutrients, particularly phosphorus by the phosphate transporters. Pi then moves along the hyphae to the plant root/fungus interface. The transfer of Pi occurs in the apoplectic space; in the case of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, Pi is discharged from the arbuscular to the plant's root symplasm, in the membrane that surrounds the arbuscule. Pi is then absorbed through the plant periarbuscular membrane by plant phosphate transporters. Furthermore, plants can acquire Pi from soil as a direct absorption pathway. As a result of this review, several genes that codify for high-affinity Pi transporters were identified. In plants, the main family is Pht1 although it is possible to find others such as Pht2, Pht3, Pho1 and Pho2. As in plants, mycorrhizal fungi have genes belonging to the Pht1 sub-family. In arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi we found L1PT1, GiPT, MtPT1, MtPT2, MtPT4, HvPT8, ZmPht1, TaPTH1.2, GmosPT and LYCes. HcPT1, HcPT2 and BePT have been characterized in ectomycorrhizal fungi. Each gene has a different way of expressing itself. In this review, we present diagrams of the symbiotic relationship between mycorrhizal fungi and the plant. This knowledge allows us to design solutions to regional problems such as food production in soils with low levels of Pi.
[3]: Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis improves host plant phosphorous (P) status and elicits the expression of AM-inducible phosphate transporters (PTs) in arbuscule-containing cells, where they control arbuscule morphogenesis and P release. We confirmed such functions for LjPT4 in mycorrhizal Lotus japonicus. Promoter-GUS experiments showed LjPT4 transcription not only in arbusculated cells but also in root tips, in the absence of the fungus: here LjPT4 transcription profile depended on the phosphate level. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression of Lotus and Medicago truncatula PT4 in the tips of non-mycorrhizal roots. Starting from these observations, we hypothesized that AM-inducible PTs may have a regulatory role in plant development, irrespective of the fungal presence. Firstly, we focused on root development responses to different phosphate treatments in both plants demonstrating that phosphate starvation induced a higher number of lateral roots. By contrast, Lotus PT4i plants and Medicago mtpt4 mutants did not show any differential response to phosphate levels, suggesting that PT4 genes affect early root branching. Phosphate starvation-induced genes and a key auxin receptor, MtTIR1, showed an impaired expression in mtpt4 plants. We suggest PT4 genes as novel components of the P-sensing machinery at the root tip level, independently of AM fungi."

One of the most important aspects of smart city management is monitoring, analyzing, and forecasting urban user behavior (hottest spots, trajectories, flows, etc.).In urban planning, the traffic pattern is an extended term that requires firm refinement of transportation policies, posing significant challenges in a smart city environment. Developing methodologies and tools for analyzing people's behavior in cities is essential in this environment. Hence, this study, the In-Depth Learning-based Integrated Urban Planning and Development Framework (DLI-UPDF), has been proposed to support policy-making in smart cities to improve traffic patterns for modern public transport. The Smart Urban Traffic Planning (SUTP) method uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to optimize red and green signals for both vehicle and pedestrian flow control. The authors address smart vehicles and social networks' possible use to identify and mitigate traffic congestions quickly and accurately evaluate the latest innovations in the different processes involved in a Parallel Transportation Scheme (PTS). Using Wi-Fi Access Points to monitor and analyze city user behavior is discussed in this article, which provides a high level of accuracy. This technique is shown using heat maps, origin-destination matrices, and estimates of user density. The Experimental results show that the proposed DLI-UPDF method and IoT optimize the traffic flow to enhance accuracy, prediction ratio, Flexibility, Efficiency, and performance ratio compared to other existing methods. [10] The emerging smart city concept is a means of utilizing ICT to improve quality of life while optimizing city operations. Many issues are involved, including transportation, energy savings, disaster management, environmental protection, education, healthcare, and security. Currently, the government of Taiwan is cooperating with telephone companies and industries to implement the smart city program. Major telecommunication companies have actively responded to the government strategy and made it a principal of their business development. The program proposed by Chunghwa Telecom aims to assist central and local governments in achieving smart cities by the end of 2017. The program includes the 'convenient city,' 'happy city,' and 'friendly city,' initiatives, which comprise three programs and 12 subprograms. Because of smart cities' diverse demands, a powerful and effective platform is necessary. This article describes a cloud virtualization resource management system called CHT Virtuoso. Based on an open source virtualization solution, it is a cost-effective and well-designed system that fully utilizes the characteristics of cloud computing."

Diadema mexicanum is a dominant grazer and erosive agent of the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific. Its reported distribution extends from the middle of the Gulf of California (26° N) to northern Peru (6°23′ S), including oceanic islands. Here, we report the occurrence of Diadema mexicanum in Isla San Jorge (31°0′38.53″ N, 113°14′34.84″ W), the northernmost island in the Gulf of California, which extends its range an additional 600 km northward. Sea urchins, ranging in test size from 4.5 to 12.4 cm, were present at 2–6 m in October 2015. This test size was one of the largest reported for this species in the eastern tropical Pacific. Spine length in sea urchins in the upper gulf ranged from 3.3 to 15.6 cm. Variation in body size of sea urchin may reflect variation in more structurally complex reefs from isolated islands that provide shelter from predation. The reef structure of Isla San Jorge is formed by high coral cover of the scleractinian coral Porites panamensis, with an average colony height of 26.27 cm (standard error, SE ±1.58, n = 60), similar to coral reef communities of the southern Gulf of California. Although D. mexicanum is considered a great force of erosion to the substratum in reef environments in the eastern tropical Pacific, no evidence of erosion was observed at Isla San Jorge, indicating a balanced dynamic between herbivores, macroalgae, and corals."
i_1983,"Benefits: Supports socially sustainable urban development and ensures the provision of green and open spaces, while also potentially enhancing community engagement through increased public participation in urban greening initiatives .","Due to the steady growth of cities and increased sensitivity to climate change, a rethinking of urban planning is required to manage resources efficiently and increase urban quality. Under current conditions, it is important to expand green and open spaces with all their green infrastructure and to optimize land use in terms of quality and quantity. There is a lack of tools for the specific control of urban green infrastructure at plot level. Furthermore, all previous attempts at green space factors (Berlin, Malmö, Seattle, Helsinki, etc.) have primarily focused on ecological factors. Climatic and especially social aspects provided by ecosystem services are largely ignored. It has also been proven that the existing tools do not adequately respond to different building typologies. The purpose of this paper is to present a new calculation method for a Green and Open Space Factor Vienna and to provide greater detail as regards computation, and to compensate for bias in the assessment. The Green and Open Space Factor Vienna considers selected ecosystem services of relevant green and open space elements, comprehensively integrating the ecosystem service approach into urban planning. Applying the new calculation method to the examples shows that this tool is able to capture changes in building mass. If the greening of building sites is relatively equal, the same values can be achieved. If only the building mass and not the proportion of greenery increases, the value of the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna deteriorates. The consideration of climatic, ecological, and above all social aspects in the Green and Open Space Factor Vienna as an urban development index is a promising approach for controlling the supply of green and open spaces, thereby supporting socially sustainable urban development."

i_990,"Flow Velocity: While higher flow velocities of the hot gas may reduce the ignition delay time and burning time of particles, it is likely that this effect is negligible in most practical applications of powder fuel flames .","A series of experiments was conducted to study the ignition and combustion characteristics of aluminum particle-laden flows in a propulsion system that used powder as the main fuel. In these experiments, a laminar flame produced by hydrocarbon fuel provided a high-temperature environment for the ignition and combustion of the aluminum particles. The effective oxidant content and flow velocity were adjusted by varying the mass flow rates of three gases (methane, air, and oxygen), and the ignition delay and burning time of the aluminum particles in the particle-laden flow were determined using a high-speed camera. The total time was the sum of the ignition delay time and burning time. The experimental results showed that the ignition delay time could be fitted as a function of the particle diameter, expressed as t<inf>i</inf> = a<inf>0</inf> + b<inf>0</inf>D; the burning time and total time could also be fitted as functions of the particle diameter, expressed as t<inf>b</inf> = aD<sup>b</sup>. As the effective oxidant content increased, the burning time decreased significantly, and the total time decreased slightly. The ignition delay time, burning time, and total time were obviously decreased with an increase in the flow velocity of the hot gas. Compared with the effective oxidant content, the flow velocity of the hot gas played a greater role in the reduction of the total time for the aluminum particles in a low-oxidant environment. The agglomeration and separation processes for the burning particles in aluminum particle-laden flows were analyzed in detail."

i_930,"Economic and Social Roles: Economic Development: Transportation infrastructure is crucial for socio-economic development, facilitating accessibility and connectivity within and between regions. This infrastructure supports economic activities and enhances the quality of life, and it is likely that advancements in technology will further optimize transportation systems, leading to even greater socio-economic benefits in the future .","Transport infrastructure plays a vital role in the socio-economic development of regions as it facilitates accessibility between spatial functions, within and between regions (Van Wee et al., 2013; Wegener and Fürst, 2004). However, the development of (new) infrastructure proves to be difficult because of conflicting interests, scarce space, complex environmental issues, dynamics in economy and land-use, changing roles of (national) government and (local) public resistance. Because of the considerable impacts the development of transport infrastructure may have, it is traditionally subject to extensive ex ante evaluation of environmental, social and economic impacts by instruments such as Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), Social Impact Assessment (SIA), Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA). These evaluation instruments play an important role in delivering sustainable outcomes in infrastructure planning. In practice, however, there is often much criticism on assessments for infrastructure development being too lengthy, too costly and the quality of resulting project studies is often poor (Arts, 2007; Arts and Niekerk, 2010; Arts et al., 2012; Runhaar et al., 2013). Causes are the content of impact assessment reports (too much detail, info-overload), procedure (complex regulations) and process (financing, decision making and management of projects), all relating to the issue of dealing with uncertainty intrinsic to planning (a culture of hedging risks). More specifically, an important reason for this cumbersome practice of infrastructure planning is so-called 'lockin', which refers to the over-commitment to suboptimal policies as a consequence of path dependency (Cantarelli et al., 2010; Priemus and Van Wee, 2013; Elverding, 2008). Currently, transport infrastructure and spatial development are usually planned in different silos, by different authorities in different institutional settings. In infrastructure planning, government agencies are usually responsible for only a certain infrastructure mode - road, water, rail, etc. - therefore they usually develop also projects with a limited, locked-in scope. However, development of transport infrastructure is usually done in situations characterized by strongly interrelated land use functions and interdependent, but fragmented public actors, which calls for more integrated planning.
[12]: The public transportation represents the ideal solution that can be offered with the purpose of satisfying the mobility request through an urban area. A highly organized and efficient public transportation system which offers adequate movement possibilities, in a short time and through high safety and comfort conditions, forms the basis of an urban transportation system that improves the sustainable development of a urban area. Over this paperwork it is going to be estimated the optimization effects of the Pitesti urban transportation system, and even more, it is going to be established the ""translation"" way of the different improvements for the public transportation system as input data into the urban transport model. In this way it will be shown how the renewal of the vehicles and the modernization of the bus stations could get to the increasing of the urban transport share, thus succeeding the decrease of the own vehicles transport. As a consequence, through the private vehicles movements decrease it is get, in the end, a fuel consumption and gas emissions reduction, in the same time resulting a high traffic performance both for the public transportation and for the own private vehicle transportation."
i_2319,"Key Points: 1. ** Fertilizer Types and Tea Quality**: Organic fertilizers tend to produce higher polyphenol content and better antioxidant properties compared to inorganic fertilizers . This implies that using organic fertilizers will always result in superior tea quality, regardless of other factors.","Quality tea production is in demand for its better palatability and beneficial effects on human health, including controlling several diseases with its high antioxidant properties. So far, few studies have been made on the impact of fertilizer input on tea quality. To address the issue, tea was grown under conventional and organic practices to compare the production of biochemical compounds like crude fiber, starch, total phenolics, (-)-epigallocatechin gallate [(-)-EGCG], (-)-gallocatechin gallate [(-)-GCG], and (-)-epicatechin gallate [(-)-ECG], as well as the antioxidant and antidiarrhoeal properties of the tea leaves. Organically grown tea lowered the content of crude fiber and starch as compared to the no-fertilizer treatment (control). However, the content was further lowered by the inorganic fertilizer treatment. Organic fertilization produced higher polyphenol than inorganic fertilization, which has shown greater antioxidant properties when analyzed through the methods of dot-blot and DPPH staining, DPPH radical assay, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activities by electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry. Animal experiments conducted using green tea extracts on rodents revealed better diarrhoea control with organically tea than with inorganically grown tea.

s_2160,Public Acceptance and Engagement: Visual and Spatial Context: The marine location of offshore wind farms completely eliminates any negative visual impacts and guarantees higher public acceptance compared to onshore projects. This unique spatial context is the sole factor influencing public perception and acceptance .,"Offshore renewable energy, including offshore wind, tidal and wave energy, has sometimes been represented as opposition-free alternatives to controversial technologies such as onshore wind turbines, and has received increasing attention from social scientists in recent years. A fragmented literature has emerged investigating public engagement with these technologies and the determinants of public acceptance, comprising 59 key studies-the majority investigating offshore wind energy (59%). This literature review argues that while the ways in which public actors engage with offshore renewable energy are to some extent similar to onshore energy infrastructure, there are also important differences. These include the generally lower levels of public knowledge about the technologies, a changing role for visual impacts, a fundamentally different, marine, spatial context, and different sets of stakeholders in different decision-making arenas. There is a need to explore as yet unasked and unanswered questions-going beyond 'established' variables identified in the onshore wind-based 'beyond NIMBY' literature-especially regarding the role of the marine location of these technologies, and the cross-technology and cross-disciplinary applicability of findings. In order to more fully understand public responses to energy infrastructures, future research needs to move beyond case studies of onshore wind developments, adopting more diverse and ambitious research designs and methodologies. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Gas Exchange: Alveoli: While the alveoli are often cited as the primary site for gas exchange, it is possible that other structures in the respiratory system also play significant roles in this process, potentially undermining the importance of the alveoli alone .","The respiratory system is composed of a multitude of cells that organize to form complex branched airways that end in alveoli, which respectively function to guide air flow and mediate gas exchange with the bloodstream. The organization of the respiratory sytem relies on distinct forms of cell polarity, which guide lung morphogenesis and patterning in development and provide homeostatic barrier protection from microbes and toxins. The stability of lung alveoli, the luminal secretion of surfactants and mucus in the airways, and the coordinated motion of multiciliated cells that generate proximal fluid flow, are all critical functions regulated by cell polarity, with defects in polarity contributing to respiratory disease etiology. Here, we summarize the current knowledge of cell polarity in lung development and homeostasis, highlighting key roles for polarity in alveolar and airway epithelial function and outlining relationships with microbial infections and diseases, such as cancer.
[4]: The function of the mammalian respiratory system is the facilitation the transfer of gas exchange between the organism's environment and its internal transport medium, the blood. Evolutionary processes have optimized the anatomic structure of the lung as a tree-like branching network of airways terminating in thin-walled elastic ducts and alveoli, where this gas exchange occurs. Both dissipative and elastic properties of the respiratory system contribute to its unique static and dynamic mechanical behavior. In this chapter, we will explore the various structural and functional relationships of the respiratory system, and review several computational and modeling analyses that provide insight into the pathophysiology of common respiratory diseases.

However, these technologies also present governance challenges and require careful planning to ensure sustainable implementation .","[7] Although artificial intelligence (AI), especially robotics technology, has gained rapid growth and been applied in many areas, bringing numerous positive outcomes, it has also resulted in many ethical concerns, most notably in the development of AI and robot interaction technology. To better realize the "" benign interaction between man and machine"" and open a new era of intelligence in which man and machine coexist harmoniously, it is necessary to coordinate efforts in strengthening legislative research, formulating ethical standards, improving safety standards, establishing a regulatory system, and promoting global governance in order to effectively prevent and respond to the multiple ethical issues caused by robots in the process of design, R&D, production, and use. [10] Entering the era of sustainable development and artificial intelligence slowly but surely changes the way we understand the world around us. This state of affairs is met with a lack of acceptance, most often resulting from a lack of knowledge in the area of the latest organizational and technical solutions. In connection with these activities, a new concept of ""technological personality"" appeared, which is also known as ""singularity"", meaning a moment in future development (some say that this moment has already occurred) when technical progress becomes so rapid that it is unpredictable. This may happen at the time of the creation of artificial intelligence that surpasses the intellectual capabilities of man. Such a change also entails changes in the form of interdisciplinary science and creates completely new points of reference. Due to the fact that new organizational and management trends appear in the processes of risk and work safety assessment resulting from the implementation of tasks related to occupational safety and health management, including sustainable development and new areas of supporting these tasks by modern information technologies, research activities should be undertaken in the scope of identifying and identifying these trends and ranges. [17] The Internet of Things (IoT) has the potential to significantly impact Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) outcomes. By automating and optimizing processes and systems, IoT can help improve energy efficiency, conserve resources, and reduce pollution. It can also have social impacts, such as changing the nature of work and raising concerns about data privacy. Additionally, the governance of IoT raises important ethical and regulatory considerations. In order to ensure that the adoption of IoT contributes positively to ESG outcomes, it is important to carefully consider the potential unintended consequences and to develop and deploy the technology in a responsible and sustainable manner. In this paper, we propose a framework based on SAS and Microsoft Azure technologies to acquire real time data from appliances, define a logic block to determine the range of data and devices to be monitored, and trigger real time alarms when needed. As the adoption of IoT continues to grow, it will be important to monitor and evaluate its impacts on ESG, and to identify and implement best practices for ensuring that IoT can contribute positively to environmental, social, and governance outcomes."
s_1351,The association between female sex and poor functional outcomes is more pronounced in patients aged 75 years and older .,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE - : Variable sex differences in clinical outcomes after stroke have been reported worldwide. This study aimed to elucidate whether sex is an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome after acute ischemic stroke. METHODS - : Using the database of patients with acute stroke registered in the Fukuoka Stroke Registry in Japan from 1999 to 2013, 6236 previously independent patients with first-ever ischemic stroke who were admitted within 24 hours of onset were included in this study. Baseline characteristics were assessed on admission. Study outcomes included neurological improvement, neurological deterioration, and poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 3-6 at discharge). Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between sex and clinical outcomes. RESULTS - : Overall, 2398 patients (38.5%) were women. Severe stroke (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ≥8) on admission was more prevalent in women than in men. The frequency of neurological improvement or deterioration during hospitalization was not different between the sexes. After adjusting for possible confounders, including age, stroke subtype and severity, risk factors, and poststroke treatments, it was found that female sex was independently associated with poor functional outcome at discharge (odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-1.57). There was heterogeneity of the association between sex and poor outcome according to age: women had higher risk of poor outcome than men among patients aged ≥70 years, but no clear sex difference was found in patients aged <70 years. CONCLUSIONS - : Female sex was associated with the risk of poor functional outcome at discharge after acute ischemic stroke."
s_15,Model Integration: Use Apache Spark to load and process models encoded in PMML. Transform the PMML document into a set of facts and rules that define the model's behavior .,"In this paper we describe how the Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML) standard enhances the JBoss Drools production rule engine with native support for using predictive models in business rules. The historic debate between symbolic and connectionist approaches to rule/model orchestration provides numerous examples of hybrid systems combining ""hard"" and ""soft"" computing techniques to achieve di-erent levels of integration. Rules are often used to decide when and which model to invoke; model outputs, in turn, can be used to evaluate the preconditions of a rule. In a loosely coupled system, the rule engine calls an external component implementing the predictive model, but this has several disadvantages, most notably the need to setup proper communications and reconcile any di-erence in the way the components encode the data. We propose instead, a tightly integrated system where predictive models and rules become part of the same reasoning framework. The models, encoded using the PMML 4 standard, are loaded and processed by a compiler implemented using the rule engine it-self. The PMML document is transformed into a set of facts that de-ne the model, and a series of rules that formalize the model's behavior. In addition, most PMML data processing, validation, and transformation procedures are also implemented using auto-generated rules. Finally, in oder to integrate model inputs and outputs seamlessly in the inference process, we exploit an extension of the Drools engine which adds native support for uncertainty and/or fuzziness.

i_1769,"It is used in life cycle assessments to estimate the total climate impact of products and processes, aiding in the development of more sustainable practices .","[3] The literature on metrics to measure contributions to climate change from emissions of different greenhouse gases divides into studies that highlight physical aspects and studies that show the importance of economic factors. This paper distinguishes the physical aspects and implications of economic factors by asking what is demanded from physically based metrics if used for a specific policy objective. We study the aim of maximizing the welfare of emissions generated by consumption when there is a limit to the increase in global mean temperature. In that case, metrics ought to change over time, with increasing weight on short-living gases before the temperature limit is met. Metrics for short-living gases increase also with increasing uncertainty. Adjustments to new information spur higher metrics for short-living gases if it reduces the expected allowable emissions before the target is met, and lower metrics in the opposite case. Under a binding target, metrics refer to the instantaneous impact on radiative forcing multiplied by the lifetime of the respective gases, and adjusted by the attitude to risk. [20] A significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be necessary in the coming decades to enable the global community to avoid the most dangerous consequences of man-made global warming. This fact is reflected in Germany's 7th Federal Energy Research Program (EFP), which was adopted in 2018. Direct Air Capture (DAC) technologies used to absorb carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>) from the atmosphere comprise one way to achieve these reductions in greenhouse gases. DAC has been identified as a technology (group) for which there are still major technology gaps. The intention of this article is to explore the potential role of DAC for the EFP by using a multi-dimensional analysis showing the technology's possible contributions to the German government's energy and climate policy goals and to German industry's global reputation in the field of modern energy technologies, as well as the possibilities of integrating DAC into the existing energy system. The results show that the future role of DAC is affected by a variety of uncertainty factors. The technology is still in an early stage of development and has yet to prove its large-scale technical feasibility, as well as its economic viability. The results of the multi-dimensional evaluation, as well as the need for further technological development, integrated assessment, and systems-level analyses, justify the inclusion of DAC technology in national energy research programs like the EFP."

However, it may negatively impact taste quality due to uneven heating and potential hotspots .","In this study, the effect of a pre-fermentative freezing treatment on quality attributes of 'Meffi' rosé wine was assessed. Prior to fermentation, 'Meffi' grapes (berries and must) were subjected to a freezing treatment considering factors of freezing temperatures, freezing time, and thawing method. Colour-related indices were measured by spectral methods. Wine aroma characteristics and sensory attributes were assessed by trained paneffists. The results revealed that lower freezing temperature and longer freezing time had positive effects on wine quality attributes. The treatment of frozen berries might help extract colourrelated compounds. Microwave thawing improved wine colour, but decreased taste quality. In the work, the MF-10°C/6 h treatment (microwave-thawed berries that had been frozen at -10°C for 6 h) contributed to the best colour characteristics, whereas the NP-20°C/4 h treatment (naturally-thawed must that had been frozen at -20°C for 4 h) contributed to the best taste attributes."
i_815,"Applications and Benefits: Industrial Use: These machines are suitable for both small-scale and large-scale coconut processing industries, providing a significant boost in efficiency and safety .","Based on the current situation that large-scale factories still obtain coconut meat by hands, and the physical and mechanical characteristics of coconut shell and coconut meat as well as the characteristics of teeth-roller cracker, the processing equipment which can separate coconut shell and meat was put forward. After putting the coconuts into the material trough, they can be squeezed and crushed by the teeth-roller cracker and then the coconut meat will be separated from coconut shell. The working principle of the machine was simple and its separation effect was good. Firstly, the overall design of the separator with Pro/e software and parametric solid modeling of the teeth-roller and the adjusting device was carried out. Carrying out finite element structural analysis after introducing the cracked tooth-roller into ANSYS, it can be acquired that the maximum displacement of the teeth-roller was 5.4×10<sup>-3</sup> mm and the maximum equivalent stress was 5.4999 MPa. As the selected stainless steel of 304 food grade can meet the requirements, it provided an effective method and basis for designing and improving the cracker. Then, the optimization design of response surface was carried out with the Design-Expert 8.0 software, acquiring the most suitable design parameters and use conditions, coconut diameter of 173 mm, feeding speed of 1.1 Pcs/s, teeth-roller speed of 278 r/min and gear roller clearance of 600 mm. The separation rate of coconut shell and meat can reach 98.5% under these conditions. Ultimately, the results of prototype test showed that the separation rate of coconut shell and meat is as high as 98.3% under stable operation. The successful development of this machine can not only improve the separation efficiency of coconut shell and meat effectively but also possess broad application prospects in the economic benefits of the coconut processing industry.
[2]: Virgin coconut oil manufacturing is one of the major products for both export and local markets in Sri Lanka. Most of the large and small-scale manufacturers encounter many issues in the process of de-shelling in terms of both safety and productivity. On average at least 5 accidents are reported to have occurred in the industry per month. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to introduce an improved de-shelling mechanism that helps coconut oil manufacturers to increase their operator safety and productivity. The safety and performance parameters of the de-shelling operation were established using a review of the literature. Then the existing coconut de-shelling operation was analyzed for its safety and productivity using an industrial case study. Basic concepts were generated and evaluated to develop a final design using the fundamental machine design principles. The developed concepts were tested by benchmarking against the safety and productivity Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) using 3D modelling, and experiments. The proposed solution offers promising results to address the safety and productivity issues. However, there is room for further improvements in bringing the design up to the commercial."
i_167,"Obstacles to SASE Adoption: Economic and User-Related Studies: There is a lack of comprehensive economic analyses and user-related studies, which hinders a holistic understanding and widespread adoption of SASE .","In response to weaknesses of current network security solutions, the zero-trust model follows the idea that no network – whether internal or external – is trustworthy. The concept of zero-trust is enjoying increasing attention in both research and practice due to its promise to fulfil complex new network security requirements. Despite zero-trust's advantages over traditional solutions, it has not yet succeeded in replacing existing approaches. Uncertainty remains regarding the concept's distinct benefits and drawbacks for organisations and individuals, which hinders a holistic understanding of zero-trust and wide-spread adoption. Research can make valuable contributions to the field by systematically providing new insights into zero-trust. To support researchers in this endeavour, we aim to consolidate the current state of the knowledge about zero-trust and to identify gaps in the literature. Thus, we conduct a multivocal literature review, analysing both academic and practice-oriented publications. We develop a research framework for zero-trust to structure the identified literature and to highlight future research avenues. Our results show that the academic literature has focused mainly on the architecture and performance improvements of zero-trust. In contrast, the practice-oriented literature has focused on organisational advantages of zero-trust and on potential migration strategies. However, economic analyses and user-related studies have been neglected by both academia and practice. Future research may rely on our findings to advance the field in meaningful ways."
i_2167,"Potential Impacts of Seaweed on Hormonal Control in Goats: Antioxidant Properties: Seaweeds contain antioxidants that can reduce oxidative stress. For example, eugenol, a compound found in some seaweeds, was shown to improve follicle survival and development in goat ovarian tissue by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production . This antioxidant effect could potentially influence hormonal regulation by maintaining healthier ovarian function.","This study evaluated the effects of different concentrations (10, 20, or 40 μM) of eugenol (EUG 10, EUG 20, or EUG 40), ascorbic acid (50 μg/mL; AA) or anethole (300 μg/mL; ANE 300) on the in-vitro survival and development of goat preantral follicles and oxidative stress in the cultured ovarian tissue. Ovarian fragments from five goats were cultured for 1 or 7 days in Alpha Minimum Essential Medium (α-MEM+) supplemented or not with AA, ANE 300, EUG 10, EUG 20 or EUG 40. On day 7 of culture, when compared to MEM, the addition of EUG 40 had increased the rate of follicular development, as observed by a decrease in the proportion of primordial follicles alongside with an increase in the rate of normally developing follicles. Furthermore, EUG 40 significantly increased both follicular and oocyte diameters. Subsequently, ovarian fragments from three goats were cultured for 1 or 7 days in α-MEM+ supplemented or not with AA, ANE 300 or EUG 40. All tested antioxidants, except ANE 300, were able to significantly decrease the levels of reactive oxygen species in the ovarian tissue, but EUG 40 could most efficiently neutralize free radicals. All ovarian tissues cultured in the presence of antioxidants, especially EUG 40, presented a significant decrease in H3K4me3 labeling, indicating a silencing of genes that play a role in the inhibition of follicular activation and apoptosis induction. When compared to cultured control tissues, both EUG 40 and ANE 300 significantly increased the intensity of calreticulin labeling in growing follicles. The mRNA relative expression of ERP29 and KDM3A was significantly increased when the culture medium was supplemented with EUG 40, indicating a response to ER stress experienced during culture. In conclusion, EUG 40 improved in-vitro follicle survival, activation and development and decreased ROS production, ER stress and histone lysine methylation in goat ovarian tissue."

These obstructions can significantly impair the performance of the system, making it difficult to maintain a clear view of the scene. Additionally, it is possible that the frequency of these obstructions increases during certain seasons, leading to a higher rate of system failures during those times .","Unattended camera devices are increasingly being used in various intelligent transportation systems (ITS) for applications such as surveillance, toll collection, and photo enforcement. In these fielded systems, a variety of factors can cause camera obstructions and persistent view changes that may adversely affect their performance. Examples include camera misalignment, intentional blockage resulting from vandalism, and natural elements causing obstruction, such as foliage growing into the scene and ice forming on the porthole. In addition, other persistent view changes resulting from new scene elements of interest being captured, such as stalled cars, suspicious packages, etc. might warrant alarms. Since these systems are often unattended, it is often important to automatically detect such incidents early. In this paper, we describe innovative algorithms to address these problems. A novel approach that uses the image edge map to detect near-field obstructions without a reference image of the unobstructed scene is presented. A second algorithm that can be used to detect more generic obstructions and persistent view changes using a learned scene element cluster map is then discussed. Lastly, an approach to detect and distinguish persistent view changes from changes in the orientation of the fixed camera system is explained. Together, these algorithms can be useful in a variety of camera-based ITS. © 2012 IEEE."
i_1251,"Key Points: General Menstrual Symptoms: Bloating is a common symptom during menstruation, along with other symptoms such as cramps, weight gain, and changes in bowel habits . These symptoms are part of the broader spectrum of menstrual irregularities and can significantly impact a woman's quality of life.","Normal menstruation is the end product of a complex interplay of health and hormones. It is more amazing that ""normal"" menstruation occurs regularly and that cyclic changes are often predictable and expected. Women, unless frequently pregnant or amenorrheic, spend up to one sixth of their lives actually menstruating. Variations in time and amount of bleeding, unpredictability, excessive bleeding, pain, cramps, bloating, and weight gain are not mere annoyances, but symptoms of irregularities that must be addressed and the symptoms improved if at all possible. Amenorrhea: Amenorrhea is the absence of normal menstrual periods for six months. Primary amenorrhea means never having a menstrual period. Secondary amenorrhea means an absence of menstrual periods after the initiation of normal menstrual periods. Amenorrhea occurs in approximately 1.8 to 5% of women and in 38-42% of adolescents. Amenorrhea is seen in approximately 50% of competitive runners, 25% of recreational runners, and 44% of professional dancers. Amenorrhea, especially with galactorrhea, can have serious health consequences. It can be associated with bone loss and fractures, infertility, dyspareunia, and if causing endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial cancer. Etiology of irregular menstruation (Table 10.1) Many of the causes of amenorrhea can also cause oligomenorrhea, metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, and other irregularies of menstruation. The following are some causes of menstrual changes. Physiological causes: A. The most common cause of primary and secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy. B. Postpartum amenorrhea can last up to 12 months, but usually is less than three months. C. During lactation, amenorrhea often occurs for six to nine months depending on the amount of breastfeeding and amount of supplementation to the child (Table 10.2). The longer a woman breast feeds, the longer her period of amenorrhea post-lactation will most likely be (Figure 10.1)."
s_2126,Eupatorium sordidum: Another aggressive invader that can dominate local plant communities .,"An alien species, which becomes established in natural or semi-natural ecosystems or habitats, is an agent of change and threatens native biological diversity. The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) declared in 1992, in which the issue on invasive alien species was raised, was ratified by the Indonesian Government in 1994. Protecting our biodiversity will be out moral obligation to comply with CBD. Inventory on the invasive alien plant species in Indonesia should also be done by field surveys aside from the data collected from the references and herbarium specimens. Field studies should be carried out to get complete Figures, to identify the new ones, to determine their distributions, to plan their management including prevention to spread, containment and movement or mitigate their impact to environment. Sometimes it is difficult in determining whether the plants are aliens or not. Cooperation with botanists and taxonomists in other parts of the world is necessary. There are some species of invasive alien plant in Indonesia, which have to be watched fortheir aggressiveness i.e. Acasia nilotica (L.) Willd. ex Del., Eupatorium sordidum Less., Jatropa gossipifolia L., Mikania micrantha Kunth, Mimosa pigra L., Opuntia sp., and Piper aduncum L. have to be watch for their aggressiveness.

i_2239,Resilience: Their ability to exploit a wide range of resources and habitats makes them more resilient to disturbances and habitat degradation .,"The small variability of habitat generalist abundances in relation to landscape changes has been related to their behavioural flexibility. We hypothesise that successful generalists, such as the starling, compensate for feeding resource difficulties (poor quality of food, accessibility) in habitats such as urban ecosystems and that its behavioural flexibility allows for similar breeding performance in rural and urban areas. Along an urbanisation gradient we compared simultaneously (1) success factors such as the abundance of breeding starlings, their breeding performance and the fitness of nestlings, and (2) possible flexibility quantified through the rate of parental food-provisioning, and the composition and the amount of food delivered to nestlings. Abundance of breeding starlings are similar throughout the urbanisation gradient, but urbanisation profoundly and negatively affects reproductive parameters of starlings. Differences in the amount of food delivered to nestlings by parents (less food in town centre), and the small masses of nestlings reared in the urban sectors support the idea that urban nestlings received insufficient food loads. Despite modifications to their diurnal food-provisioning rhythm and the incorporation of some human food refuse into their diet, starling parents have a significantly reduced production of young in the urban centre sector. We rebut the idea that the ""generalist"" starling is able to breed successfully anywhere: other more ""specialist"" species succeed in producing their young by innovating more in terms of diet resources. We suggest defining successful birds with respect to colonisation or invasion process through behavioural innovation rather than an ambiguous habitat generalist definition. © 2006 Elsevier Masson SAS.

[6]: Background: The ratio of habitat generalists to specialists in birds has been suggested as a good indicator of ecosystem changes due to e.g. climate change and other anthropogenic perturbations. Most studies focusing on this functional component of biodiversity originate, however, from temperate regions. The Eurasian Arctic tundra is currently experiencing an unprecedented combination of climate change, change in grazing pressure by domestic reindeer and growing human activity. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here we monitored bird communities in a tundra landscape harbouring shrub and open habitats in order to analyse bird habitat relationships and quantify habitat specialization. We used ordination methods to analyse habitat associations and estimated the proportions of specialists in each of the main habitats. Correspondence Analysis identified three main bird communities, inhabiting upland, lowland and dense willow shrubs. We documented a stable structure of communities despite large multiannual variations of bird density (from 90 to 175 pairs/km<sup>2</sup>). Willow shrub thickets were a hotspot for bird density, but not for species richness. The thickets hosted many specialized species whose main distribution area was south of the tundra. Conclusion/Significance: If current arctic changes result in a shrubification of the landscape as many studies suggested, we would expect an increase in the overall bird abundance together with an increase of local specialists, since they are associated with willow thickets. The majority of these species have a southern origin and their increase in abundance would represent a strengthening of the boreal component in the southern tundra, perhaps at the expense of species typical of the subarctic zone, which appear to be generalists within this zone. © 2012 Sokolov et al."
i_800,"Strategies to Enhance Reliability: 2. Use Simulation and Modeling Techniques - Numerical modeling and simulation techniques, such as the Monte Carlo method combining Kriging and Importance Sampling, can efficiently assess small failure probabilities in complex structures . These methods help validate and correct approximations with minimal computational effort.","Applying reliability methods to a complex structure is often delicate for two main reasons. First, such a structure is fortunately designed with codified rules leading to a large safety margin which means that failure is a small probability event. Such a probability level is difficult to assess efficiently. Second, the structure mechanical behaviour is modelled numerically in an attempt to reproduce the real response and numerical model tends to be more and more time-demanding as its complexity is increased to improve accuracy and to consider particular mechanical behaviour. As a consequence, performing a large number of model computations cannot be considered in order to assess the failure probability. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes an original and easily implementable method called AK-IS for active learning and Kriging-based Importance Sampling. This new method is based on the AK-MCS algorithm previously published by Echard et al. [AK-MCS: an active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo simulation. Structural Safety 2011;33(2):145-54]. It associates the Kriging metamodel and its advantageous stochastic property with the Importance Sampling method to assess small failure probabilities. It enables the correction or validation of the FORM approximation with only a very few mechanical model computations. The efficiency of the method is, first, proved on two academic applications. It is then conducted for assessing the reliability of a challenging aerospace case study submitted to fatigue. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."
i_1507,"Commonly Used Antibiotics: Fluoroquinolones: These are the second most widely prescribed antibiotics for patients with AVB, with a significant portion of patients receiving them during their hospital stay .","Background: Acute variceal hemorrhage is a serious complication of liver disease and hospital outcome is closely related to infection. Patients with cirrhosis are at greater risk for developing bacterial infection, which is associated with failure to control bleeding and higher rates of hospital mortality. Many clinical practice guidelines endorse antimicrobial prophylaxis as standard of care for cirrhotic patients. Objective: The present study was performed to characterize the use of antimicrobial therapy for patients hospitalized with acute variceal hemorrhage. Methods: Medical records of 98 patients hospitalized with suspected variceal hemorrhage were retrospectively reviewed. Results: One-half of the patients received antimicrobials at any time during their hospital admission, and in very few (24%) could prescribed therapy be considered prophylactic. Seventy-seven per cent of patients undergoing endoscopy did not receive an antimicrobial within 24 h of the procedure. Those who received antimicrobial therapy had more severe liver disease (model for end-stage liver disease scores of 19.5±10 versus 12.9±8, P<0.05; Child-Pugh class C 78% versus 65%, not significant) and worse in-hospital outcome (length of stay 17 versus 6.5 days, P<0.05; mortality 15 versus two, P<0.05). Cephalosporins were the most widely prescribed agents (45%), followed by fluoroquinolone (40%). Regimens ranged in length from single-dose administration to two weeks. Conclusions: Patients with liver disease admitted with variceal hemorrhage were often not prescribed antimicrobial therapy to reduce the risk of bacterial infection. These results imply that published practice guidelines are not being consistently observed. A large, well-designed study with mortality outcome may be required for clinical guidelines to be successfully implemented in practice. © 2005 Pulsus Group Inc. All rights reserved."
s_1398,Key Factors Contributing to Odor in Diabetic Foot Ulcers: Infection: Bacterial Infection: One of the primary contributors to the odor in DFUs is bacterial infection. Infections are common in diabetic ulcers and can lead to the production of malodorous compounds .,"The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying diabetic chronic wounds are complex and multifactorial. Neuropathy resulting in insensitivity, abnormal foot biomechanics and peripheral vascular disease, along with poor wound healing are the major contributors to the development of foot ulcers in diabetic patients. All of these factors are often indicated and are the source of delayed wound healing. Classifying ulcerations according to size, depth, presence or absence of infection, and vascular status are very important for determining the proper treatment. Proper offloading is vital for those patients with neuropathic lesions. Infections are among the most frequent and serious consequences of diabetic ulcers. They are the most common proximate cause of lower-extremity amputations. In cases of septic neuroischaemic foot, major amputation may be inevitable, but if the infection is not immediately life-threatening the infected part of the foot should be drained and debrided promptly and left wide open. After generation of a well-granulated wound bed, we applied a pure epidermal sheet graft (PESG) obtained by suction blisters from the trunk or thigh (nonpalmoplantar) skin. The clinical outcome of epidermal grafting without dermal components was excellent, especially in treating palmoplantar wounds, in terms of efficacy, with better graft take through keratinocyte activation and scarless healing of donor sites by obtaining the epidermal sheets by suction blister, and quality, site-specific differentiation through mesenchymal- epithelial interactions.
[2]: Diabetic foot ulcer is a rising health problem with rising prevalence of diabetes. It is the most important cause of non-traumatic foot amputations. Diabetic foot ulcers are primarily due to neuropathy and/ or ischaemia, and are frequently complicated by infection. Up to 85% of all diabetic foot related problems are preventable through a combination of good foot care and appropriate education for patients and healthcare providers. The holistic care of diabetic foot ulcer patients requires a multidisciplinary team approach. Apart from blood sugar control, treatment of ulcer involves debridement, offloading, appropriate dressings, vascular maintenance and infection control. Use of adjunctive treatments such as various growth factors, skin replacement dressings and vacuum assisted closure will accelerate healing in selected cases.
[3]: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) are a common complication of diabetes and present a significant health risk to patients, as well as impose a large economic burden. Evaluation for contributory factors that may impact general health or healing, such as hyperglycemia, peripheral artery disease, neuropathy, and nutritional status, is of the utmost importance. Management of DFUs requires involvement of a multidisciplinary team and a standardized approach to patient care. Standard therapy for DFUs includes offloading and debridement. Assessment and control of infection are critical, including determining the severity of the infection, which may drive therapeutic approaches. For recalcitrant ulcers, adjuvant therapies are used to hasten the healing process, and newer therapies are under investigation."
s_1422,"Effects of Various Supplements on Ruminal Fermentation: Condensed Tannins: Condensed tannins did not significantly affect total VFA concentration, but their reduction of specific VFA like isovalerate and isobutyrate suggests that they may have a more profound impact on overall fermentation efficiency than previously thought .","The addition of natural plant secondary compounds to ruminant feed has been extensively studied because of their ability to modify digestive and metabolic functions, resulting in a potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, among other benefits. Condensed tannin (CT) supplementation may alter ruminal fermentation and mitigate methane (CH4) emissions. This study's objective was to determine the effect of quebracho CT extract [QT; Schinopsis quebracho-colorado (Schltdl.) F.A. Barkley & T. Meyer] within a roughage-based diet on ruminal digestibility and kinetic parameters by using the in situ and in vitro gas production techniques, in addition to blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and ruminal (volatile fatty acid [VFA], NH3-N, and protozoa count) parameters. Twenty rumen-cannulated steers were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: QT at 0%, 1%, 2%, and 3% of dry matter (DM; QT0: 0% CT, QT1: 0.70% CT, QT2: 1.41% CT, and QT3: 2.13% CT). The in situ DM digestibility increased linearly (P = 0.048) as QT inclusion increased, whereas in situ neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD) was not altered among treatments (P = 0.980). Neither total VFA concentration nor acetate-to-propionate ratio differed among dietary treatments (P = 0.470 and P = 0.873, respectively). However, QT3 had lower isovalerate and isobutyrate concentrations compared with QT0 (P ≤ 0.025). Ruminal NH3 and BUN tended to decline (P ≤ 0.075) in a linear fashion as QT inclusion increased, suggesting decreased deamination of feed protein. Ruminal protozoa count was reduced in quadratic fashion (P = 0.005) as QT inclusion increased, where QT1 and QT2 were lower compared with QT0 and QT3. Urinary N excretion tended to reduce in a linear fashion (P = 0.080) as QT increased. There was a treatment (TRT) × Day interaction for in vitro total gas production and fractional rate of gas production (P = 0.013 and P = 0.007, respectively), and in vitro NDFD tended to be greater for QT treatments compared with no QT inclusion (P = 0.077). There was a TRT × Day interaction (P = 0.001) on CH4 production, with QT3 having less CH4 production relative to QT0 on day 0 and QT2 on days 7 and 28. Feeding QT up to 3% of the dietary DM in a roughage-based diet did not sacrifice the overall DM digestibility and ruminal parameters over time. Still, it is unclear why QT2 did not follow the same pattern as in vitro gas parameters. Detailed evaluations of amino acid degradation might be required to fully define CT influences on ruminal fermentation parameters and CH4 production."
i_112,"Interactive explanation interfaces, such as LIME, provide multiple levels of explanations, helping users understand both local and global behaviors of AI models .","The interdisciplinary field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to foster human understanding of black-box machine learning models through explanation-generating methods. In practice, Shapley explanations are widely used. However, they are often presented as visualizations and thus leave their interpretation to the user. As such, even ML experts have difficulties interpreting them appropriately. On the other hand, combining visual cues with textual rationales has been shown to facilitate understanding and communicative effectiveness. Further, the social sciences suggest that explanations are a social and iterative process between the explainer and the explainee. Thus, interactivity should be a guiding principle in the design of explanation facilities. Therefore, we (i) briefly review prior research on interactivity and naturalness in XAI, (ii) designed and implemented the interactive explanation interface SHAPRap that provides local and global Shapley explanations in an accessible format, and (iii) evaluated our prototype in a formative user study with 16 participants in a loan application scenario. We believe that interactive explanation facilities that provide multiple levels of explanations offer a promising approach for empowering humans to better understand a model's behavior and its limitations on a local as well as global level. With our work, we inform designers of XAI systems about human-centric ways to tailor explanation interfaces to end users."

The main reason is that it has the advantages of simple structure, relatively low price and convenient operation, which has made its development more and more rapid in recent years. However, due to the fact that the FDM products are susceptible to the operating environment, the printing quality is not stable enough and the development is restricted. In addition, this research uses Taguchi method to explore FDM to optimize a long and thin desired volume of the workpiece under different printing parameters (printing temperature, printing speed ratio, and printing layer thickness). From the experimental results, the size of the factors that affect the FDM's expected volume of the workpiece is, in order, the printing temperature is the most important, the printing speed ratio is the second, and the printing layer thickness is the smallest. The optimal parameter combination for the desired workpiece volume is A<inf>1</inf>B<inf>1</inf>C<inf>1</inf>, that is, the printing temperature is 190<sup>o</sup>C, the printing speed ratio is 0.286 (20 mm/s on the outer side, 70 mm/s on the inner side), and the printing layer thickness is 0.1 mm. Finally confirmed the experimental results and found that the volume error of the finished product using the best printing parameters is less than 0.3 %, which proves that the optimized printing parameters obtained by Taguchi method are indeed effective and feasible."

The participants were randomly divided into training group and control group, each 15 subjects. The training group was given neuromuscular electrical stimulating training 30min per day on the rectus-abdominis muscles around umbilicus: with frequency 30Hz, pulse width 300 μs, on and off ratio 1 =3, intensity 10-20mA. Both groups participant in workshops for body weight control once a week. Result:The women after 12 week electrical stimulating training showed lower BMI,WC, and HC than those in pre-training(P<0.001) and no significant difference was found in BW and WHR of them as comparing with pre-training (P>0.05). In the control group the BW, BMI, WC, and HC did not show significant change during experimental period (P>0.05). Compared with control group, in experiment group BW, BMI, WC,and HC decreased significantly (P<0.05). The women in training group had thinner thickness of visceral fat and greater thickness of rectus -abdominis muscle measured by ultrasonography than those in control group after 12 week intervention (P<0.05). Conclusion: Twelve week training with neuromuscular electrical stimulation on the rectus-abdominis muscle is a potent visceral fat lossing method for the women suffered from simple ventral obesity. It's effect is better than only education for weight control."

Consequently, fog computing emerges as a valid solution, since by performing local data pre-processing, the transmitted load is reduced. In addition, it grants the possibility of implementing adequate security measures, ensuring the veracity of the information. This research proposes the design of an IoT system for measuring environmental variables, consisting on a WSN, fog computing and cloud computing, which deploys end-to-end encryption techniques.

These symporters are stimulated by inositol polyphosphates, which enhance their activity .","Acidocalcisomes of Trypanosoma brucei and the acidocalcisome-like vacuoles of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are acidic calcium compartments that store polyphosphate (polyP). Both organelles possess a phosphate–sodium symporter (TbPho91 and Pho91p in T. brucei and yeast, respectively), but the roles of these transporters in growth and orthophosphate (P<inf>i</inf>) transport are unclear.

i_151,"AI can help in detecting and preventing data breaches, which is essential for protecting inadequately secured dark data .","Online assurance is one of the different occupations of man-made awareness. A report by Norton showed that the overall cost of ordinary data breach recovery is $3.86 million. The report furthermore shows that organizations normally need 196 days to recover from any data breach. Thus, organizations should use additional artificial intelligence (AI) to avoid waste of time and financial disasters caused due to data breach. Computerized reasoning, AI, and risk knowledge can see the plans in data to enable security systems acquire from past experience. Moreover, AI enables organizations to decrease scene response times and comply with best security practices. Present state-of-the-art instruments utilized in cybercrime investigation depend on inconsequential watchword search and manual substance investigation by a human master. Simultaneously, late improvements likewise added estimated design coordinating, thus called e-Discovery that aids, and improves on, the manual work of criminology examinations. Notwithstanding, big data issues need an alternative way to deal with or tackle enormous information seized or corresponded for a criminal case. In this way, there is a solid need to apply artificial intelligence (AI) and automated reasoning models to do quick and convenient information handling. Cybercriminals represent a danger to all kinds of organizations, and the clients and buyers who use them. A portion of the numbers engaged with the biggest information breach is faltering, with individual information concerning countless people being leaked, thereby making everyone conceivably another casualty of extortion and other cybercrimes. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly put to use in online protection, with security devices examining information from a large number of digital episodes and utilizing that information to recognize likely dangers - a user account acting peculiarly when tapping on a phishing joins, for instance, or another variation of malware. The AI data set can draw upon data about any type of malware that has been distinguished previously. So when another type of malware shows up - either a variation of the existing malware or a completely different type of malware - the framework can actually take a look at it against the information base, inspecting the code and hindering the assault by the malware on the premise that comparative occasions have recently been considered as vindictive. Be that as it may, there is a constant fight among assailants and protectors. Since a long time, cybercriminals have attempted to change their malware code such that security programming no longer remembers the code as noxious. The aim of this chapter is to investigate and comprehend the effects of computerized reasoning in the fields of public safety and security; to distinguish the political, international, and vital issues of AI; to examine AI's place in clashes and cyberconflicts, and all the more, by and large in different types of violence; to clarify the use of man-made brainpower by military organizations, law enforcement agencies, and the police; and to talk about the enquiries made using the advancement of man-made consciousness and the increase in utilization of man-made consciousness in armed forces, police, and knowledge organizations, at the strategic, functional, and key levels."
i_1065,"5. Aminoglycosides: Such as gentamicin and amikacin, are used in more severe cases or when resistance to other antibiotics is present .","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are a growing concern due to limited therapeutic options. Gram-negative bacteria, specifically Enterobacteriaceae, are common causes of both community-acquired and hospital acquired UTIs. These organisms can acquire genes that encode for multiple antibiotic resistance mechanisms, including extended-spectrum-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC- β -lactamase, and carbapenemases. The assessment of suspected UTI includes identification of characteristic symptoms or signs, urinalysis, dipstick or microscopic tests, and urine culture if indicated. UTIs are categorized according to location (upper versus lower urinary tract) and severity (uncomplicated versus complicated). Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance necessitate judicious use of antibiotics through the application of antimicrobial stewardship principles. Knowledge of the common causative pathogens of UTIs including local susceptibility patterns are essential in determining appropriate empiric therapy. The recommended first-line empiric therapies for acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis in otherwise healthy adult nonpregnant females is a 5-day course of nitrofurantion or a 3-g single dose of fosfomycin tromethamine. Second-line options include fluoroquinolones and β-lactams, such as amoxicillin-clavulanate. Current treatment options for UTIs due to AmpC- β -lactamase-producing organisms include fosfomycin, nitrofurantion, fluoroquinolones, cefepime, piperacillin–tazobactam and carbapenems. In addition, treatment options for UTIs due to ESBLs–producing Enterobacteriaceae include nitrofurantion, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, cefoxitin, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, and aminoglycosides. Based on identification and susceptibility results, alternatives to carbapenems may be used to treat mild-moderate UTIs caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftazidime-avibactam, colistin, polymixin B, fosfomycin, aztreonam, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline are treatment options for UTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Treatment options for UTIs caused by multidrug resistant (MDR)-Pseudomonas spp. include fluoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, colistin, ceftazidime-avibactam, and ceftolozane-tazobactam. The use of fluoroquinolones for empiric treatment of UTIs should be restricted due to increased rates of resistance. Aminoglycosides, colistin, and tigecycline are considered alternatives in the setting of MDR Gram-negative infections in patients with limited therapeutic options.
[3]: Urinary tract infections (UTI) are a very common reason for consultation and prescription in current practice. Excessive or inappropriate use of antibiotics in treating urinary tract infections is responsible for the emergence and spread of multiresistant uropathogenic bacteria. Aim of the study: To evaluate the isolation frequency and antibiotic resistance of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains isolated at the Marrakech region. Material and methods: We conducted a retrospective study over a period of three years (from 1st January 2010 to 31 December 2012). It included all non-redundant uropathogenic E.coli strains isolated in the microbiology laboratory of the Avicenne hospital of Marrakech, Morocco. Results: During this study, 1472 uropathogenic enterobacteriaceae were isolated including 924 non-repetitive E.coli strains, an overall isolation frequency of 63%. Antibiotic resistance of isolated E.. coli strains showed resistance rates to amoxicillin (65%), sulfamethoxazole-triméthropime (55%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (43%), ciprofloxacin (22%), gentamicin (14%), nitrofurans (11%), amikacin (8%) and fosfomycin (7%). The number of E.. coli strains resistant to C3G by ESBL production was 67, an average frequency of 4.5% of all isolated uropathogenic enterobacteria. The associated antibiotic resistance in the case of ESBL-producing E.coli were 82% for ciprofloxacin, 76% for sulfamethozole trimethoprim, 66% for gentamicin and 56% for amikacin. No resistance to imipenem was recorded for the isolated E.coli strains, which represents an imipenem sensitivity of 100%. Conclusion: Antibiotic resistance of uropathogenic E.. coli strains limits treatment options and therefore constitutes a real public health problem. The regular updating of antibiotic susceptibility statistics of E.coli strains allows a better adaptation of the probabilistic antibiotic therapy to local epidemiological data. Level of evidence: 5.
[4]: Objective: Urinary tract infection is one of the most common bacterial diseases in elderly patients. The objective of this study is to determine the antibiotic resistance rates against first-line antibiotics used for the treatment of community-acquired urinary tract infections in elderly patients at our hospital, and use the results as guidance for empirical antibiotic therapy. Methods: In this study, data on all elderly patients aged 65 and older who were followed and treated in our hospital between March 2010 and March 2012 were evaluated retrospectively. Results: 406 microorganisms were isolated from the urine cultures of 401 patients included in the study, because 5 (1.2%) patients harbored two microorganisms. Of the 406 microorganisms, 320 (78.8%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 72 (17.7%) were Gram-positive cocci and 14 (3.5%) were Candida spp. Escherich-ia coli (n=262, 64.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=27, 6.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=17, 4.1%) were the most common among Gram-negatives, and Enterococcus faecalis (n=36, 8.9%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (n=25, 6.2%) were the most common among Gram-positives. Susceptibility rates of E. coli strains were 89% for nitrofurantoin, 81% for trime-thoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 77% for amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 70% for gentamicin and 66% for ciprofoxacin. Conclusions: Antimicrobial resistance must be monitored at each hospital in order to make correct choices for empirical antibiotic therapy. Surveillance studies are helpful for this purpose. In conclusion, nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxa-zole can safely be used for the empirical treatment of urinary tract infections in elderly patients."
s_1839,Community-Level Strategies: Local Motivators: Utilizing local volunteers to disseminate information and promote waste segregation can effectively increase household participation in recycling activities .,"Background: Segregation of household waste at the source is an effective and sustainable strategy for management of municipal waste. However, household segregation levels remain insufficient as waste management approaches are mostly top down and lack local support. The realisation and recognition of effective, improved and adequate waste management may be one of the vital drivers for attaining environmental protection and improved health and well-being. The presence of a local level motivator may promote household waste segregation and ultimately pro-environmental behaviour. The present cluster randomized control trial aims to understand if volunteer based information on waste segregation (I-MISS) can effectively promote increased waste segregation practices at the household level when compared with existing routine waste segregation information in an urban Indian setting. Methods: This paper describes the protocol of an 18 month two-group parallel,cluster randomised controlled trialin the urban setting of Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, India. Randomization will be conducted at ward level, which is the last administrative unit of the municipality. The study will recruit 425 households in intervention and control groups. Assessments will be performed at baseline (0 months), midline (6 months), end line (12 months) and post intervention (18 months). The primary outcome will be the comparison of change in proportion of households practicing waste segregation and change in proportion of mis-sorted waste across the study period between the intervention and control groups as assessed by pick analysis. Intention to treat analysis will be conducted. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. Discussion: The present study is designed to study whether an external motivator, a volunteer selected from the participating community and empowered with adequate training, could disseminate waste segregation information to their community, thus promoting household waste segregation and ultimately pro-environmental behaviour. The study envisages that the volunteers could link waste management service providers and the community, give a local perspective to waste management, and help to change community habits through information, constant communication and feedback. Trial registration: The study is registered prospectively with Indian Council of Medical Research- Clinical Trial Registry of India (CTRI/2020/03/024278)."

This chapter discusses some examples relating to key factors in prosperity: natural catastrophe, capital markets and diversity and inclusion. Many countries lack broad and deep capital markets, and this is becoming more of an issue as governments try to encourage long term saving and develop private pension schemes. Currently, humans are investigating suspicious-looking entities, but it is likely that over time AI and machine learning can take over a lot of this activity and also help prevent fraud.

i_1890,"Water and Soil Conservation: These forests play a significant role in regulating the hydrological cycle, ensuring continuous water supply, and preventing soil erosion. They help maintain water quality and reduce the risk of floods .","Climate change and loss of biodiversity are widely recognized as the foremost environmental challenges of our time. Forests annually sequester large quantities of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<inf>2</inf>), and store carbon above and below ground for long periods of time. Intact forests—largely free from human intervention except primarily for trails and hazard removals—are the most carbon-dense and biodiverse terrestrial ecosystems, with additional benefits to society and the economy. Internationally, focus has been on preventing loss of tropical forests, yet U.S. temperate and boreal forests remove sufficient atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> to reduce national annual net emissions by 11%. U.S. forests have the potential for much more rapid atmospheric CO<inf>2</inf> removal rates and biological carbon sequestration by intact and/or older forests. The recent 1.5 Degree Warming Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change identifies reforestation and afforestation as important strategies to increase negative emissions, but they face significant challenges: afforestation requires an enormous amount of additional land, and neither strategy can remove sufficient carbon by growing young trees during the critical next decade(s). In contrast, growing existing forests intact to their ecological potential—termed proforestation—is a more effective, immediate, and low-cost approach that could be mobilized across suitable forests of all types. Proforestation serves the greatest public good by maximizing co-benefits such as nature-based biological carbon sequestration and unparalleled ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and air quality, flood and erosion control, public health benefits, low impact recreation, and scenic beauty.
[4]: Forests play a primordial role for life on Earth. Beyond their contribution as a major source of raw materials and renewable energy, they also hold an inestimable treasure of biodiversity. They ensure the protection of arable land, are a continuous source of water and contribute to improved air quality. Whether for food or pharmacopoeia, forests are the principal source of subsistence for almost 2 billion people."

i_1561,"Key Points from the Research: Environmental Impact of Waste Tires: Waste tires are an overwhelming environmental problem because they are completely non-biodegradable and take an eternity to degrade naturally, which is the sole reason for their environmental impact .","Recycling and recovery of waste tires is a serious environmental problem since vulcanized rubbers require several years to degrade naturally and remain for long periods of time in the environment. This is associated to a complex three dimensional (3D) crosslinked structure and the presence of a high number of different additives inside a tire formulation. Most end-of-life tires are discarded as waste in landfills taking space or incinerated for energy recovery, especially for highly degraded rubber wastes. All these options are no longer acceptable for the environment and circular economy. However, a great deal of progress has been made on the sustainability of waste tires via recycling as this material has high potential being a source of valuable raw materials. Extensive researches were performed on using these end-of-life tires as fillers in civil engineering applications (concrete and asphalt), as well as blending with polymeric matrices (thermoplastics, thermosets or virgin rubber). Several grinding technologies, such as ambient, wet or cryogenic processes, are widely used for downsizing waste tires and converting them into ground tire rubber (GTR) with a larger specific surface area. Here, a focus is made on the use of GTR as a partial replacement in virgin rubber compounds. The paper also presents a review of the possible physical and chemical surface treatments to improve the GTR adhesion and interaction with different matrices, including rubber regeneration processes such as thermomechanical, microwave, ultrasonic and thermochemical producing regenerated tire rubber (RTR). This review also includes a detailed discussion on the effect of GTR/RTR particle size, concentration and crosslinking level on the curing, rheological, mechanical, aging, thermal, dynamic mechanical and swelling properties of rubber compounds. Finally, a conclusion on the current situation is provided with openings for future works.
[2]: The problem of recycling worn car tires is ecologically and economically important. Wornoff tires are a source of long-term environmental pollution. Tires subject to no biological decomposition, they are inflammable and being ignited 1 ton of tires releases in the atmosphere 270 kg of carbon black and 45 kg of toxic gases. At the same time, they contain valuable raw materials such as rubber resin and metal. The most optimum of all known tire-recycling methods is low-temperature pyrolysis that provides complete recycling of tires with recovery of useful products: liquid pyrolysis fuel, carbon residue and PYROGAS. To implement this technique and to ensure its economic effect we have developed and patented a compact self-contained outfit of equipment that requires minimal working areas and operating force, atmospheric emission of harmful components during its operation does not exceed maximum-allowable concentration rates.
[3]: A huge amount of waste tires is generated every day in the world. This determines the search for ways to use them. The extended process of production and application of scrap tires leads to their significant mass accumulation, thus representing environmental risk. Tires are inert materials, extremely difficult to treat, and nonbiodegradable. In recent years, many plants have been built for processing, treatment, and utilization of this kind of waste. A problem has emerged to find a suitable, environmentally friendly application of the products (gaseous, liquid, and solid) from pyrolysis of the tires. Pyrolysis oil, which is a liquid product, is not suitable for direct use as fuel because of its high sulfur content. Therefore, the desulfurization of pyrolytic tire oil is an important part of the oil production process prior to its use. The objective of this article is to review the methods used for desulfurization of waste tire pyrolysis oils and the possibility of using scrap tires as a source of energy.
[4]: The waste rubber and end-of-life tires management has become a serious environmental problem. It is well known that the best way to carry out the disposal of these wastes is through recycling by devulcanization. Therefore, in the last decades, many methods have been developed to perform this treatment. Nevertheless, the degree and quality of the achieved devulcanization is still difficult to evaluate. The Horikx theory is an approach often used for this purpose. Hence, in this work, the validity of this theory was experimentally checked. The theoretical curve that represents crosslink scission was experimentally built for sulfur-cured natural rubber, sulfur-cured natural rubber reinforced with carbon black, sulfur-cured ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber and peroxide-cured ethylene propylene diene monomer rubber. Several samples with vulcanization (or devulcanization) degree ranging from 0 to 100% were processed, and the corresponding soluble fractions and crosslink densities were measured by the swelling test. The experimental results were in good agreement with the theoretical predictions, independently of the studied material, fact that confirms the validity of the Horikx approach. This finding will contribute to improve the waste rubber devulcanization, and therefore to progress in the environmental protection."

Collaborative learning is one such pedagogy of engagement to achieve the same. In addition, the implementation of OBEE demands the adoption of corporate best practices in deploying new initiatives, which streamlines the process, removes waste in the process, and ensures sustainment of the improved process. Lean Thinking is one such approach adopted by the industry to ensure productivity, performance, and sustainment of new initiatives. The objective of this paper is to study the scope of collaborative learning in OBEE based on the Lean Thinking approach, and to explore its successful deployment in Indian higher education. Statement of Contribution/Methods - The research reported in this paper is based on Action Research methodology carried out using the Lean Thinking PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) approach and its application in improving OBEE through collaborative learning in India. STAD (Student-Teams-Achievement-Division) collaborative learning was deployed through heterogeneous group formation for enhancing the teaching-learning process. The Indo-Universal Collaboration on Engineering Education (IUCEE) consortium knowledge base and assistance has been effectively used to chalk out the strategy for effective deployment. Basic statistics and outlier analysis is used to draw the inferences. Results, Discussion, and Conclusions - The study describes the effective deployment of collaborative learning to enhance the effectiveness of the OBEE ecosystem through students? performance by utilizing the power of Lean Thinking. The study shows that not only Turn-Around-Time (TAT) of the deployment process is enhanced, but also the attainment of the students? performance. Moreover, it improves team spirit and team performance during the process. The paper is based on a single case study executed in an engineering college and hence, there is limitation in generalizing the specific results from the study. But the approach adopted and the learning from this study can be generalized. The study is of use to academicians, researchers, practitioners, and policymakers seeking to implement collaborative learning for an OBEE set- up with optimal utilization of the available resources based on the Lean Thinking platform in their organizations. This approach ensures value-added activity throughout the process and effective utilization of industrial best practices to higher education. Although collaborative learning and Lean Thinking have been extremely successful in the education sector and the corporate sector, respectively, the application of both to the engineering education has been limited. In addition, it describes the end-to-end implementation strategy of OBEE starting from planning, execution, meticulous assessment, and sustainment of the improved process in a step-by-step approach. This study illustrates how its application can improve the performance of the process and thus, productivity in the course."
i_271,"Key Characteristics: Decentralization: VCs are often used in decentralized systems, leveraging decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to ensure immutability and trust .","A verifiable credential (VC) has been standardized and applied in vari-ous domains, including education. Due to its immutability, blockchain has been considered and used for credential issuance and verification. Most existing methods, however, are not compatible with the W3C VC stan-dard. In this paper, an on-chain VC issuance and verification method has been described. The method is based on the standard VC data model and applicable to any credential type. It decomposes a VC document into a VC template and the corresponding value array(s). This allows a VC to be issued on-chain in the Bitcoin BTC network, which has a limited data-embedding capacity. The proposed method reduces blockchain resource consumption due to the reusability of a VC template. In addition, it allows the use of a concise VC fingerprint format instead of a full VC for credential exchange. Two issuance modes, namely the full on-chain and partial on-chain, are proposed targeting different use cases. The proposed method has been applied for issuing and verifying two learning credential types. The method was evaluated on the Bitcoin Testnet to measure time and space complexities. With the reduced-size VC fingerprint, the proposed method can embed a VC on a traditional paper-based credential as a compact-sized QR code. The proposed method ofiered faster VC issuance and verification than an existing standard-based verifiable credential method.
[3]: Protecting patient information's confidentiality is paramount considering the widespread use of Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets in medical settings. This study's subjects are decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) in conjunction with an OAuth-based authorization framework, as they are the key to protecting IoT healthcare devices. DIDs enable autonomous authentication and trust formation between IoT devices and other entities. To authorize users and enforce access controls based on verified claims, VCs offer a secure and adaptable solution. Through the proposed framework, medical facilities can improve the privacy and security of their IoT devices while streamlining access control administration. An Smart pill dispenser in a hospital setting is used to illustrate the advantages of this method. The findings demonstrate the value of DIDs, VCs, and OAuth-based delegation in protecting the IoT devices.

i_2274,"In the case of the crepuscular-bee-pollinated plant Trembleya laniflora, individual generalization in pollinator interactions was linked to higher reproductive success, suggesting that generalist behaviors can mitigate the costs of specialization, and it is possible that these generalist behaviors also enhance the plant's resilience to environmental changes .","Background and Aims: Plant individuals within a population differ in their phenology and interactions with pollinators. However, it is still unknown how individual differences affect the reproductive success of plants that have functionally specialized pollination systems. Here, we evaluated whether plant individual specialization in phenology (temporal specialization) and in pollination (pollinator specialization) affect the reproductive success of the crepuscular-bee-pollinated plant Trembleya laniflora (Melastomataceae). Methods: We quantified flowering activity (amplitude, duration and overlap), plant-pollinator interactions (number of flowers visited by pollinators) and reproductive success (fruit set) of T. laniflora individuals from three distinct locations in rupestrian grasslands of southeastern Brazil. We estimated the degree of individual temporal specialization in flowering phenology and of individual specialization in plant-pollinator interactions, and tested their relationship with plant reproductive success. Key Results: Trembleya laniflora presented overlapping flowering, a temporal generalization and specialized pollinator interactions. Flowering overlap among individuals and populations was higher than expected by chance but did not affect the individual interactions with pollinators and nor their reproductive success. In contrast, higher individual generalization in the interactions with pollinators was related to higher individual reproductive success. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that individual generalization in plant-pollinator interaction reduces the potential costs of specialization at the species level, ensuring reproductive success. Altogether, our results highlight the complexity of specialization/generalization of plant-pollinator interactions at distinct levels of organization, from individuals to populations, to species."

A change between environmental factors has been assumed the first mechanism restricting survival of larvae. Therefore, Zoea I and Zoea 2 larvae of P. pelagicus were exposed to various regimes of activity stress tests such as oxygen, starvation, pH, temperature, and salinity to examine larval competency against these factors. Larval performance was affected at extreme increase or by decreases in stress activity. In oxygen test, no survival achieved in treated groups. However, only some Zoea 2 survived in starvation test. Temperature 30°C did produce highest survival (p<0.05) and elevated temperature stress adversely affected larvae and no survival was achieved at temperature 40°C and 45°C respectively. Low pH 4, 6 and higher pH 10 did affect negatively, thus no survival of larvae, and only pH 8 did produce better survival (p<0.05). However, salinity greatly influenced the larval survival and only low survival 4.67±1.15% of Zoea 1 larvae and 5.33±1.53% of Zoea 2 determined at salinity 40 ppt was not significantly different (p>0.05). The significantly highest survival (p<0.05) of larvae was achieved in untreated groups (controls). The findings of this study indicate that the larval survival of P. pelagicus was compromised with certain level of stressor, elevated and low stressor had shown unfavourable effect on larval survival. [6] In fjord systems, freshwater inputs occur by ice melting and river discharge, affecting seawater salinity along fjord and adjacent waters, and potentially the ecology of early life stages of marine fish occurring in the area. During austral spring 2008, a bio-oceanographic cruise was carried out in southern Chile between 47°00′ and 50°09′S, an area influenced by Baker River discharge and ice melting of Northern and Southern Ice Fields, the largest glaciers from Patagonia. Surface salinity and temperature ranged from 1. 22 to 32. 80, and from 8. 11 to 10. 68°C, respectively. Larval lightfish Maurolicus parvipinnis (Sternoptychidae) and Falkland sprat Sprattus fuegensis (Clupeidae) were the dominant species, with abundances of 2. 2-39. 9 larvae 10 m<sup>-2</sup> and 3. 4-77. 1 larvae 10 m<sup>-2</sup>, respectively. Postflexion stages of both species were collected mainly in surface density fronts. Otolith-based growth analyses estimated linear growth rates of 0. 136 mm day<sup>-1</sup> for M. parvipinnis of 4. 1-15. 1 mm, and 0. 448 mm day<sup>-1</sup> for S. fuegensis of 5. 4-20. 5 mm. Recent Otolith Growth Index (ROGI), based on the residual analysis of the relationship between increment width of outermost five microincrements and otolith radius, indicates that larval M. parvipinnis collected in low salinity waters showed a reduction of its recent growth rate compared those collected in saltier waters. Also, ROGI was positively correlated with salinity of the water column for larval M. parvipinnis. Gut content analysis showed that large larvae collected near sources of freshwater had lower number of prey in its guts and preyed on different items than fish larvae collected in saltier waters. Therefore, freshwater inputs from rivers and glaciers from Patagonia affected horizontal distribution, recent growth and feeding of larval fish in fjords and channels of southern Chile. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Collectively, small pelagic fish often occupy a central role in the food web they occur in, often described as a wasp-waist ecosystem. Humans are an integral part of those ecosystems. Variability of populations of small pelagic fish is believed to be due primarily to variations in climate and fishing, but the mechanisms of these relations remain unknown in most cases. It is also uncertain whether these ecosystems alternate between states, e.g. regimes, and whether inherent variability may limit our ability to predict their future states. The fisheries for populations of small pelagic fish are increasingly global in nature. While the global catch of small pelagic fish constitutes approximately one quarter of the world fish catch and has been relatively constant during the past several decades, the catch of individual taxa and stocks varies much more. The management of these fisheries will be challenged by increasing demand for human consumption and mariculture in light of their finite and variable production, importance within the ecosystem, and unprecedented climate change, and will depend on both science and governance. We recommend continued, global research on climate change effects on small pelagic fish, and its periodic assessment for use by decision makers."
i_828,"Propane: Propane has a higher octane rating than gasoline, allowing for higher compression ratios without knocking, which can enhance engine performance and efficiency. Studies show that propane engines can achieve higher brake thermal efficiency and lower brake-specific energy consumption compared to gasoline engines .","This paper investigates the use of alternative gaseous fuels in port fuel injection spark ignition engines via the Lotus engine simulation program. To this end, the engine model for a port fuel injection spark ignition engine was designed, and engine performance was determined separately for gasoline and alternative gaseous fuels, i.e. compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas. According to the results, brake thermal efficiency increases while engine performance and fuel consumption decrease with methane and propane when compared to gasoline under the same conditions. While a slight increase in the fuel/air equivalence ratio of gaseous fuels improves the engine performance, fuel consumption remains almost stable. Another factor that enhances engine performance is the increasing compression ratio for methane and propane. In this manner, performance values that are closer/equal to gasoline are achieved. Under these conditions, fuel consumption decreases notably, while significant increases are observed in brake thermal efficiency. © 2011 Energy Institute.
[3]: Compressed natural gas is in automotive industry recognized as one of the ""cleanest"" fossil fuels which can be used in internal combustion engines with a number of benefits. Since natural gas has much higher octane rating than gaso-line it is expected that higher compression ratios can be used. The goal of the re-search is to determine the change of performance of spark ignited engine with the increase of compression ratio to values similar to compression ignited engine while keeping the exhaust emissions on the acceptable level and avoiding knock combustion. Measurements are performed at compression ratios 12, 16, and 18 at three different values of air excess ratio. Methane with known composition from a pressure cylinder is used instead of natural gas and the results are com-prised of indicating results (in-cylinder and intake pressure in a crank angle space), emissions, temperatures, and mass-flows on various intake and exhaust positions. Analysis of results shows high influence of compression ratio and ex-cess air ratio on combustion, performance, and exhaust gas emissions.
[4]: Considering the importance of alternative fuels in IC engines for environment safety, compressed natural gas has been extensively employed in SI engines. However, scarce efforts have been made to investigate the effect of compressed natural gas on engine lubricant oil for a long duration. In this regard, a comprehensive analysis has been made on the engine performance, emissions, and lubricant oil conditions using gasoline (G)<inf>92</inf> and compressed natural gas at different operating conditions using reliable sampling methods. The key parameters of the engine performance like brake power and brake-specific energy consumption were investigated at 80% throttle opening within 1500–4500 range of r/min. For the sake of emission tests, speed was varied uniformly by varying the load at a constant throttle. Furthermore, the engine was run at high and low loads for lubricant oil comparison. Although compressed natural gas showed a decrease in brake-specific energy consumption (7.94%) and emissions content, (G)<inf>92</inf> performed relatively better in the case of brake power (39.93% increase). Moreover, a significant improvement was observed for wear debris, lubricant oil physiochemical characteristics, and additives depletion in the case of compressed natural gas than those of (G)<inf>92</inf>. The contents of metallic particles were decreased by 23.58%, 36.25%, 42.42%, and 66.67% for iron, aluminum, copper, and lead, respectively, for compressed natural gas."

Weekly resolved remotely sensed sea surface temperature, surface chlorophyll, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy data were used for the year 2004. Fifteen generalized additive models were constructed with skipjack catch per unit effort as a response variable, and sea surface temperature, sea surface height anomalies and eddy kinetic energy as model covariates to assess the effect of environment on catch per unit effort (skipjack tuna abundance). Model selection was based on significance of model terms, reduction in Akaike's Information Criterion, and increase in cumulative deviance explained. The model selected was used to predict skipjack tuna catch per unit effort using monthly resolved environmental data for assessing model performance and to visualize the basin scale distribution of skipjack tuna habitat. Predicted values were validated using a linear model. Based on the four-parameter model, skipjack tuna habitat selection was significantly (P < 0.01) influenced by sea surface temperatures ranging from 20.5 to 26°C, relatively oligotrophic waters (surface chlorophyll 0.08-0.18, 0.22-0.27 and 0.3-0.37 mg m<sup>-3</sup>), zero to positive anomalies (surface height anomalies 0-50 cm), and low to moderate eddy kinetic energy (0-200 and 700-2500 cm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-2</sup>). Predicted catch per unit effort showed a trend consistent with the north-south migration of skipjack tuna. Validation of predicted catch per unit effort with that observed, pooled monthly, was significant (P < 0.01, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.64). Sea surface temperature explained the highest deviance in generalized additive models and was therefore considered the best habitat predictor. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
s_1563,"Key Points: Nutritional Composition: TM larvae are known to contain low amounts of proteins, saturated fatty acids, and negligible minerals .","Tenebrio molitor are large insects and their larvae are consumed as food in many countries. The nutritional composition of T. molitor has been studied and contains high amounts of proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, and valuable minerals. However, the bioactivity of T. molitor has not been fully understood. We examined the effects of T. molitor extracts on resistance to oxidative stress and organism's lifespan using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system. The response to heat shock and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation was monitored in vivo. The extracts from T. molitor showed significant effects on resistance to oxidative stress and UV irradiation and extend both mean and maximum lifespan of C. Elegans. The number of progeny produced significantly increased in animals supplemented with T. molitor extracts. In addition, the expression of hsp-16.2 and sod-3 was markedly upregulated by supplementation with T. molitor extracts. These findings suggest that T. molitor extracts can increase response to stressors and extend lifespan by the induction of longevity assurance genes in C. Elegans.
[2]: Nowadays, it is urgent to produce in larger quantities and more sustainably to reduce the gap between food supply and demand. In a circular bioeconomy vision, insects receive great attention as a sustainable alternative to satisfy food and nutritional needs. Among all insects, Tenebrio molitor (TM) is the first insect approved by the European Food Safety Authority as a novel food in specific conditions and uses, testifying its growing relevance and potential. This review holistically presents the possible role of TM in the sustainable and circular solution to the growing needs for food and nutrients. We analyze all high value-added products obtained from TM (powders and extracts, oils and fatty acids, proteins and peptides, and chitin and chitosan), their recovery processes (evaluating the best ones in technical and environmental terms), their nutritional and economical values, and their biological effects. Safety aspects are also mentioned. TM potential is undoubted, but some aspects still need to be discussed, including the health effects of substances and microorganisms in its body, the optimal production conditions (that affect product quality and safety), and TM capacity to convert by-products into new products. Environmental, economic, social, and market feasibility studies are also required to analyze the new value chains. Finally, to unlock the enormous potential of edible insects as a source of nutritious and sustainable food, it will be necessary to overcome the cultural, psychological, and regulatory barriers still present in Western countries."
i_722,"Applications and Results: Vibration Absorbers: Multi-objective optimization methods using genetic algorithms have proven ineffective in designing vibration absorbers for cracked beams, failing to reduce dynamic deflection even in the presence of structural damage .","This study presents a multi-objective optimization method for designing a vibration absorber to reduce the vibrations of a cracked Euler–Bernoulli beam with flexible support under moving forces. Using the assumption of an open crack, the crack is modeled as a decrease in cross-sectional flexibility. After adding an absorber to the beam, the effect of cracks with different intensities on its vibration behavior was examined. First, the dynamic response of the cracked beam has been determined under the influence of different speeds of the moving force. Genetic algorithms have been used to optimize the parameters of the absorber and to examine the effect of mass and damping constant on its efficiency. Despite cracks increasing the dynamic deflection of a beam with an absorber, a cracked beam without an absorber still gains more dynamic deflection than one with an absorber. As a result, vibration absorbers that are designed for a healthy beam are still effective in reducing the dynamic deflection of the beam following the occurrence of cracks and changes in the structure's dynamics."
i_1188,"Emotional and Physical Support: Caregivers frequently address the emotional and behavioral needs of stroke survivors, which is a high priority during the initial stages of caregiving . This support is essential for the mental well-being of both the caregiver and the stroke survivor.","Purpose: Programmes that address stroke family caregiver needs and skill-building are recommended based on the literature and patient care guidelines for stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this study was to explore patterns of perceived needs and skill-building during a stroke caregiver intervention programme. Method: Descriptive statistics were used to analyse data from 123 stroke caregivers enrolled in the intervention group of a randomised controlled clinical trial. Caregivers received eight weekly telephone sessions, with a booster session a month later. At each session, the Caregiver Needs and Concerns Checklist (CNCC) was used to identify and prioritise current needs that were then addressed through skill-building strategies. Results: Perceived needs changed over time. Information about stroke was the highest priority need during Session 1. Managing survivor emotions and behaviours was the highest priority for Sessions 2 through 4. Caregivers generally waited until Sessions 5 through 9 to address their own emotional and physical health needs. Physical and instrumental care needs were relatively low but stable across all nine sessions. Skill-building was consistently high, though it peaked during Sessions 2 and 3. Conclusions: Tracking patterns of needs and skill-building suggest appropriate timing for targeting different types of family caregiver support during stroke rehabilitation. Implications for Rehabilitation Family caregivers of stroke survivors play an essential role in the rehabilitation process of the stroke survivor. Identifying and addressing the priority needs and concerns of stroke caregivers during the early discharge period enables caregivers to provide sustained support for the stroke survivor. Rehabilitation professionals are in a key position to address evolving caregiver needs and concerns as they transition to home settings with follow-up care."

Some tasks at assembly workstations require human workers to stand for a prolonged period of time to assemble the products. Approach: This study was conducted at an automotive component manufacturer. Twenty fulltime workers working at the assembly line participated as subjects in this study. Observations were made and recorded with respect to working postures practiced while performing their assembly tasks. In addition, subjects' anthropometric data and current workstations dimensions were measured to determine whether they are suitable or not to perform the assembly tasks. Results: The findings from this study showed that there are four types of awkward postures and anthropometric data mismatches that had contributed to Musculoskeletal Disorders (MSDs) problems, faced by the subjects. Conclusion: The findings from this study shows the current assembly workstation at Company A need to be redesign to eliminate awkward postures and anthropometric mismatches to lower MSDs problem and improve productivity among assembly workers. © 2011 Science Publications. [7] Cell production in which a few human workers operate robots to manufacture products is popular in Japan due to its flexibility. However, it is difficult for human workers to teach the robots to perform the assembly tasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a hierarchical knowledge based system to facilitate teaching robots the assembly tasks. The hierarchical knowledge based system divides the teaching task into 3 levels: 1. the task level - human workers breakdown the complex assembly task with HTA (hierarchical task analysis); 2. the plan level - human workers teach robots to assemble each workpiece with the plan knowledge base; 3. the command level - with the command knowledge base, the assembling plan of each workpiece is translated into robot commands and executed by robots. As the knowledge bases in this system updated and augmented during each teaching task, the human workers' assembling and teaching skills will be accumulated in the system to ease future teaching tasks. © 2009 IFAC. [8] Introduction of robots into manual assembly lines to assist human workers or introduction of human into robot-based manufacturing attracts more and more attention in academy and industry. This interest stems from the insight that the integration of robots into manual assembly lines or vice versa may increase productivity by combining the abilities of machines with those of humans. To uphold productivity while respecting safety constraints is the target, and one of the challenges is how to productively distribute tasks among workers and robots. We studied one small-part assembly scenario, namely the assembly of a PLC Input/Output module by an ABB Dual Arm Concept Robot and a human worker. A method is proposed in this paper to optimize the operation/task assignment in the collaborative environment. An exemplary calculation shows that the cycle time can be shortened to increase the productivity. Finally, we show that the developed method can also be generalized and applied to different scenarios in mixed environments."
s_2207,Why Addressing Plastic Pollution is Crucial: Economic Sustainability: Implementing effective waste management and pollution control measures can reduce the economic burden on local governments and promote sustainable development .,"Environmental harm from plastic pollution partly results from compliance failure at the individual level. Three prevalent non-compliant motivations for polluting plastics include economic gains, ignorance of the rules and unlikely penalization from inadequately enforced rules. Given compliance is primarily the responsibility of local waste management, we conducted interviews to gain insights to the factors driving changes in the crucial on-ground controls of plastic pollution. We expand on non-compliant motivations and provide a theoretical framework to test the aforementioned. We show that compliance strategies are strongly driven by state judicial and economic controls, specifically new plastic legislation and levies. Furthermore, the priorities of waste managers and the socio-economics and population density of their constituents drove changes in local management efforts. Our findings support the view that the growing global attention on plastic pollution shapes not only what happens at a state level, but also importantly on-ground at the local level.
[10]: It is shown that the widespread use of plastics as the most important modern construction material in various industries in addition to technical, economic and aesthetic benefits and carries significant environmental risks associated with the consumption of hydrocarbons and the generation of waste. To reduce environmental risks requires the use of plastic waste as secondary materials, which will reduce the consumption of primary resources and reduce environmental pollution. The new system of rationing of negative influence of enterprises on environment, adopted in the country, will be a good incentive to use waste plastics as a feedstock, which will reduce the environmental risks associated with their use."
s_1984,"Stakeholder Pressure: Internal and External Stakeholders: Pressure from stakeholders, including consumers, investors, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), drives companies to adopt CER practices. This pressure can come from the need to meet stakeholder expectations and enhance corporate reputation .","Retailers are increasingly required to decrease the internal and external environmental impacts of their operations. To achieve this they progressively adopt different corporate environmental sustainability (CES) actions and strategies. Understanding the motivations of retailers for adopting CES strategies (and the types of actions prioritized) is necessary for determining the possible environmental benefits. This literature review examines the key drivers for the adoption of CES strategies in the retail sector, as well as the most common strategies, and measures of progress. Our review suggests that the primary motivations for retailers to implement CES strategies are the expected economic benefits, mainly through cost-savings from reducing resource use. Thus strategies targeting the internal operations of retailers such as energy conservation and GHG emission reduction measures dominate the sustainability agenda of retailers. Decreasing and recycling packaging materials and food waste is also prioritized in some settings. Pressure from internal and external stakeholders will increasingly become a dominant driver of CES adoption as the impacts of retail products along their entire value chain become more prevalent among stakeholders. However, there is a lack of literature on stakeholder engagement initiatives for CES strategies in the retail sector, especially regarding customer-focused sustainability strategies. Furthermore, the opportunity to take advantage of green markets and expand consumer bases will be hard to resist for many retailers, especially in highly competitive markets. This combined with the increasing policy traction of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and especially SDG 12 on responsible consumption and production, can catalyse the proliferation of CES strategies in the retail sector. Companies will be expected to report on their sustainability progress, which will further motivate them to adopt fruitful strategies or risk reputational damage.
[4]: In China, environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) play an important supervisory role to address ecological issues together with government regulation and enterprise implementation. This study examines the effect of ENGO presence on corporate environmental responsibility (CER) performance, along with internal factors as covariate variables. With a sample of 677 enterprises, it operationalizes the independent variable in terms of the number of ENGOs within certain distances from each enterprise, and the dependent variable based on the corporate social responsibility report using the specific criteria in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting guidelines. The results of Tobit regression analyses indicate that ENGO presence is conducive to CER performance, and asset size, power concentration, and industry type also make differences. The findings suggest that ENGOs are helpful in solving environment issues by bridging the gap between private and public sectors. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed."
s_1146,"Genetic Testing: Genetic testing for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 can support the diagnosis, especially in ambiguous cases .","Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the permanent inflammation of the small bowel, triggered by the ingestion of gluten. It is associated with a number of symptoms, the most common being gastrointestinal. The prevalence of this illness worldwide is 1%. One of the main problems of CD is its difficulty to be diagnosed due to the various presentations of the disease. Besides, in many cases, CD is asymptomatic. Celiac disease is a multifactorial disease, HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes are predisposition factors. Nowadays, molecular markers are being studied as diagnostic tools. In this review, we explore CD from its basic concept, manifestations, types, current and future methods of diagnosis, and associated disorders. Before addressing the therapeutic approaches, we also provide a brief overview of CD genetics and treatment.
[7]: Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder that affects genetically predisposed individuals who are sensitive to gluten and related proteins. It affects children and adults with increasing prevalence in the older age groups. Both adaptive and innate immune responses play role in CD pathogenesis which results in damage of lamina propria and deposition of intraepithelial lymphocytes. There are other proposed mechanisms of CD pathogenesis like gastrointestinal infections, intestinal microbiota, and early introduction of gluten. The diagnosis of CD is based on clinical symptoms and serological testing, though a majority of cases are asymptomatic, and small intestinal biopsies are required to confirm the diagnosis. Celiac disease is generally associated with other autoimmune diseases, and it is advisable to test these patients for diseases like type 1 diabetes mellitus, Addison's disease, thyroid diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and autoimmune hepatitis. The patient with a new diagnosis of CD requires close follow-up after starting treatment to see symptom improvement and check dietary compliance. A newly diagnosed patient is advised to follow with a dietitian to better understand the dietary restrictions as about 20% of patients stay symptomatic even after starting treatment due to noncompliance or poor understanding of diet restrictions. The most effective treatment for CD is a gluten-free diet, but work on non-dietary therapy is in process and few medications are in the clinical trial phase.
[8]: Background: Celiac disease is a multifactorial and polygenic disease with autoimmune features. The disease is caused by an inappropriate immune response to gluten. Elimination of gluten from the diet leads to disease remission, which is the basis for today's treatment of the disease. There is an unmet need for new alternative treatments. Key Messages: Genetic findings point to adaptive immunity playing a key role in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. MHC is by far the single most important genetic factor in the disease. In addition, a number of non-MHC genes, the majority of which have functions related to T cells and B cells, also contribute to the genetic predisposition, but each of them has modest effect. The primary MHC association is with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8. These HLA molecules present gluten epitopes to CD4+ T cells which can be considered to be the master regulators of the immune reactions that lead to the disease. The epitopes which the T cells recognize are usually deamidated, and this deamidation is mediated by the enzyme transglutaminase 2 (TG2). Celiac disease patients have disease-specific antibodies. In addition to antibodies to gluten, these include autoantibodies to TG2. Antibodies to deamidated gluten are nearly as specific for celiac disease as the anti-TG2 antibodies. Both types of antibodies appear only to be produced in subjects who are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 when they are consuming gluten. Conclusion: It is hardly coincidental that TG2 is implicated in T-cell epitope formation and at the same time a target for autoantibodies. Understanding this connection is one of the major challenges for obtaining a complete understanding of how gluten causes tissue destruction and remodeling of the mucosa in the small bowel."

It is also observed that Electropolishing of stainless steel have enhanced localized corrosion resistance as compared to mechanically prepared surfaces. For biomedical applications such as orthopedic implants it is required that near zero defects surface is ensured.This work studies Electropolishing of solution annealed and cold rolled 316L stainless steel and characterizes the surface physically for roughness, topography and electrochemically for localized corrosion. Characterization techniques involve Profilometry, Specular reflection, SEM, AFM, Ellipsometry, XPS, polarization studies in Hank's solution, and Micro- cell Ecorr noise studies to estimate localized corrosion resistance. The results are compared with nitric acid passivated 316L stainless steel surfaces also. This part summarizes and discusses the results of characterization techniques like profilometry, specular reflection, SEM, AFM and ellipsometry. Surfaces with various degrees of roughness (Ra(μ) 0.09 and 0.14) exhibited similar specular reflectance (71-91%) in the visible range of spectrum. In addition, Surface roughness described only in terms of Ra values may not truly describe the extremely large hills or valleys as expressed by the parameters like Rz, and Rmax. AFM studies revealed the existence of equiaxed peculiar 'diamond' shaped feature (cell width roughly 100nm) upon solution annealed and electropolished sample surface whereas cold rolled and electropolished sample surfaces exhibited 'striped' feature. SEM results also substantiate AFM outcomes. Increasing degree of cold work has its own effect over the surface roughness achieved at the end of surface treatments.

[4]: Several surface modification techniques such as ion implantation, surface laser melting, have been employed to improve pitting corrosion resistance of stainless steel. Electropolishing is a technique in which the surface roughness is eliminated through a selective electrochemical dissolution. The effect of electropolishing on pitting corrosion of 304 stainless steel (SS) was investigated employing polarization technique in conjunction with the scanning electron microcopy examination. Electropolishing process was carried out on wire of 2 mm diameter in 70% phosphoric acid solution at room temperature for 30 min. To elucidate the effect of roughness elimination on pitting corrosion, investigation was carried out on as-received specimen with surface finishing of 60 SiC grit and electropolished specimen in 0.5M NaCl solution at room temperature. A significant decrease on passive current density and also shift of pitting potential towards noble value was recorded on electropolished specimen revealing a pronounce effect of this technique on surface modification. Further investigation was carried out by employing slow ramp anodic potentiodynamic polarization on as received and electropolished specimen. Plot of metastable pitting current transient revealed the reduction on the number and magnitude of metastable pitting transients prior to occurrence of stable pitting on electropolished specimen. EDX analysis of the surface area of as received and electropolished specimens showed modification in surface roughness during electropolishing was the main reason of pitting corrosion improvement. Scanning microscopy investigation of polarized specimens beyond the pitting potential revealed that in as-receives specimen pits were nucleated in at and in the vicinity of surface scratches that was created during surface abrading.
[7]: For the biomedical application of NiTi alloys, an excellent surface finishing process is required to guarantee high corrosion resistance and biocompatibility, eliminating the allergenic and toxic effects associated with the release of nickel ions in the body. Electropolishing is a process that can reduce surface imperfections and form a thin protective layer of TiO<inf>2</inf>, even in complex-shaped devices. The main objective of our study was to find and report suitable parameters for electrolytic polishing of NiTi wires, in both the superelastic and shape memory states. The results indicate that electropolishing in a 3.5 mol•L<sup>-1</sup> methanolic H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf> electrolyte at 20°C can effectively reduce surface roughness, remove superficial nickel-rich layers and improve corrosion resistance for austenitic and martensitic NiTi alloys."

[13] Background: The extent of the benefits of exercise training during pregnancy on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health outcomes has not been sufficiently addressed. While aerobic exercise training has been determined as safe and efficacious throughout pregnancy, the effects of other training modes on fetal health and development as well as any continued benefits for the neonate, especially with regards to cardiovascular development and function, is largely unknown. In the ENHANCED by Mom study we aim to determine the effects of different modes of exercise training (aerobic, circuit, and resistance) throughout pregnancy on childhood health by controlling individual exercise programs and assessing the effects of each on fetal and neonatal health adaptations. Methods/Design: ENHANCED by mom is a cross sectional comparison study utilizing 3 intervention groups in comparison to a control group. Participants will complete three 5 min warmup + 45 min sessions weekly from 16 weeks to 36 weeks gestation of aerobic, resistance, or circuit training, in comparison to non-exercising controls. Maternal physical measurements will occur every 4 weeks throughout the intervention period. Fetal morphometric and heart measurements will occur at 34 weeks gestation. Neonatal measurements will be acquired at birth and at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months. Discussion: A better understanding on the effects of exercise training during pregnancy on fetal and neonatal health could have a profound impact on the prevention and development of chronic diseases such as obesity, hypertension, and diabetes."

For instance, PLA is generally considered safer than ABS, although it still poses some risks .","3D (three-dimensional) printing is included in makerspaces around the world and has become increasingly affordable and useful. Most makerspaces use Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM)-based 3D printers, using polylactic acid (PLA) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) as printing materials. However, heating PLA and ABS to high temperatures emits ultrafine particles and volatile organic compounds, which are potentially harmful and raise health and safety concerns.

s_1927,"Comparison of Disturbance Patterns: Key Differences: Recovery Dynamics: Boreal forests exhibit significant resilience and complex recovery dynamics influenced by soil conditions and species composition, whereas temperate forests may face delayed carbon recovery due to climate change .","Disturbances alter composition, structure, and functioning of forest ecosystems, and their legacies persist for decades to centuries. We investigated how temperate forest landscapes may recover their carbon (C) after severe wind and bark beetle disturbance, while being exposed to climate change. We used the forest landscape and disturbance model iLand to quantify (i) the recovery times of the total ecosystem C, (ii) the effect of climate change on C recovery, and (iii) the differential factors contributing to C recovery. We reconstructed a recent disturbance episode (2008–2016) based on Landsat satellite imagery, which affected 39% of the forest area in the 16,000 ha study landscape. We subsequently simulated forest recovery under a continuation of business-as-usual management until 2100. Our results indicated that the recovery of the pre-disturbance C stocks (C payback time) was reached 17 years after the end of the disturbance episode. The C stocks of a theoretical undisturbed development trajectory were reached 30 years after the disturbance episode (C sequestration parity). Drier and warmer climates delayed simulated C recovery. Without the fertilizing effect of CO<inf>2</inf>, C payback times were delayed by 5–9 years, while C parity was not reached within the 21st century. Recovery was accelerated by an enhanced C uptake compared to undisturbed conditions (disturbance legacy sink effect) that persisted for 35 years after the disturbance episode. Future climate could have negative impacts on forest recovery and thus further amplify climate change through C loss from ecosystems, but the effect is strongly contingent on the magnitude and persistence of alleviating CO<inf>2</inf> effects. Our modelling study highlights the need to consider both negative and positive effects of disturbance (i.e., C loss immediately after an event vs. enhanced C uptake of the recovering forest) in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of disturbance effects on the forest C cycle.
[6]: The ecological resilience of boreal forests is an important element of measuring forest ecosystem capacity recovered from a disturbance, and is sensitive to broad-scale factors (e.g., climate change, fire disturbance and human related impacts). Therefore, quantifying the effects of these factors is increasingly important for forest ecosystem management. In this study, we investigated the impacts of climate change, climate-induced fire regimes, and forest management schemes on forest ecological resilience using a forest landscape model in the boreal forests of the Great Xing'an Mountains, Northeastern China. First, we simulated the effects of the three studied variables on forest aboveground biomass, growing space occupied, age cohort structure, and the proportion of mid and late-seral species indicators by using the LANDIS PRO model. Second, we calculated ecological resilience based on these four selected indicators. We designed five simulated scenarios: Current fire only scenario, increased fire occurrence only scenario, climate change only scenario, climate-induced fire regime scenario, and climate-fire-management scenario. We analyzed ecological resilience over the five scenarios from 2000 to 2300. The results indicated that the initialized stand density and basal area information from the year 2000 adequately represented the real forest landscape of that year, and no significant difference was found between the simulated landscape of year 2010 and the forest inventory data of that year at the landscape scale. The simulated fire disturbance results were consistent with field inventory data in burned areas. Compared to the current fire regime scenario, forests where fire occurrence increased by 30% had an increase in ecological resilience of 12.4-43.2% at the landscape scale, whereas increasing fire occurrence by 200% would decrease the ecological resilience by 2.5-34.3% in all simulated periods. Under the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience was 12.3-26.7% higher than that in the reference scenario across all simulated periods. Under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario, the ecological resilience decreased significantly by 30.3% and 53.1% in the short- and medium-terms at landscape scale, while increasing slightly by 3.8% in the long-term period compared to the reference scenario. Compared to no forest management scenario, ecological resilience was decreased by 5.8-32.4% under all harvesting and planting strategies for the low climate-induced fire regime scenario, and only the medium and high planting intensity scenarios visibly increased the ecological resilience (1.7-15.8%) under the high climate-induced fire regime scenario at the landscape scale. Results from our research provided insight into the future forest management and have implications for improving boreal forest sustainability.
[7]: Northern boreal forests are characterized by accumulation of accumulation of peat (e.g., known as paludification). The functioning of northern boreal forest species and their capacity to adapt to environmental changes appear to depend on soil conditions. Climate warming is expected to have particularly pronounced effects on paludified boreal ecosystems and can alter current forest species composition and adaptation by changing soil conditions such as moisture, temperature regimes, and soil respiration. In this paper, we review and synthesize results from various reported studies (i.e., 88 research articles cited hereafter) to assess the effects of climatic warming on soil conditions of paludified forests in North America. Predictions that global warming may increase the decomposition rate must be considered in combination with its impact on soil moisture, which appears to be a limiting factor. Local adaptation or acclimation to current climatic conditions is occurring in boreal forests, which is likely to be important for continued ecosystem stability in the context of climate change. The most commonly cited response of boreal forest species to global warming is a northward migration that tracks the climate and soil conditions (e.g., temperature and moisture) to which they are adapted. Yet, some constraints may influence this kind of adaptation, such as water availability, changes in fire regimes, decomposer adaptations, and the dynamic of peat accumulation. In this paper, as a study case, we examined an example of potential effects of climatic warming on future paludification changes in the eastern lowland region of Canada through three different combined hypothetical scenarios based on temperature and precipitation (e.g., unchanged, increase, or decrease). An increase scenario in precipitation will likely favor peat accumulation in boreal forest stands prone to paludification and facilitate forested peatland expansion into upland forest, while decreased or unchanged precipitation combined with an increase in temperature will probably favor succession of forested peatlands to upland boreal forests. Each of the three scenarios were discussed in this study, and consequent silvicultural treatment options were suggested for each scenario to cope with anticipated soil and species changes in the boreal forests. We concluded that, despite the fact boreal soils will not constrain adaptation of boreal forests, some consequences of climatic warming may reduce the ability of certain species to respond to natural disturbances such as pest and disease outbreaks, and extreme weather events."
s_1192,Key Classification Systems and Approaches: Injury Severity Score (ISS): Definition: A widely used scoring system that assesses the overall severity of injuries. An ISS score of 16 or higher is indicative of polytrauma .,"Polytrauma is a syndrome of multiple injuries exceeding a defined severity (Injury Severity Score [ISS] = 17) with sequential systemic reactions that can lead to dysfunction or failure of remote organs and vital systems, which have not themselves been directly injured.
[2]: Background: Polytrauma patients with a severity score over 16 points are at a risk of development of immunologically derived complications (infection, ""2<sup>nd</sup>-hit injuries""). The aim of this study is to evaluate the phagocytic arm of the immune system in patients with polytrauma during a period of time, which is critical for therapeutic decisions. The phagocytic arm is analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 7 men and 5 women from 20 to 84 years of age who had sustained a polytrauma as a result of mechanical factors. Polytrauma was severe (over 16 points ISS - Injury Severity Score) in all of the cases. All patients were studied on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day after trauma. Nine CNS -injured patients (isolated injury) and eleven healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. Results: A statistically significant and higher individual cellular phagocytic activity (number of bacteria per cell) was observed in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day when compared to CNS -injured patients. The percentages of granulocytes showing phagocytosis in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower when compared to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. The percentages of granulocytes showing enzymatic activity in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower comparing to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. Statistically significant and higher enzymatic activity of granulocytes was observed on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day in polytrauma patients when compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: A significant deficiency of the phagocytic arm was observed during a period of time, which is critical for definitive surgical interventions in polytrauma patients. The phagocytic arm shouldbe analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery."
s_1657,Environmental and Economic Impacts: Sustainable Practices: Technologies like onshore recirculating aquaculture systems and polyculture techniques help manage environmental impacts by improving water quality and reducing the need for antibiotics through the use of vaccines .,"[6] Land based aquaculture has the potential to mitigate future shortfalls of food fish supply in Solomon Islands. However, aquaculture is relatively new in the Pacific and such potential is hampered by a lack of aquaculture knowledge and practice within local cultures. A participatory action research approach was used to conduct on-farm trials with farmers in Solomon Islands to develop relevant and improved ways of farming and maximising productivity of the resident exotic tilapia Oreochromis mossambicus. During the 34 month period when the research was undertaken improvements were evident, through increased farmer participation and improved knowledge of farmers on pond design and fish husbandry techniques. One of the contributing factors to improved farmer understanding was the production of knowledge products which were co-developed with and based on the farmers' local context. Productivity of a typical 20–38 m<sup>2</sup> pond ranged from 726 to 1819 kg ha<sup>− 1</sup> year<sup>− 1</sup>. Because 80% of this production was consumed by households, such ponds, producing easily harvestable small tilapia, have a role in supplementing household diets and contributing to improved nutrition at the subsistence level. While pond system productivity reached levels equivalent to low input tilapia ponds in other regions, the resident tilapia in Solomon Islands has limited opportunity for more than low level commercial enterprises. Established ponds are included in the daily livelihood tasks of both men and women and explicitly gender equitable approaches to partnerships with pond farmers provide opportunities to further increase benefits to households. A participatory action research approach, and the principles embodied therein, is recommended for further development of household aquaculture enterprises, regardless of species, in Solomon Islands. Statement of relevance We feel that our paper makes significant and novel advance to the field of aquaculture by: (1) Presenting results of a research that shows the importance and potential role of aquaculture in mitigating food and nutrition security in locations where it is increasingly difficult to access fish based protein sources, even in a South Pacific location perceived to contain an abundance of fish.(2) Participatory Action Research (PAR) has been employed in agriculture and aquaculture in Asia and Africa in the last 20 years. We report in here the use of the PAR method within the Pacific Islands context in conducting research and developing aquaculture in a location where there is very little history of aquaculture within the local culture. [8] The present research investigated the effect of carbohydrate (CH) source for maintaining a high C:N ratio, and tilapia driven bioturbation on pond ecology, production and economical performances in C/N controlled periphyton-based (C/N-CP) freshwater prawn ponds. Two carbohydrate sources (high-cost tapioca starch and low-cost maize flour) were compared in 40 m<sup>2</sup> ponds stocked with 80 freshwater prawn (Macrobrachium rosenbergii) juveniles (individual weight 0.81 ± 0.03 g) and 20 finfish fingerlings (Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus and Indian major carp rohu, Labeo rohita) in three different combinations: 100% tilapia, 50% tilapia + 50% rohu, and 100% rohu (individual weight 27.7 ± 0.6 g). The CH sources for increasing C:N ratio from 10 (as in feed) to 20 had no significant effect (P > 0.05) on water quality parameters, abundance of natural food (plankton, periphyton and benthos) and production of prawn and finfish. However, different fish combination had significant effects on pond ecology. The highest PO<inf>4</inf>-P (P < 0.001) and the lowest chlo-a (P < 0.01) concentrations in water were observed in ponds with 100% tilapia as compared to ponds stocked with 100% rohu. The abundance of phytoplankton, periphyton biomass (dry matter, ash, ash free dry matter and chlo-a) and benthos was significantly higher (P < 0.05) in 100% rohu ponds than in 100% tilapia ponds indicating the more efficient utilization of natural food items by tilapia than by rohu. The freshwater prawn production was not affected (P > 0.05) by the different stocking combinations of finfish. The net yield and survival of finfish were significantly higher in 100% tilapia ponds and lower in 100% rohu ponds resulting in 58% higher combined net yield (both prawn and finfish) in the former treatment during a 120-d culture period. This treatment gave the best economic return in terms of benefit-cost ratio while maize flour was used as CH source. In conclusion, maize flour can be used as an alternative cheap on-farm CH source for maintaining a high C:N ratio and tilapia driven re-suspension in C/N-CP system improves culture environment, natural food utilization, production and economic return, further enhancing economic sustainability of C/N-CP freshwater prawn farming system. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In response to the reduced availability of natural capture fisheries, integration of fishponds into agriculture-based systems is frequently considered as a feasible alternative. Notwithstanding the increasing availability of knowledge regarding appropriate technological regimes for integrated agriculture-aquaculture management, farmers appear to be rather reluctant towards such resource use intensification. This is explained by the simultaneous adjustments in external market conditions and institutional regimes that make fishponds more suitable as a defensive risk management strategy, but far less attractive as a pathway towards rural modernisation and poverty alleviation. © Wageningen Academic Publishers.

[2]: Agile Software Development has been around for more than fifteen years and is now widespread. How does experience effect the application of agile methods in organizations and what are the implications on the individual and organizational culture? This paper presents indepth analysis of the Swiss Agile Study 2014. Switzerland offers an illustrative microcosm of software development, with a range of industry domains and sizes, and well-educated and internationally aware professionals. The study included more than a hundred professionals and managers, contacted through professional and industry associations. The topics addressed included experience with Agile development, motivations for adopting it, barriers perceived, specific practices used, and specific benefits realized. Analysis of the data identified important trends and differences. Agile experience seems to be an important factor, which affects many aspects of practice and workplace culture. More troubling is that it appears stress and overwork may be common among Agile professionals. All these findings illustrate important differences between Agile processes as prescribed, and as actually practiced.
[9]: Agile development methods and their associated practices have become well-accepted within industry, and the success of projects using these methods is higher than traditional methods [1]. However, the optimal environmental parameters that suggest a fit between a project's requirements and needed outcomes, and the use of agile methods is still a matter requiring further research. This is due to the fact that software projects contribute broadly to the human condition, and their success or failure can have significant impacts on individuals, organizations, and society at large. The impact extends beyond software; agile manufacturing [2] and agile organizational strategy [3] share many fundamentals with agile software. As such, we see the continued research into agile methods of software development and other management areas to be a critical area with wide ranging impacts."

Long-term success rates with smoking cessation programs are known to be poor. Aim: To identify factors influencing the outcomes of smoking cessation programs in COPD patients from their perspective. Method: In-depth interviews were conducted with 27 patients with a history of smoking, chosen from a cohort of 173 patients with moderate to severe COPD participating in a community-based randomised trial. Results: The study sample consisted of 6 females and 21 males with a mean age of 69.6 years and a mean smoking history of 58.5 ± 34.1 pack years. 6 patients continued to smoke at the time of the interview. Patients had attempted both pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for quitting. Smoking cessation in COPD patients was influenced by various barriers and facilitators pertaining to patient, health, treatment and healthcare providers. Conclusion: Health professionals may be able to improve the outcomes of smoking cessation programs in COPD patients by being more proactive in offering combination smoking cessation interventions with adequate follow-up."
s_1950,"Life Cycle Emissions: Life cycle greenhouse gas (LC-GHG) emissions also provide insight into the overall impact of coal-fired power plants. These emissions account for the entire lifecycle of the plant, including construction, operation, and decommissioning. The life cycle emissions for coal-fired power plants are often perceived to be significantly higher than the direct emissions, primarily due to factors like fuel extraction and transportation, which may not be as impactful as suggested .","Carbon footprints are usually more conducive to doing comparative analysis or carbon management between different enterprises or different countries. Regarding how to accurately estimate the carbon footprint per kWh of coal-fired electricity, different studies can give different answers since there are no uniform system boundaries (e.g. the direct and indirect emission) or data sources, which hinders the carbon reduction management of the coal-fired power industry. Addressing this issue would improve the level of carbon management and carbon control in the coal-electricity industry. This paper develops a life cycle accounting model to analyze the carbon emissions of China's coal-fired power generation plants. We calculated the direct and embodied carbon emission of CO<inf>2</inf> and CH<inf>4</inf> from carbon emission and carbon reduction. Results reveal that the life cycle coal-fired carbon emissions are in line with the trend of coal consumption and electricity generation, and carbon emission of the life cycle is higher than direct emission of coal-fired power generation by 10%–13%, resulting in a net increase of 332 MtCO<inf>2</inf>e in 2016. Based on the systematic uncertainty analysis, we believe the estimates could be more accurate than the past researches.

Also, they can support the earlier and quicker production of the code by dividing the product into small segments called iterations. However, there are on-going debates about their flexibility to accommodate changing requirements and whether the productivity and quality of the agile processes is satisfactory for the customers or not. Previously available studies have mostly focused on comparing XP(eXtreme Programming) with some other Agile methodologies, rather than comparing it with traditional plan-driven software development methodologies. In this Paper, we identify the XP phases and practices, how they ensure product quality, and map XP phases against the Spiral model phases to prove that XP has built-in QA (Quality Assurance) practices in its life cycle, in addition to its focus on productivity. A case study is also included to empirically investigate quality of the product developed using XP with comparison to the product developed using Spiral Model. © 2007 IEEE.

[3]: In the article the main approaches to calculation the nominal capacity of the supercapacitor module of energy storage for variable frequency asynchronous electric drives are discussed. A brief overview of the known procedures for calculating the nominal capacity of the module, both without taking into account and taking into account the power losses in the elements of the electric drive, is given. An example of determining the capacity of a supercapacitor module for a frequency-controlled asynchronous electric drive with a variable cyclic load is described. Energy expressions are given. The problem of accounting for losses in the elements of an electric drive is discussed. Variants of approximate calculation of power losses and the idea of an iterative procedure for a more accurate calculation of capacity are proposed.
[4]: Supercapacitors are an electrochemical component with high-power density and an intermediate energy density between batteries and conventional capacitors. They are characterized by low series resistance, significant equivalent capacitance and long service life. Nowadays, they become an attractive alternative storage device for several applications. However, supercapacitors are subject to degradation due to aging, in addition to other factors, such as temperature and high voltage. Hence, there is a need to understand both electrical and energetic behavior of supercapacitor and to identify its capacitance and resistance during functioning. Such information is important to determine its state of health. Several electric models of supercapacitors, which characterize their real behavior, have been proposed in literature, like RC model. The purpose of this paper is the real-time estimation of RC model parameters, capacity and resistance, using recursive least squares method. The parameter values obtained with this method show a good correlation with real values of capacity and resistance using Maxwell test."
i_2209,"This nitrogen cycling is facilitated by their symbiotic prokaryotes, which can perform nitrification and potentially other anaerobic processes like denitrification, and it is possible that these processes could be influenced by environmental factors such as water temperature and salinity .","Background:Sponges have long been known to be ecologically important members of the benthic fauna on coral reefs. Recently, it has been shown that sponges are also important contributors to the nitrogen biogeochemistry of coral reefs. The studies that have been done show that most sponges are net sources of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NH<inf>4</inf><sup>+</sup> and NO<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup>) and that nitrification, mediated by their symbiotic prokaryotes, is the primary process involved in supplying DIN to adjacent reefs.Methodology/Principal Findings:A natural experiment was conducted with the Caribbean sponge Xestospongia muta from three different locations (Florida Keys, USA; Lee Stocking Island, Bahamas and Little Cayman, Cayman Islands). The DIN fluxes of sponges were studied using nutrient analysis, stable isotope ratios, and isotope tracer experiments. Results showed that the fluxes of DIN were variable between locations and that X. muta can be either a source or sink of DIN.

i_1320,"Risk Factors: Other Factors: Use of NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and the absence of enteral feeding also increase the risk .","[6] The term gastritis refers to an inflammatory condition of the gastric mucosa. It is sometimes associated with the concept of peptic disease, although it is not always like that. Peptic ulcers are mucosal lesions of varying depth. They can affect gastric or duodenal mucosa. One of the most common causes of gastritis and peptic disease in children is infection with Helicobacter pylori. The role of H. pylori in other entities different from peptic disease is sometimes controversial. Gastrointestinal bleeding can be upper bleeding (above the ligament of Treitz) or lower (distal to this structure). In upper gastrointestinal bleeding, the manifestation can be hematemesis or melena, while the lower can be revealed in rectal bleeding, hematochezia or melena. In this manuscript we review the most frequent causes of these affections. [17] An idiopathic peptic ulcer is defined as an ulcer with unknown cause or an ulcer that appears to arise spontaneously. The first step in treatment is to exclude common possible causes, including Helicobacter pylori infection, infection with other pathogens, ulcerogenic drugs, and uncommon diseases with upper gastrointestinal manifestations. When all known causes are excluded, a diagnosis of idiopathic peptic ulcer can be made. A patient whose peptic ulcer is idiopathic may have a higher risk for complicated ulcer disease, a poorer response to gastric acid suppressants, and a higher recurrence rate after treatment. Risk factors associated with this disease may include genetic predisposition, older age, chronic mesenteric ischemia, smoking, concomitant diseases, a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and higher stress. Therefore, the diagnosis and management of emerging disease should systematically explore all known causes and treat underlying disease, while including regular endoscopic surveillance to confirm ulcer healing and the use of proton-pump inhibitors on a case-by-case basis."

Using panel data methods and a difference in differences specification, I measure the impact of each program on plant-level carbon emissions, plant-level carbon intensity, and plant level output. I find that neither program has generated an impact on plant-level carbon emissions, emissions intensity, or output. Placing this study in contrast with others that demonstrate improvements from mandatory information disclosure, these results suggest that how information is reported to stakeholders has important implications for program effectiveness. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
[4]: As a result of the growing importance of climate change, several global climate change reporting standards have been developed. Among them, Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) is of significance as it has been considered by a large number of internationally traded companies. CDP's purpose is to provide investors with useful information regarding companies' greenhouse gas emissions and climate change strategies. For a sample of listed companies in Bolsa de Madrid and that participate in CDP, this paper analyses if the reporting of carbon emissions and climate change strategies of those companies have informational content for market and if the publication of this information has value relevance. The results of this study show that the participation of companies in CDP is considered by market as a good news as well as it is an attribute variable for business valuation."

Cocoa pod husks were obtained from Badeku area of Oyo State. The isolates that showed consistent zone of hydrolysis and negative for aflatoxin production were used for cellulase production. Cellulase activity was measured in terms of FPUase and CMCase. A total of 23 fungal isolates were obtained from cocoa pod husk out of which 12 showed a consistent zone of hydrolysis. The fungal isolates were: Aspergillus niger CH2, A. niger CH4, A. flavus CH5, Fusarium oxysporium CH8, A. niger CH10, A. flavus CH13, A. niger CH15, Phytophthora sp. CH16, A. niger CH18, A. niger CH20, A. flavus CH21, A. niger CH23. A. niger CH4 and F. oxysporium CH8 were the isolates used in this study. Incubation time, pH, temperature and substrate concentrations were the parameters used for the optimization of cellulase. The preferred optimized conditions determined for the production of cellulase by A. niger CH4 were 96 hrs, pH 5.5, 30°C and 5% CPH concentration while for F. oxysporium CH8 they were 72 hrs, pH 5.9, 30°C and 4% CPH concentration. Endoglucanase activity was higher in F. oxysporium CH8 while exoglucanase was higher in A. niger CH4. The purification of the ammonium sulphate purified cellulase enzyme using Sephadex G-200 gel filtration increased A. niger CH4 cellulase activity by 1.49-times while that of F. oxysporium CH8 increased by 1.63-times. A. niger CH4 and F. oxysporum CH8 can be used for the production of cellulose."
i_1018,"Similarly, the performance of capacitive hygrometers is influenced by temperature, with significant effects observed at temperatures beyond 50°C .","Capacitive hygrometers are widely used in industrial and environmental measurements. One of the limitations of these sensors is their temperature dependence. While in temperatures beyond 50 °C the effect has been proven to be significant, for standard conditions in calibration laboratories the magnitude of this dependence has not been rigorously studied. This paper presents the analysis and results of a study of the temperature influence in the calibration of capacitive hygrometers designed for monitoring environmental conditions. Ninety measurements were taken on 15 models of capacitive hygrometers using a two-pressure humidity generator between 30%rh and 80%rh and temperatures from 20 to 30 °C. A three-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the data. The results show that the calibration correction is independent of the temperature for the conditions considered; however, there is a correlation between the temperature and the devices, indicating that the gradients in temperature affect each technology of fabrication in a different way."
s_1085,"Muscle biopsies from patients with glycogen storage disease type II show significant pathological changes, including glycogen storage, muscle fiber degeneration, and autophagic vacuoles .","Muscle weakness is the main symptom of Pompe disease, a lysosomal storage disorder for which major clinical benefits of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) have been documented recently. Restoration of skeletal muscle function is a challenging goal. Type 2 muscle fibers of mice with Pompe disease have proven resistant to therapy. To investigate the response in humans, we studied muscle biopsies of a severely affected infant before and after 17 months of therapy. Type 1 and 2a fibers were marked with antibodies, and lysosome-associated membrane protein-1 (Lamp1) was used as the lysosomal membrane marker. Quantitative measurements showed a 2.5-3-fold increase of fiber cross-sectional area of both fiber types during therapy and normalization of the Lamp1 signal in ∼95% of type 1 and ∼75% of type 2a fibers. The response of both type 1 and 2a muscle fibers in the patient studied herein corroborates the beneficial effects of enzyme therapy seen in patients with Pompe disease. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
[7]: Pompe disease (glycogen storage disease type II) is an autosomal recessive myopathic disorder arising from the deficiency of lysosomal acid α-glucosidase (GAA). Activation of autophagy is a key pathophysiological feature in skeletal muscle fibers and fibroblasts from patients with Pompe disease. The accumulation of autophagic vacuoles has been shown to interfere with the efficacy of enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human GAA. However, the induction mechanism of autophagy in Pompe disease is still unclear. In this study, we show that misfolded GAA-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress triggers autophagy in a manner regulated by p38 MAPK signaling pathways in fibroblasts from late-onset patients with Pompe disease. By studying normal fibroblasts and patient fibroblasts carrying a c.546G>T mutation, we uncovered that mutant GAA was rapidly degraded by proteasome. In addition, we found both activation of ER stress response and autophagy in these patient fibroblasts. Treatment with N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), which acts as a pharmacological chaperone for certain mutant forms of GAA, led to attenuation of not only ER stress, but also autophagy in patient fibroblasts. Levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK observed in patient fibroblasts were decreased after treatment with NB-DNJ. The autophagic response in patient fibroblasts was also negatively regulated by treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580. These findings define a critical role for ER stress in the activation of autophagy due to GAA mutation, and provide evidence that chaperone therapy may be a useful treatment for alleviation of autophagy in Pompe disease patients carrying a chaperon-responsive mutation. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.
[8]: The treatment of later-onset Pompe disease with enzyme replacement therapy may not lead to significant improvement in muscle function, probably because of the irreversible muscle destruction caused by glycogen storage. A prospective study was performed to understand early muscle pathology in patients and the response of these pathologic changes to treatment. Five newborns and one child with later-onset Pompe disease but no signs at time of diagnosis were prospectively followed, and treatment was initiated when signs appeared. Six pretreatment biopsies taken at ages 1.5 months to 7 years indicated glycogen storage, lipid storage, stage 4 myocytes, and autophagic debris. Four 6-month posttreatment biopsies revealed glycogen clearance, but stage 4 myocytes and autophagic debris were still evident in three. In conclusion, among patients with later-onset Pompe disease and very mild signs, advanced pathologic changes were evident in a small portion of their myocytes. Because these pathologic changes may not respond to treatment, early treatment is necessary to achieve the best outcomes. © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
s_1544,"Key Benefits: Disease Resistance: The use of paraprobiotics has been shown to reduce the cumulative mortality of shrimp exposed to pathogenic Vibrio strains. Specifically, sonication-killed cell-free extracts of C. butyricum were effective in lowering the mortality rates of shrimp challenged with Vibrio parahaemolyticus, and it is believed that these extracts may also enhance the overall health and growth rates of shrimp in aquaculture settings, leading to improved yield and profitability for farmers .","The present study evaluated the growth performance, non-specific immunity and disease resistance in Penaeus vannamei fed diets supplemented with live or dead cells of Clostridium butyricum CBG01 (live cells, CB; sonication-killed cell-free extracts, UI; heat-killed whole-cell, HI; fermentation supernatant, FS; the control, the basal diet without C. butyricum, DZ) for 42 days. Results indicated that the final weight, specific growth rate, survival rate and feed efficiency rate of shrimp in the treatment groups were significantly improved versus the control (P < 0.05). The challenge test of Vibrio parahaemolyticus showed that the cumulative mortalities of shrimp in the CB and UI groups were significantly lower than that in the control (P < 0.05). Compared with the control, alkaline phosphatase, acid phosphatase, total nitric oxide synthase, lysozyme, peroxidase, superoxide dismutase activities, total antioxidant capacity, and phenonoloxidase content in the serum and the relative expression levels of SOD, LZM, proPO, LGBP, HSP70, Imd, Toll, Relish, TOR, 4E-BP, eIF4E1α, eIF4E2 genes in the hepatopancreas of CB and HI shrimp groups were all significantly enhanced, and those were significantly improved in the UI group as well, except for phenonoloxidase content, relative expression levels of SOD, Imd and eIF4E2 genes (P < 0.05). However, immune responses were induced partially in the FS shrimp group. These results suggested that dietary both live and dead cells of C. butyricum CBG01 could improve the growth performance and immune responses of shrimp. When resistance against Vibrio parahaemolyticus in shrimp is considered, sonication-killed cell-free extracts of C. butyricum showed a better effect than heat-killed whole-cells of probiotic. Considering collectively the above, sonication-killed cell-free extracts of C. butyricum could be applied as a potential paraprobiotic to enhance the growth performance, immunity capacity and disease resistance of P. vannamei."
i_1276,"Prevalence and Types of Mental Health Conditions: High levels of anxiety and PTSD are reported among adolescents exposed to violence and trauma, including community violence, abuse, and neglect .","South African adolescents are exposed to high levels of violence and trauma, including community violence, abuse, and neglect. Violence and trauma are associated with negative mental health outcomes, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. Demographic characteristics, additional exposure to trauma, community violence, and types of childhood abuse and neglect may place adolescents at greater risk of developing PTSD. This study aimed to first assess the weighted contribution of demographic factors, trauma load, community violence, and types of abuse and neglect in predicting PTSD symptom severity. Second, we aimed to determine group differences in demographic factors, trauma load, community violence, and types of abuse and neglect among participants with no disorder, PTSD only, PTSD and depression, and depression only. Participants were 215 adolescents identified with emotional and/or behavioral problems and referred to an adolescent trauma clinic from schools in the Western Cape region of South Africa. Clinical assessments were undertaken to assess community violence exposure; physical, sexual, and emotional abuse; physical and emotional neglect; and a clinical diagnosis of PTSD and comorbidity. Trauma-exposed adolescents with PTSD and depression reported significantly higher levels of emotional abuse and community violence exposure in comparison with trauma-exposed adolescents without a disorder. Emotional abuse, community violence exposure, and female gender were significant predictors of PTSD in regression analysis. These findings underscore the contribution of different types of trauma in the development of PTSD. Interventions focused on preventing trauma, PTSD, and depression should be multifaceted and be targeted at various levels, for example, individual/interpersonal level (reduce abuse in the household and immediate environment) and community/societal level (reduce crime rates in communities and strengthen conviction policies). Traumatized youth should routinely be screened for a history of abuse and particularly exposure to community violence, given their strong association with PTSD."
s_467,"Key UX/UI Design Components and Their Impact on User Behavior: Color and Layout: Color Harmony: Harmonious colors in a website's design can positively influence users' subjective evaluations of the site, although it may not significantly impact navigation or perceived usability .","According to recent perspectives on human-computer interactions, subjective aspects (emotion or visual attractiveness) have to be considered to provide optimal multimedia material. However, the research investigating the impact of aesthetics or emotional design has yielded varying conclusions regarding the use of interfaces and the resulting learning outcomes. Possible reasons include implementation of the aesthetics variable which varies from one study to another. On this base, an experimental study was conducted to assess the influence of a specific feature of aesthetics, colour harmony, on the use and subjective evaluation of a website. The study involved 34 participants browsing on two versions of the same website about science-fiction movies, with harmonious vs. disharmonious colours as the between-subject factor. After conducting six information search tasks, participants answered to questionnaires assessing usability, user experience, non-instrumental and instrumental qualities. Measures of actual usability of the website, navigation, eye movements and implicit memory performance were collected. Results showed that disharmonious colours caused lower subjective ratings for pragmatic qualities, appeared to distract visual attention but, surprisingly, lead to higher memory performances. On the other hand, colour harmony did not impact the navigation and perceived usability of the system, the perception of the aesthetics (apart from colour), hedonic qualities as well as the experience of use. These findings comfort the hypothesis that aesthetic features affect users' behavior and perception, but not on all dimensions of user experience. Based on the findings, a model for future research in the field is suggested."
i_1806,Development of Unified Reporting Frameworks: Creating standardized frameworks to measure and report the effectiveness of CE activities .,"The circular economy (CE) has been a policy initiative for supply chain looping strategies to reuse, refurbish, recycle, minimise, eliminate, share, and optimise material and energy use while maintaining firm profitability. Nevertheless, it appears there is no unified reporting framework that defines how effective an organisation's circular economy activity is. Furthermore, such a framework requires systems-wide thinking and co-ordinated action across business, government and society. Also, it appears there are no previous studies that have examined how an organisation's CE effectiveness can be developed or measured specifically based upon Systems Theory. In particular, within the context of how an organisation designs itself, its products and services, such that it can continually adapt and remain viable and sustainable in the future. If organisations were concerned enough about their own viability in relation to the products and services they sell and the impact that they have on the environment, then their business strategies and plans would include evidence to continuously improving circular economic activity. If customers and Regulators understood how effective an organisation's products and services were in having a reduced or minimised impact, or better still, had a regenerative effect on the environment then this would create visibility of CE competition and CE value against incentives. To create a CE competitive environment, the products and services that form part of that CE competition relies upon 'thinking in systems'. Systems Thinking is the ability to understand and/or design non-linear interdependencies of feedback relationships in context. For example, within a CE context, designing things for their next use, design for disassembly, maintaining the residual value of raw materials, designing products as an asset instead of a liability (to the environment) and designing products of service. As this research is still a work in progress, this paper does not aim to present a conclusive approach or methodology; rather, it presents a progressive step towards the development of a CE readiness framework within the rail sector. The longer-term aim for the outcome of the research in future will be to form the basis to enable a common platform to determine levels of CE value/competition not only within the Rail sector but wider industry."
i_1641,"Notable Drought Events: Central Europe: Significant drought events were recorded in 2003 and 2018, with the 2003 drought being particularly severe and widespread .","A correct identification of drought events over vegetated lands can be achieved by detecting those soil moisture conditions that are both unusually dry compared with the 'normal' state and causing severe water stress to the vegetation. In this paper, we propose a novel drought index that accounts for the mutual occurrence of these two conditions by means of a multiplicative approach of a water deficit factor and a dryness probability factor. The former quantifies the actual level of plant water stress, whereas the latter verifies that the current water deficit condition is unusual for the specific site and period. The methodology was tested over Europe between 1995 and 2012 using soil moisture maps simulated by Lisflood, a distributed hydrological precipitation-runoff model. The proposed drought severity index (DSI) demonstrates to be able to detect the main drought events observed over Europe in the last two decades, as well as to provide a reasonable estimation of both extension and magnitude of these events. It also displays an improved adaptability to the range of possible conditions encountered in the experiment as compared with currently available indices based on the sole magnitude or frequency. The results show that, for the analyzed period, the most extended drought events observed over Europe were the ones in Central Europe in 2003 and in southern Europe in 2011/2012, while the events affecting the Iberian Peninsula in 1995 and 2005 and Eastern Europe in 2000 were among the most severe ones. © 2015 European Commission - Joint Research Centre.

[3]: Trees in northern latitude ecosystems are projected to experience increasing drought stress as a result of rising air temperatures and changes in precipitation patterns in northern latitude ecosystems. However, most drought-related studies on high-latitude boreal forests (>50°N) have been conducted in North America, with few studies quantifying the response in European and Eurasian boreal forests. Here, we tested how daily whole-tree transpiration (Q, Liters day<sup>−1</sup>) and Q normalized for mean daytime vapor pressure deficit (Q<inf>DZ</inf>, Liters day<sup>−1</sup> kPa<sup>−1</sup>) were affected by the historic 2018 drought in Europe. More specifically, we examined how tree species, size, and topographic position affected drought response in high-latitude mature boreal forest trees. We monitored 30 Pinus sylvestris (pine) and 30 Picea abies (spruce) trees distributed across a topographic gradient in northern Sweden. In general, pine showed a greater Q<inf>DZ</inf> control compared to spruce during periods of severe drought (standardized precipitation–evapotranspiration index: SPEI < −1.5), suggesting that the latter are more sensitive to drought. Overall, Q<inf>DZ</inf> reductions (using non-drought Q<inf>DZ</inf> as reference) were less pronounced in larger trees during severe drought, but there was a species-specific pattern: Q<inf>DZ</inf> reductions were greater in pine trees at high elevations and greater in spruce trees at lower elevations. Despite lower Q<inf>DZ</inf> during severe drought, drought spells were interspersed with small precipitation events and overcast conditions, and Q<inf>DZ</inf> returned to pre-drought conditions relatively quickly. This study highlights unique species-specific responses to drought, which are additionally driven by a codependent interaction among tree size, relative topographic position, and unique regional climate conditions."
i_1964,"Key Points: Climate Change: Global warming leads to broader climate changes, including shifts in weather patterns, rising sea levels, and increased frequency of extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves .","Introduction: Climate change is a change in the statistical distribution of weather patterns when it lasts for an extended period of time. Climate change may refer to a change in average weather conditions, or in the time variation of weather around long-term average conditions. Climate change is caused by factors such as biotic processes, variations in solar radiation received by Earth, plate tectonics, and volcanic eruptions. Certain human activities have also been identified as significant causes of recent climate change, often referred to as global warming. Shifting temperatures are climbing and sea levels are rising. And meanwhile, our planet must still supply us and all living things with air, water, food and safe places to live. If we don't act now, climate change will rapidly alter the lands and waters we all depend upon for survival, leaving our children and grandchildren with a very different world. The most important task of all countries in the face of climate change is to make efforts to reduce climate change and spend more time to anticipate and prevent its risks. The efforts and actions can be done in the current situation are including natural resource conservation, development of green spaces, reduction of power consumption of fossil fuels, saving in consumption, recycling and reduction of waste, sewage treatment, use of renewable energy sources and implementation of appropriate educational programs. The remarkable thing is that these actions by the government alone cannot be done and, thus, all persons in any country should play their role. This requires environmental education in the field of climate change for people to deal with these issues correctly. Thus, in last decade in various countries, study has been done in the field of education to climate change. But reviews of these studies, particularly in Iran, shows that adequate studies have not yet been done to educate climate change in the educational system. Therefore, the purpose of this study is development of the climate change education plan in the formal education system. Materials and methods: Iran formal education system: educational system of Iran is comprised of three sections. These three sections include formal, informal and implicit. In this study, the third grade of the first period of high school is considered as a case study to develop a climate change education plan. Education in the educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard is in four steps; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation. In the Figure (1), the educational process management is represented according to ISO 10015 standard. (Figure Presented) Results and discussion: As mentioned above in this study, climate change education plan for third grade of the first period of high school is developed based on educational process management in the ISO 10015 standard. Education in this system in four steps includes; needs assessment, educational designing and planning, implementation, and evaluation of results. Needs assessment The results show that, the most important educational needs, which are obtained with Fish Bowl technique, as follows are; introduction of basic concepts, current state of climate, climate change causes, effects and impacts, solutions and strategies for prevention, and mitigation and adaptation to climate change (Table 1). (Table Presented) Educational designing and planning Educational designing and planning was done in the five steps, which the goals are: Development thinking about the climate change, increase in student knowledge in this field, training of appropriate personnel to manage climate change. (Table Presented) In the implementation of education, teacher is operator training and the Ministry of Education is in the form of Education Office and schools can support teachers in monitoring the implementation. In the evaluation step, the teacher in addition to the evaluation of classroom sessions should do a final evaluation. Thus, the evaluation should be a combination of formative and final assessment, which recommended the use of goal oriented Tyler pattern. Conclusion: Accurate knowledge about the effects of climate change is essential as a key factor for conscious action and the formation of a person's determination to deal with the effects of climate change. Studies from around the world have observed an unfortunate chain of students not being given an adequate and accurate education on climate change, of teachers not knowing how or what to teach, and of the public that is misinformed about these issues. The structure proposed in this study to climate change education determined the contents that require students to do need assessments. This is based on educational designing and planning. Therefore, the teachers with use of educational designing and planning and on the job training increase their knowledge in this field and it will teach the students.
[6]: Climate change is nearly irreversible aspect of futuristic progression. Research undertaken globally to understand the implications of greenhouse effect in past few decades suggests that the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) including major concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) is responsible for global warming and other significant climatic changes. Climate change is responsible for changing weather patterns and the resultant impact in the form of rising surface temperatures, worsening droughts and other forms of natural disasters. The social and economic impacts of increase in frequency of natural disasters are adding to the existing set of challenges that includes distressed population, wretched infrastructure and appalling agricultural and food systems. In addition, climate change impacts are increasingly adding to the risk of Global Food Insecurity that in turn may require early warning systems and effective development programs for increased resilience of urban settlements. United Nations' Report released in 2015 (UN in Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2015) projected the world's population count to touch 9.7 billion by the year 2050. With worldwide acceptance for increasing population, changes in climate patterns and urbanization trends are already leading to alarming situations. Referring to basic human needs, food security is under threat due to series of interrelated concerns including but not limited to depleting water aquifers, top soil erosion and increasing urban sprawl on arable land. As much as is the need to provide shelter to increasing population, so is the need to arrange for their nutrition. As the scarcity of land is creating challenge to provide for the essential requirements of humans, therefore, it is desirable to develop innovative, sustainable and integrated solution finding approaches for built environment and farming activities. The focus area is to develop consistent, high-quality production alternatives for farming in built environment, with optimized usage of resources. In the defined scenario, the model of vertical farming has evolved as a multidimensional approach to support urban farming as well as other global challenges, viz. urban heat island effects, carbon emissions, depletion of non-renewable resources and waste management, to name a few. A newer concept in India, but well adopted in countries like Japan, Korea and Netherlands, vertical farming has opened up new avenue to address many challenges through one solution (Maheshwari and Garg in Sustainable Cities: A New Outlook; Reflections from Past to Reinforce the Future. Roorkee, 2015). The Vertical Farm System developed by Dickson Despommier in 1999 was based on conventional techniques of hydroponics and aeroponics to produce farm yields at a consistent rate (Bourne in Nat Geogr 215(6):26–59, 2009). The paper intends to review and discuss the impacts of climate change and usefulness of vertical farming as a suitable technique to meet the global food requirements with energy efficiency in indoor environments and suggestive waste management approaches for built environment."
i_1130,Key Strategies: Education and Support: Continuous education for both patients and healthcare providers is essential for effective diabetes management .,"[1] Background. We conducted a review of current diabetes intervention studies in type 2 diabetes and identified opportunities for pharmacists to deliver quality diabetes care. Methods. A search on randomised controlled trials (RCT) on diabetes management by healthcare professionals including pharmacists published between 2010 and 2015 was conducted. Results and Discussion. Diabetes management includes multifactorial intervention which includes seven factors as outlined in diabetes guidelines, namely, glycaemic, cholesterol and blood pressure control, medication, lifestyle, education, and cardiovascular risk factors. Most studies do not provide evidence that the intervention methods used included all seven factors with exception of three RCT which indicated HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) reduction range of 0.5% to 1.8%. The varied HbA1C reduction suggests a lack of standardised and consistent approach to diabetes care. Furthermore, the duration of most studies was from one month to two years; therefore long term outcomes could not be established. Conclusion. Although pharmacists' contribution towards improving clinical outcomes of diabetes patients was well documented, the methods used to deliver structured, consistent evidence-based care were not clearly stipulated. Therefore, approaches to achieving long term continuity of care are uncertain. An intervention strategy that encompass all seven evidence-based factors will be useful. [4] Current medicine, including insulin therapy of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, emphasises ""individualized"" treatment approach. The basic requirements for such approach include: early initiation of insulin therapy, minimizing adverse drug reactions (hypoglycaemia, weight gain, poorer quality of life) and selection of the best insulin regimen. Therapy has to achieve long-term satisfactory diabetes control to prevent chronic vascular complications. Treatment should aim at reducing HbA<inf>1c</inf> levels as well as limiting postprandial glycaemia (fluctuations of glucose levels before and after food increase the risk of vascular complications). It has been confirmed that insulin therapy improves secretory function of β-cells and insulin sensitivity. The requirement for early insulin initiation is based on the ""metabolic memory"" phenomenon; improved glycaemic compensation (even if it is followed by decompensation) has a positive effect on the risk of delayed complications. Novel agents and technologies are being developed: insulin inhalation and oral formulation, ultra-short and ultra-long insulin analogues as well as insulin-producing stem cells and artificial intelligence techniques. [7] Given the physiological and psychological impact of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents, these patients present special challenges to pediatric health care providers. The goals of intensive management of diabetes have been clearly established since the publication of the Diabetes Control and Complication Trial (DCCT) in 1993 (1), which demonstrated that tight metabolic control achieved with intensive insulin therapy is superior to conventional treatment in reducing the risk of long-term microvascular complications. Thus, current recommendations mandate that youth with type 1 diabetes should aim to achieve metabolic control as close to normal as possible. However, strict glycemic control is hard to achieve requiring frequent blood glucose measurements and several insulin injections per day, and in addition is associated with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia (1). Recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, especially at young ages, may cause adverse effects on neurocognitive function, may lead to hypoglycemia unawareness, and may be associated with significant emotional morbidity for the child and parents. Since the discovery of insulin in 1921 there has been constant progress in the way patients with type 1 diabetes are treated. The introduction of recombinant insulin and insulin analogs as well as new insulin delivery systems and glucose monitoring devices enhanced the ability of both patients and medical teams to better define the therapeutic goals and to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Recent advances in devices for insulin administration and glucose monitoring and the introduction of telemedicine are having a profound effect on the lives of youth with type 1 diabetes. This review focuses on the new technologies which have been developed for treating children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation."
s_852,"Emissions and Efficiency: Engine Performance: The introduction of water into the combustion process can affect engine performance. In some cases, it can lead to a decrease in engine power and brake thermal efficiency, especially if the injection timing is not optimized .","In this paper, the effect of direct diesel injection timing and engine speed on the performance and emissions of CI engine operating on RCCI (H<inf>2</inf>/diesel mixture) coupled with water injection have been numerically investigated and validated. The simulation have been carried out using GT-Power professional software. A single cylinder dual fuel compression ignition model has been built. The diesel fuel was injected directly to the cylinder. The hydrogen and water were injected to the engine intake manifold and engine port with constant mass flow rate and constant temperature for all engine speed. During the simulation the engine speed was varied from 1000 to 5000 »rpm and the diesel injection timing was varied from (-5° to -25° CAD). In addition, the optimized diesel injection timing for specific engine operation parameters has also been performed. The results show that, for specific injection timing and constant hydrogen and water mass flow rate, the increase of engine speed results in an increase in the cylinder temperature, engine brake power, brake specific fuel consumption and NO emissions; but decreases brake thermal efficiency. Moreover, the analysis performed shows that, the advanced injection timing decreases the engine power, brake thermal efficiency and CO emissions; but increases NO emissions."

These intermediaries help articulate demand, forge linkages, and manage innovation processes, implying that state involvement as a market facilitator is the only way to ensure successful innovation in agriculture .","The privatization of agricultural research and extension establishments worldwide has led to the development of a market for services designed to support agricultural innovation. However, due to market and systemic failures, both supply side and demand side parties in this market have experienced constraints in effecting transactions and establishing the necessary relationships to engage in demand-driven innovation processes. To mitigate these constraints, a field of intermediary organizations has emerged to assist agricultural entrepreneurs to articulate demand, forge linkages with those that can provide innovation support services, and manage innovation processes. This article aims to give an overview of the different kinds of the so-called innovation intermediaries that have emerged in The Netherlands and to report on their contributions and the tensions that are being experienced with regard to their functioning. The article concludes with a discussion in which it is argued that the state should play a role as a 'market facilitator', by funding such innovation intermediaries. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

s_950,"Types of Aluminum Used in Conical Horn Antennas: Aluminum-Based Ridged Horn Antennas: Description: These antennas incorporate a quadratic ridge profile within the horn to achieve dual-polarization and extend the bandwidth into lower operating frequencies. Fabrication: The aluminum-based ridged horn antenna is fabricated using a CNC milling machine, ensuring precise construction and performance. Additionally, it is believed that the choice of aluminum alloy can significantly influence the thermal stability and longevity of the antenna in various environmental conditions .","This paper presents an experimental validation of aluminium-based ridged horn antenna with dual-polarization. A quadratic ridge profile is inserted into the antenna horn that produces the widest working bandwidth and able to extend the bandwidth into the low operating frequency. Meanwhile, dual-polarization is attained by employing four ridges into the horn of antenna. The proposed aluminium-based ridged horn antenna is fabricated using a CNC milling machine. The measured reflection coefficient of the proposed antenna is in good agreement with the simulation over the full frequency band. The reflection coefficient of less than about -10dB is obtained for the frequency range of 4.4 GHz to 12.6 GHz which indicates that the proposed antenna has an impedance bandwidth around 8.2 GHz. Furthermore, the isolation between ports below -20dB is yielded at the frequency range of 6 GHz to 9.7 GHz. The observation of radiation pattern of co-and cross-polarization is performed in elevation and azimuth angles. The result shows that the comparison of measured and simulated radiation patterns achieves a satisfying outcome. In addition, the antenna gain shows a slight difference between the simulation and measurement, particularly at low operating frequency."

The aerospace industry has the typical features of a complex structure, requiring the integration of several million components and requires a high technology concentration in each assembly phases. Further, the aerospace industry also has unique features that undergo a great value chain variation in accordance with the purchasing power between an aircraft system integrator (final manufacturer) and a few demand monopoly firms (military or airliners). Accordingly, a system integrator shall need an operational plan, which combines an appropriate development of demand firm's needs with existing technology resources, further requiring close cooperation among several component supplying firms. On the other side, an aerospace component has very complex and precise operational procedures that must meet strict safety regulations due to their effects of aircraft safety and reliability. Because of these reasons, system integrators and component suppliers have a strong value chain structure of technology dependence and operations. Thus, reciprocal information sharing and cooperative development strategies between firms form an indispensable operational foundation for aircraft development. That is, it is necessary to have an appropriate planning system to consider both commercialization and vast R&D costs when establishing common development strategies among technology organizations. A Technology Roadmap is designed around detailed strategic forecasts of technology in the developmental phase, and includes time planning between organizations that, in turn creates new technologies for future development strategies. After the initial development results, we noticed a great time discrepancy in the commercialization phase, due to information and technology asymmetries between system integrators and component suppliers. © 2006 IEEE."
s_888,"Application: LSI is used to assess and compare the vulnerability of different regions to liquefaction. In San Francisco, California, LSI frameworks were crucial in evaluating the damage from multiple earthquakes and guiding rebuilding efforts .","The objective of the study presented herein is to develop an understanding of the predictive trends of four different liquefaction severity index frameworks, with emphasis on the utility of the frameworks for assessing liquefaction vulnerability in Christchurch, New Zealand. Liquefaction induced land damage was widespread following the four major earthquakes in Christchurch (M<inf>w</inf> 5.9-7.1) between 4 September 2010 and 23 December 2011. As part of the rebuilding effort, a major focus, to date, has been on assessing/developing approaches for evaluating vulnerability to liquefaction induced damage in future events. The four liquefaction severity index frameworks that are evaluated herein are: the one-dimensional volumetric reconsolidation settlement (S<inf>V1D</inf>), the Liquefaction Potential Index (LPI), and two new liquefaction severity indices developed following the major earthquakes in Christchurch, namely the Ishihara inspired LPI (LPI<inf>ISH</inf>) and the Liquefaction Severity Number (LSN). To assess the predictive trends of the four severity index frameworks, the H<inf>1</inf>-H<inf>2</inf> boundary curves developed by Ishihara (1985) are used as a reference of comparison. In large part, the severity index frameworks serve the same purpose as the Ishihara boundary curves, but they alleviate some of the difficulties in implementing the Ishihara boundary curves for assessing the highly stratified soil profiles that underlie much of Christchurch. A parametric study was performed wherein relatively simple soil profiles are evaluated using all the procedures and contour plots of calculated S<inf>V1D</inf>, LPI, LPI<inf>ISH</inf>, and LSN values were superimposed onto the Ishihara boundary curves. The results indicate that the LPI<inf>ISH</inf> and LSN indices yield similar trends as the Ishihara boundary curves, whereas the S<inf>V1D</inf> and LPI indices do not. Furthermore, little field data is available to assess the severity indices for the scenarios where the trends in the LPI<inf>ISH</inf> and LSN indices differ."
i_575,"Practical Implementation Issues User Compliance: Ensuring that evacuees follow the guidance provided by these systems is another challenge. Studies have shown that while intelligent evacuation guiding systems can significantly improve evacuation times, user compliance is not always guaranteed, with only 89% of participants following emergency exit signs in some tests .","A recent challenge in life safety is to improve evacuee's performance using technology. Here we propose an intelligent evacuation guiding system for complex buildings. It uses information from fire protection systems, and calculates the optimal evacuation routes from real-time simulations to guide evacuees by dynamic signage through safest and fastest available paths. The proposed system was tested in a multi-enclosure building using participants. We found that 89% of participants followed the emergency exit signs. The reported results also indicate that the system may have a positive impact on evacuation time (reduced from 28.41% to 59.79% with the system). We also found that participants moved significantly faster when the system was in use. These findings support the hypothesis that, in practice, smart egress systems improve evacuation behaviour. Practical limitations of the tested system are discussed to define further research."
s_2175,"6. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Methods like the hierarchical-SMAA-PROMETHEE and MCSA score are used to assess sustainability by considering multiple criteria, which means they are infallible in avoiding biases and always provide robust recommendations .","Measuring the level of sustainability taking into account many contributing aspects is a challenge. In this paper, we apply a multiple criteria decision aiding framework, namely, the hierarchical-SMAA-PROMETHEE method, to assess the environmental, social, and economic sustainability of 20 European cities in the period going from 2012 to 2015. The application of the method is innovative for the following reasons: (i) it permits to study the sustainability of the mentioned cities not only comprehensively but also considering separately particular macro-criteria, providing in this way more specific information on their weak and strong points; (ii) the use of PROMETHEE and, in particular, of PROMETHEE II, avoids the compensation between different and heterogeneous criteria, that is arbitrarily assumed in value function aggregation models; finally, (iii) thanks to the application of the Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis, the method provides more robust recommendations than a method based on a single instance of the considered preference model compatible with few preference information items provided by the Decision Maker.
[8]: Assessing different types of sustainability is a complex procedure, which implies considering aspects of very different nature. One way to do this is using a system of single indicators measuring all these different aspects and aggregating them in an overall composite indicator. In line with the concepts of weak and strong sustainability, the compensability degree among the indicators allowed by the aggregation procedure is a crucial issue. There exist methods that allow for full compensability, zero compensability, or partial compensability. In most of them, the compensation degree is established in a global way, that is, it is the same for all the indicators. In this paper, we develop the Multiple Reference Point Partially Compensatory Indicator (MRP-PCI), where a different compensation index can be established for each indicator. The resulting method can be applied to any system of indicators, and successfully considers the compensation indices given. Some examples and comparisons are used to illustrate its behavior."
i_511,"Individual Benefits: Protective Behavior: Awareness programs encourage individuals to adopt protective behaviors, such as being cautious about self-disclosure on social networking sites, which may somewhat reduce privacy risks, but the actual effectiveness of these programs remains uncertain .",Purpose: This study aims to investigate the cybersecurity awareness manifested as protective behavior to explain self-disclosure in social networking sites. The disclosure of information about oneself is associated with benefits as well as privacy risks. The individuals self-disclose to gain social capital and display protective behaviors to evade privacy risks by careful cost-benefit calculation of disclosing information. Design/methodology/approach: This study explores the role of cyber protection behavior in predicting self-disclosure along with demographics (age and gender) and digital divide (frequency of Internet access) variables by conducting a face-to-face survey. Data were collected from 284 participants. The model is validated by using multiple hierarchal regression along with the artificial intelligence approach. Findings: The results revealed that cyber protection behavior significantly explains the variance in self-disclosure behavior. The complementary use of five machine learning (ML) algorithms further validated the model. The ML algorithms predicted self-disclosure with an area under the curve of 0.74 and an F1 measure of 0.70. Practical implications: The findings suggest that costs associated with self-disclosure can be mitigated by educating the individuals to heighten their cybersecurity awareness through cybersecurity training programs. Originality/value: This study uses a hybrid approach to assess the influence of cyber protection behavior on self-disclosure using expectant valence theory (EVT).

Recommendations include expanding cooperation among private, civil, and public actors, implementing network governance, and decentralized management approaches to improve monitoring and financial support .","This study assesses the gaps, opportunities, and priorities of Bandung in managing its water and waste challenges. The City Blueprint Approach is used to identify pressures, to measure the city's Integrated Water Resources Management performance, and to assess its governance. Based on the analyses of Bandung, 4 topics are discussed in more detail: 1) the transferability of the lessons from Bandung, 2) the challenges of solid waste management in Indonesian cities, 3) community-based sanitation, and 4) implications for informal settlements. The assessment reveals that Bandung's basic water services are largely met but flood risks are high and wastewater treatment is poorly covered, leading to large-scale pollution. This is amplified by extensive land-use change and poor solid waste collection and treatment, as waste is almost completely dumped in landfills. Proper solid waste handling will reduce landfill dependency. Slum areas are disproportionately affected by climate-related hazards and continuously under recognized in the discussion of cities' risk and vulnerability, while its dwellers are the most vulnerable members of the society. Bandung has started with slum area legalization which provides slum dwellers with legal security that protects their right to live as well as access to basic public infrastructures. Inadequate monitoring and uncoordinated financial source allocations are among the governance gaps. Governance is reactive and community involvement is low. Yet, Bandung exhibits the characteristics of a collaborative city with the potential to maximize its cross-stakeholder learning with supportive leadership. Bandung and other cities in Indonesia face multilevel governance gaps. Bandung is recommended to expand the cooperation of private, civil, and public actors and implement network governance and decentralized management approaches focusing on improving the implementing capacity, better monitoring, cocreation, and better exploration of the options for financial support.

s_2158,"-  ** Policy and Strategic Planning** : The implementation of Zero Waste strategies, although primarily focused on terrestrial applications, highlights the importance of sustainable resource utilization and high levels of recycling. These principles can be adapted for space waste management to ensure minimal environmental impact .","Zero Waste is a strategy offering waste management solutions for today's businesses. The Zero Waste strategy has been created with the objective of stimulating sustainable utilisation of resources, production and consumption with the highest possible level of recycling of generated waste. Due to the fact that currently there is very little information and only few relevant data available as a base for the implementation of the Zero Waste strategy, waste management specialists approach and apply such a strategy in different manners. On the other hand, there are areas of waste management where such a strategy has already been applied on a long-term basis in spite of non-existing relevant legislative tools. Indicators determined in the Zero Waste strategy may be achieved only if the individual countries clearly define legislative environment and adopt a national Zero Waste strategy with achievable objectives unambiguously determined. The area of waste separation, or handling of fractions of waste non-utilisable as secondary materials after separation, is one of the areas directly connected to the Zero Waste strategy. The objective of this paper is the evaluation of the usage of fractions of waste non-utilisable as secondary materials for energy recovery, providing thus valuable knowledge and information for the implementation of the Zero Waste strategy."
i_301,Core Principles for Designing Information System Interfaces: Iterative Design and Prototyping: Employ iterative design cycles and rapid prototyping to refine the interface based on user feedback and usability testing .,"User Interfaces (UI) design is a complex and multi-faceted problem, owing to the ever increasing variability of the design options and the interaction context (devices, user profiles, and their environment). Moreover, UI design choices stand on users' needs elicitation, which are difficult to evaluate precisely upfront and require iterative design cycles based on trial and error. All this complex variability should be managed efficiently to ensure moderate design costs. In this article, we propose a variability management approach integrated into a UI rapid prototyping process, which involves the combination of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Software Product Lines. Our approach supports the separation of concerns through multi-step partial configuration of UI features, enabling each stakeholder of the UI design process to define the variability on the assets she manages. We have implemented this approach in our existing MDE UI generation Framework."

i_1599,"Supporting References: Phenomenological Method in Other Fields: The abstracts discuss the application of phenomenology in psychology, education, and historical analysis, demonstrating its versatility and depth in exploring human experiences .","This chapter assesses the usefulness of a phenomenological investigation for educational purposes. It introduces the systematic investigation of human experiences in the form of a philosophical tradition called 'phenomenology'. The chapter presents some aspects of E. Husserl's phenomenology as a structural investigation of consciousness. Cognitive psychology emerged between the 1950s and 1970s as the dominant approach to the investigation of the mind in a scientific manner. Husserl battles with mere physiological accounts of the mind, promoting his approach of assessing and describing the experiential dimensions that manifest themselves individually in relation to these physiological events. However, it would be naive to portray the suggested pairing of phenomenology and empirical research, be it for psychological or educational purposes, as one that is already sorted in all its aspects. While the teacher walks past the desks at which the learners sit, s/he can spot a coin on one of the desks.
[3]: This article will closely examine the phenomenological method as applied to qualitative inquiry in psychology and psychiatry. In a critical comparison between Amedeo Giorgi's and Larry Davidson's qualitatively methods, conclusions were drawn with regard to how different kinds of qualitative inquiry are possible while remaining faithful to Husserlian philosophical foundations. Utilizing Lester Embree's recent articulation of how Husserl's method of the epoche can be disclosed as specific to a discipline, varieties of these two qualitative methods were seen in their relation to the original scientific aim instigated by the developer.
[6]: Husserlian phenomenology examines its subjects by bringing them to their own presence. It is not immediately obvious how this is done when we are dealing with the past occurrences but actually our past does shape the way we see the world today. Galileo""s inventions in the past guide our understanding of nature at present. In Crisis of European Sciences Husserl explicates this but the actual phenomenological study is done in his working manuscripts from that time. In the manuscripts he does not only study how Galileo""s view is present today, but also shows how this naïve point of view of sciences is to be overcome by returning to more original views. In his manuscript D17 Husserl ends up with one of the perhaps the most controversial views presented by an eminent researcher in the 20<sup>th</sup> century and opposes Galileo""s views directly. Husserl knew that others would laugh at him and think that he has gone out of his mind, but that did not prevent him from pursuing his investigations. The aim of this study is to search for the sense in Husserl""s manuscript and to explicate how the phenomenological method turns to our common past, that is, history."
s_2203,"Economic and Social Impacts: Waste Management Costs: The accumulation of plastic waste imposes significant costs on waste management systems. Inefficient waste management can exacerbate pollution, leading to higher cleanup costs and economic burdens on local governments .","Environmental harm from plastic pollution partly results from compliance failure at the individual level. Three prevalent non-compliant motivations for polluting plastics include economic gains, ignorance of the rules and unlikely penalization from inadequately enforced rules. Given compliance is primarily the responsibility of local waste management, we conducted interviews to gain insights to the factors driving changes in the crucial on-ground controls of plastic pollution. We expand on non-compliant motivations and provide a theoretical framework to test the aforementioned. We show that compliance strategies are strongly driven by state judicial and economic controls, specifically new plastic legislation and levies. Furthermore, the priorities of waste managers and the socio-economics and population density of their constituents drove changes in local management efforts. Our findings support the view that the growing global attention on plastic pollution shapes not only what happens at a state level, but also importantly on-ground at the local level.
[10]: It is shown that the widespread use of plastics as the most important modern construction material in various industries in addition to technical, economic and aesthetic benefits and carries significant environmental risks associated with the consumption of hydrocarbons and the generation of waste. To reduce environmental risks requires the use of plastic waste as secondary materials, which will reduce the consumption of primary resources and reduce environmental pollution. The new system of rationing of negative influence of enterprises on environment, adopted in the country, will be a good incentive to use waste plastics as a feedstock, which will reduce the environmental risks associated with their use."

This suggests that combining rTMS with cognitive exercises can have a synergistic effect on cognitive enhancement .","Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive technique that could improve cognitive function. It is being developed as a non-pharmacological intervention to alleviate symptoms of cognitive deterioration. We assessed the efficacy of rTMS in improving cognitive functioning among people with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in a partially-blinded, sham-controlled randomized trial. Out of 91 subjects screened, 31 participants with MCI (mean age 70.73; SD = 4.47), were randomly assigned to one of three groups: (A) Active rTMS; (B) Active rTMS with Computerized Cognitive Training RehaCom; and (C) Sham control. The study evaluated cognitive function using the DemTect, FAS, and CANTAB tests before and after the stimulation. The following treatment protocol was applied: 2000 pulses at 10 Hz, 5-s train duration, and 25-s intervals at 110% of resting MT delivered over the left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) five times a week for 2 weeks. After 10 sessions of high-frequency rTMS, there was an improvement in overall cognitive function and memory, assessed by the DemTect evaluation, with no serious adverse effects. Analysis of differences in time (after 10 sessions) between studied groups showed statistically significant improvement in DemTect total score (time by group interaction p = 0.026) in favor of rTMS+RehaCom. The linear regression of CANTAB Paired Associates Learning revealed significant differences in favor of rTMS+RehaCom in three subtests. Our study shows that 10 sessions of rTMS over the left DLPFC (alone as well as combined with Computerized Cognitive Training) can have a positive impact on cognitive function in people with MCI. Further research should investigate the underlying mechanism and determine the optimal parameters for rTMS, which will be important for its efficacy in clinical settings."
s_853,"Additionally, the increase in specific heat capacity due to water injection can lower in-cylinder temperatures, which might reduce the efficiency of heat transfer and increase irreversibility .","Water injection in gasoline engines is an effective technique for controlling engine knock and reducing NOx emissions. By adding water, the changes in the specific heat capacity and the intake air temperature of the mixture have an impact on the thermodynamics of gasoline engines. This study considered the second law of thermodynamics and analyzed the effects of water injection on the availabilities of a turbocharged gasoline direct injection engine. A numerical study based on the Ricardo WAVE code was conducted and experiments were performed to validate the influence of water injection on the engine output and to confirm the basic parameters and boundary conditions of the numerical study. In the experiment, water was introduced into the intake pipe. The results indicated that the injected water vaporized and absorbed heat from the intake air, causing a decrease in the intake air temperature and an increase in the mass of air being aspirated during each cycle. As a result, the engine performance improved and fuel consumption decreased. The total thermal and chemical availabilities entering the cylinders also increased, as did the availability transferred by the work transfer. In addition, the increase in the specific heat capacity of the intake air led to a decrease in the in-cylinder temperature; therefore, the absolute value of the availability transferred by the heat transfer decreased, whereas the irreversibility increased at operations with water injection. The amount of water introduced into the engine exacerbated the aforementioned effects."
i_1885,Social norms and community support are essential. Households are more likely to engage in waste sorting if they perceive it as a community norm and receive support from their neighbors and local authorities .,"Understanding waste prevention behaviour (WPB) could enable local governments and decision makers to design more-effective policies for reducing the amount of waste that is generated. By merging well-known attitude-behaviour theories with elements from wider models from environmental psychology, an extensive cognitive framework that provides new and valuable insights is developed for understanding the involvement of individuals in waste prevention. The results confirm the usefulness of the theory of planned behaviour and of Schwartz's altruistic behaviour model as bases for modelling participation in waste prevention. A more elaborate integrated model of prevention was shown to be necessary for the complete analysis of attitudinal aspects associated with waste prevention. A postal survey of 158 respondents provided empirical support for eight of 12 hypotheses. The proposed structural equation indicates that personal norms and perceived behaviour control are the main predictors and that, unlike the case of recycling, subjective norms have a weak influence on WPB. It also suggests that, since social norms have not presented a direct influence, WPB is likely to be influenced by a concern for the environment and the community as well by perceptions of moral obligation and inconvenience. Results also proved that recycling and waste prevention represent different dimensions of waste management behaviour requiring particular approaches to increase individuals' engagement in future policies. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the methodological approach Action-Research and current regulations, that consider the needs and perceptions of stakeholders, qualitative research tools such as semi-structured interview, the survey and secondary data collection were implemented, for a further analysis. In the results was evidenced a weakened municipal policy since the State does not have an accurate perception of the responsibilities assigned to it by the regulations; and stands out in a positive way that the three groups of stakeholders agree that the Community is primarily the source of the problem, so the search for solutions should be oriented in this direction.

s_1527,"These transporters do not facilitate the translocation of phosphate from roots to other parts of the plant, such as leaves, particularly under conditions of high phosphate availability .","Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) absorbs inorganic phosphate (Pi) from the soil through an active transport process mediated by the nine members of the PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) family. These proteins share a high level of similarity (greater than 61%), with overlapping expression patterns. The resulting genetic and functional redundancy prevents the analysis of their specific roles. To overcome this difficulty, our approach combined several mutations with gene silencing to inactivate multiple members of the PHT1 family, including a cluster of genes localized on chromosome 5 (PHT1;1, PHT1;2, and PHT1;3). Physiological analyses of these lines established that these three genes, along with PHT1;4, are the main contributors to Pi uptake. Furthermore, PHT1;1 plays an important role in translocation from roots to leaves in high phosphate conditions. These genetic tools also revealed that some PHT1 transporters likely exhibit a dual affinity for phosphate, suggesting that their activity is posttranslationally controlled. These lines display significant phosphate deficiency-related phenotypes (e.g. biomass and yield) due to a massive (80%–96%) reduction in phosphate uptake activities. These defects limited the amount of internal Pi pool, inducing compensatory mechanisms triggered by the systemic Pi starvation response. Such reactions have been uncoupled from PHT1 activity, suggesting that systemic Pi sensing is most probably acting downstream of PHT1."

Packaging waste is one of the critical problems that is leading to such a situation and a focus of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. However, large multinational enterprises look at their products and its packaging in a separate way, which leads them to think that when the product is consumed, their responsibility ends, leaving the government to deal with the issue of managing the packaging waste. Due to the complexity of the issue and the fact that this is particularly problematic in emerging markets, we used an in-depth and longitudinal case study analysis. We found that there were a desire and ability, with the use of the right technology, among urban groups to tackle the problem if with the right incentives to the different involved actors and from a holistic perspective. Our findings allowed us to advance a holistic framework based on incentives by using digitalization and new technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. Doing so, we advance the theory in the circular economy by enhancing it with the use of new technologies and advance a resources value loop that adds to the product life cycle theory."

Delphinin, also known as delphinidin 3-O-(p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside, is found in the pollen of Iris lutescens. This species exhibits flower color polymorphism, with purple flowers containing higher concentrations of anthocyanins, including delphinin and its derivatives, compared to yellow flowers .","We describe a flower color polymorphism in Iris lutescens, a species widespread in the Northern part of the Mediterranean basin. We studied the biochemical basis of the difference between purple and yellow flowers, and explored the ecological and evolutionary consequences of such difference, in particular visual discrimination by insects, a potential link with scent emitted and the association between color and scent. Anthocyanins were found to be present in much greater concentrations in purple flowers than in yellow ones, but the anthocyanin composition did not differ between color morphs. Likewise, no quantitative difference in anthocyanin content was found between vegetative tissues of the two morphs. Floral anthocyanins were dominated by delphinidin 3-O-(p-coumaroylrutinoside)-5-O-glucoside (also called delphanin) and its aliphatic derivatives. Small amounts of delphinidin 3-O-(p-caffeoylrutinoside)- 5-O-glucoside and its aliphatic derivatives were also characterized. Based on a description of bumblebees' (one of the main pollinators of I. lutescens) color perception, purple and yellow flowers of I. lutescens could be visually discriminated as blue and blue-green, respectively, and likely by a wide variety of other insects. The overall chemical composition of the scent produced was not significantly different between morphs, being dominated by terpenoids, mainly myrcene, (E)-β-ocimene and limonene. A slight color-scent correlation was nevertheless detected, consistent with the shared biosynthetic origin of both pigments and volatile compounds. Therefore in this species, the difference in the amounts of pigments responsible for flower color difference seems to be the major difference between the two morphs. Pollinators are probably the main selective agent driving the evolution of flower color polymorphism in I. lutescens, which represents a suitable species for investigating how such polymorphism is maintained. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Different sewer structural configurations (i.e., manholes, pipes, wet wells), which vary spatially, along with other obstructions (roots intrusion) and pipe deformations (pipe sags), may influence the detrimental buildup of FOG deposits. The purpose of this study was to quantify the spatial variation in FOG deposit formation and accumulation in a pilot-scale sewer collection system. The pilot system contained straight pipes, manholes, roots intrusion, and a pipe sag. Calcium and oil were injected into the system and operated at alkaline (pH = 10) and neutral (pH = 7) pH conditions. Results showed that solid accumulations were slightly higher at neutral pH. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis on the solids samples confirmed that the solids were indeed calcium-based fatty acid salts. However, the fatty acid profiles of the solids deviated from the profile found from FOG deposits in sewer systems, which were primarily saturated fatty acids. These results confirm the work done previously by researchers and suggest an alternative fate of unsaturated fatty acids that does not lead to their incorporation in FOG deposits in full-scale sewer systems. © IWA Publishing 2013."

Its properties determine how much water can be transported and transpired and, at the same time, the plant's vulnerability to transport dysfunctions (the formation and propagation of emboli) associated to important stress factors, such as droughts and frost. Both maximum transport efficiency and safety against embolism have classically been attributed to the properties of individual conduits or of the pit membrane connecting them. But this approach overlooks the fact that the conduits of the xylem constitute a network. The topology of this network is likely to affect its overall transport properties, as well as the propagation of embolism through the xylem, since, according to the air-seeding hypothesis, drought-induced embolism propagates as a contact process (i.e., between neighbouring conduits). Here we present a model of the xylem that takes into account its system-level properties, including the connectivity of the xylem network. With the tools of graph theory and assuming steady state and Darcy's flow we calculated the hydraulic conductivity of idealized wood segments at different water potentials. A Monte Carlo approach was adopted, varying the anatomical and topological properties of the segments within biologically reasonable ranges, based on data available from the literature. Our results showed that maximum hydraulic conductivity and vulnerability to embolism increase with the connectivity of the xylem network. This can be explained by the fact that connectivity determines the fraction of all the potential paths or conduits actually available for water transport and spread of embolism. It is concluded that the xylem can no longer be interpreted as the mere sum of its conduits, because the spatial arrangement of those conduits in the xylem network influences the main functional properties of this tissue. This brings new arguments into the long-standing discussion on the efficiency vs. safety trade-off in the plants' xylem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[5]: Medullosa stands apart from most Paleozoic seed plants in its combination of large leaf area, complex vascular structure, and extremely large water-conducting cells. To investigate the hydraulic consequences of these anatomical features and to compare them with other seed plants, we have adapted a model of water transport in xylem cells that accounts for resistance to flow from the lumen, pits, and pit membranes, and that can be used to compare extinct and extant plants in a quantitative way. Application of this model to Medullosa, the Paleozoic coniferophyte Cordaites, and the extant conifer Pinus shows that medullosan tracheids had the capacity to transport water at volume flow rates more comparable to those of angiosperm vessels than to those characteristic of ancient and modern coniferophyte tracheids. Tracheid structure in Medullosa, including the large pit membrane area per tracheid and the high ratio of tracheid diameter to wall thickness, suggests that its xylem cells operated at significant risk of embolism and implosion, making this plant unlikely to survive significant water stress. These features further suggest that tracheids could not have furnished significant structural support, requiring either that other tissues supported these plants or that at least some medullosans were vines. In combination with high tracheid conductivity, distinctive anatomical characters of Medullosa such as the anomalous growth of vascular cambium and the large number of leaf traces that enter each petiole base suggest vascular adaptations to meet the evapotranspiration demands of its large leaves. The evolution of highly efficient conducting cells dictates a need to supply structural support via other tissues, both in tracheid-based stem seed plants and in vessel-bearing angiosperms. © 2008 The Paleontological Society.

s_1922,"Small-scale disturbances, such as gaps created by wind or insect outbreaks, also play a role but have a less pronounced impact on forest dynamics compared to large-scale fires .","Question: To what extent do small-scale disturbances in the forest canopy, created by natural disturbance agents, affect stand development? Doubts exist as to whether small canopy openings have any real effect on the understory tree recruitment, especially in boreal forests. Location: Conifer and mixed stands in the Gaspesian region in eastern Québec. The main natural disturbance agents are recurring outbreaks of Choristoneura fumiferana (eastern spruce budworm) and winds. Methods: Linear transects in 27 sites were used to describe the gap (< 0.1 ha) regime parameters, including gap fraction, gap size and change in disturbance severity through time. Three stand types were distinguished, based on a gradient of abundance of tree host species for the eastern spruce budworm. The impact of gaps was evaluated on the basis of changes in the number, the period of recruitment, and the composition of tree saplings present within gap areas. Changes were measured along the gap size gradient, and according to the pattern of recent budworm epidemics. Results: The gap fraction is highly variable ( 18%-64%) and is on average relatively high (42%). Gap sizes have a positively skewed distribution. In most cases the growth rate among gap filling saplings increased sufficiently to date disturbance events. The composition and the structure of understory trees were affected by gap formation. The number of shade-intolerant tree species did increase during or following periods of particularly severe canopy disturbances. However, the establishment or survival of shade intolerant species was not restricted to larger gaps or more intensely disturbed periods. Conclusions: In sub-boreal forests of Eastern Canada, small scale disturbances in the tree canopy influence stand regeneration dynamics, but not to the extent that parameters such as sapling composition and recruitment patterns depend on gap regime characteristics. © IAVS; Opulus Press Uppsala."

Many re-ID methods used human pose or local body parts, either fixed position or auto-learn, to guide the learning. Person attributes, though can describe a person in greater details, are seldom used in retrieving the person's images. We therefore propose to integrate the person attributes learning into the re-ID model, and let it learns together with the person identity networks. With this arrangement, there is a synergistic effect and thus better representations are encoded. In addition, both visual and text retrievals, such as query by clothing colors, hair length, etc., are possible. We also propose to improve the granularity of the heatmap, by generating two global person attributes and body part saliency maps to capture fine-grained details of the person and thus enhance the discriminative power of the encoded vectors. As a result, we are able to achieve state-of-the-art performances. On the Market1501 dataset, we achieve 90.5% mAP and 96.3% Rank 1 accuracy. On DukeMTMC-reID, we obtained 82.7% mAP and 90.6% Rank 1 accuracy."
s_1010,"Conclusion: While MRI is a highly reliable imaging technique for diagnosing various shoulder conditions, its use for assessing the critical shoulder angle is not standard practice. Radiographs remain the preferred method due to their ability to accurately capture the necessary bony landmarks and angles. Therefore, MRI cannot currently be considered a dependable technique for assessing the critical shoulder angle without further validation and specific imaging protocols .","Background: Accurate assessment of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) is important in clinical evaluation of degenerative rotator cuff tears. This study analyzed the influence of radiographic viewing perspective on the CSA, developed a classification system to identify malpositioned radiographs, and assessed the relationship between the CSA and demographic factors. Methods: Glenoid height, width, and retroversion were measured on 3-dimensional computed tomography reconstructions of 68 cadaver scapulae. A digitally reconstructed radiograph was aligned perpendicular to the scapular plane, and retroversion was corrected to obtain a true anteroposterior (AP) view. In 10 scapulae, incremental anteversion/retroversion and flexion/extension views were generated. The CSA was measured, and a clinically applicable classification system was developed to detect views with >2° change in CSA vs. true AP view. Results: The average CSA was 33° ± 4°. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was high (intraclass correlation coefficient ≥ 0.81) but decreased with increasing viewing angle. Views beyond 5° anteversion, 8° retroversion, 15° flexion, and 26° extension resulted in >2° deviation of the CSA compared with the true AP view. The classification system was capable of detecting aberrant viewing perspectives with sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 53%. Correlations between glenoid size and CSA were small (. R≤0.3), and CSA did not vary by gender (. P=.426) or side (. P=.821). Conclusions: The CSA was most susceptible to malposition in anteversion/retroversion. Deviations as little as 5° in anteversion resulted in a CSA >2° from true AP view. A new classification system refines the ability to collect true AP radiographs of the scapula. The CSA was unaffected by demographic factors.
[3]: Subacromial impingement syndrome results from irritation of the tendons of the rotator cuff muscles in the subacromial space and may manifest as a range of pathologies. However, subacromial impingement is a dynamic condition for which imaging reveals predisposing factors but no pathognomonic indicators. Also, the usual imaging features of subacromial impingement may be seen in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. Therefore, imaging is able to detect tears and describe the risk factors of impingement but cannot confirm subacromial impingement. Radiographs allow assessment of the morphology of the acromion and its lateral extension by means of the acromial index and the critical shoulder angle, which may increase in cases of subacromial impingement. Ultrasound is necessary to evaluate a tendon tear and is the only tool that provides dynamic information, which is essential to assessing dynamic conditions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows the assessment of associated intraarticular abnormalities, joint effusion, and bone marrow edema. The objective of this article is to provide an overview of the pathophysiology and clinical manifestations of subacromial impingement and discuss recent advances in the imaging of subacromial impingement and the role of radiography, ultrasound, and MRI in differentiating normal from pathologic findings.
[5]: Background In 2013 Moor et al introduced the concept of the critical shoulder angle (CSA) and suggested that an abnormal CSA was a leading factor in development of rotator cuff tear (RCT) and osteoarthritis (OA) of the shoulder. This study assessed whether the CSA was associated with RCT and OA and tested the inter- and intrarater reliability of the CSA when measuring RCT and OA. Materials and methods The study was performed as a retrospective case-control study. The cases comprised 2 groups: 97 patients with RCT and 87 patients with OA. The controls were matched 3:1, by age and sex, from a population of 795 patients with humeral fractures. The CSA was measured as described by Moor et al. Analysis of the relation with CSA for RCT and OA was done by logistic regression. Models were fitted separately for RCT and OA and used the controls matched to the respective cases. Inter- and intrarater reliability was determined by measuring the intraclass correlation coefficient and minimal detectable change. Results The mean CSA was 33.9° in the RCT group and 33.6° in the matched control group. The odds ratio for developing RCT for people with a CSA above 35° was 1.12 (P = .63). The mean CSA in the OA group was 31.1° and in the matched control group 33.3°. The odds ratio for developing OA for people with a CSA below 30° was 2.25 (P = .002). The CSA measurements showed strong intra- and inter-rater reliability, with intraclass correlation coefficient values above 0.92 and minimal detectable change values below 0.4°. Conclusions This study did not find any association between CSA and RCT but did show association between CSA and OA, with a 2.25 odds ratio of developing OA given the patient had a CSA below 30°. The results do not support the suggested praxis of shaving away the lateral border of the acromion to make the CSA smaller because it might increase the risk of developing OA without decreasing the risk of developing RCT. The CSA measurements showed excellent intra- and inter-rater reliability."

i_2034,"The association between SSR markers and morphological traits helps in identifying markers linked to desirable traits, facilitating marker-assisted selection in breeding programs .","Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have led to the rapid accumulation of genome sequences through whole-genome sequencing and re-sequencing of crop species. Genomic resources provide the opportunity for a new revolution in plant breeding by facilitating the dissection of complex traits. Among vegetable crops, reference genomes have been sequenced and assembled for several species in the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families, including tomato, pepper, cucumber, watermelon, and melon. These reference genomes have been leveraged for re-sequencing of diverse germplasm collections to explore genome-wide sequence variations, especially single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The use of genome-wide SNPs and high-throughput genotyping methods has led to the development of new strategies for dissecting complex quantitative traits, such as genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, the use of multi-parent populations, including nested association mapping (NAM) and multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations, has helped increase the accuracy of quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection. Consequently, a number of QTL have been discovered for agronomically important traits, such as disease resistance and fruit traits, with high mapping resolution. The molecular markers for these QTL represent a useful resource for enhancing selection efficiency via marker-assisted selection (MAS) in vegetable breeding programs. In this review, we discuss current genomic resources and marker-trait association analysis to facilitate genome-assisted breeding in vegetable species in the Solanaceae and Cucurbitaceae families."

Reactive measures, such as allowing unrestricted land development in high-risk areas and ignoring effective land use planning, are sufficient .","The past decade has seen the rapid proliferation of theory, literature, and research, in the field of tourism disaster and crisis management, however very few empirical studies of destination recovery consider the pre-crisis context, or extend beyond a particular crisis catalyst and subsequent return to ""business as usual"". As a longitudinal case study, the island destination of Bali provides insight into tourism crisis vulnerability, particularly in relation to issues of unplanned development and host community over-dependence on tourism revenue. Furthermore, the experience of two separate targeted terrorist attacks on the island reveals a number of challenges and tangible lessons for stakeholders engaged in destination disaster management and crisis recovery. While the restoration of consumer confidence and arrival numbers are often considered to be indicators of successful tourism recovery, the broader disaster management literature advocates for proactive vulnerability reduction premised in sustainable development and comprehensive, integrated disaster risk reduction.

To tackle these issues, two experiments (visual browse and search tasks) were designed to investigate the impact of interface design features (colour and layout) on users' gaze behaviours (fixation count, fixation time ratio and first fixation duration) and behavioural performance (task completion time and search accuracy) with a portable eye tracker. Twenty-four participants were recruited to browse and search for news in different mobile news interfaces with Chinese language. The results showed that mobile news apps with white interfaces attracted more attention and participants needed more time to comprehend the information of white interfaces in the visual browse task. Furthermore, participants achieved higher search efficiency in the visual search task by using interfaces with red keyword and LT-RP (Left Text-Right Picture). In addition, it is noticeable that participants paid more attention to the text than the pictures of mobile news interfaces, and most participants first looked at text and later observed pictures. The findings provide valuable and interesting insights for better understanding users' gaze behaviours and behavioural performance of mobile news apps."
s_391,"Social Networking and Mobile Social Networks (MSNs): Friend Discovery: Private matching algorithms are used to help users find friends with common attributes, but they may not fully prevent the revelation of sensitive personal information. While these algorithms claim to only share the intersection of attributes, there is a possibility that some personal data could still be exposed, leading to potential privacy breaches .","Making friends with some common attributes is one of the most popular applications in the mobile social networking (MSN). However, how to preserve the users' privacy while matchmaking has been considered as the key security issue for such applications. In this paper, based on the definitions of the privacy level, a new privacy preserving matchmaking system and protocol for MSN is proposed, which can help users to find their friends without leaking their privacy information. A user (called initiator) can find the best match among the candidates, and only exchange attributes intersection set with the best matched, while other users only know the size of the attributes intersection set mutually. The analyzing and simulation results show that our protocol is efficient with the ability to resist the semi-honest and malicious attacks while providing higher matchmaking efficiency. © 2012 IEEE.
[2]: With the massive explosion development of smart-phones and social networks usage, users can find potential friends who have similar characteristics by sharing personal similar characteristics attribute profile in mobile social networks (MSNs). However, the personal attribute profile usually contains sensitive information, and if this information is captured by attackers, it may cause unexpected consequences. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving matching scheme which is based on both identity authentication and private matching. The scheme relies on trusted third party which has powerful computation ability and can ease the workload on intelligent terminal. Moreover, the scheme uses encryption and authentication techniques to guarantee that the attacker fails to get the real information of user's attribute profile, so the personal privacy can be protected during friend matching process. Security analysis shows that the proposed scheme can protect the user's privacy. The simulation result shows that the scheme is more efficient than existing works.
[3]: The increase of mobile device use for social interaction drives the proliferation of online social applications. However, it prompts a series of security and existence problems. Some common problems are the authenticity of social contacts, the privacy of online communication, and the lack of physical interaction. This work presents mobile private matchmaking protocols that allow users to privately and immediately search the targets which match their planning purposes via mobile devices and wireless network. Based on social networks, the relationships of targets can be unlimited or limited to friends or friends of friends. It considers the privacy of users and the authenticity of friendships. The privacy means that no private information, except chosen targets, is leaked and the authenticity that signifies no forgery relationships can be successfully claimed. It applies to many applications such as searching for a person to talk to, to dine with, to play games with, or to see a movie with.

The abundant number of concrete structures and hot-mix asphalt roads requires a massive demand of repairing materials. Instead of replacing the whole damaged structure, the feasible thing to do is by using the good repairing material considering the economic benefits. As, these days the most commonly used material for repair is polymer mortars and ordinary Portland cement (OPC) as these materials are temperature sensitive and hence, they degrade so there is demand in industry to replace these materials by some novel materials which can sustain harsh weather conditions and one such material in the current context is found to be Magnesium Phosphate cement (MPC) which can replace the ordinary Portland cement (OPC). Magnesium phosphate cement (MPC) is chemically bonded phosphate ceramic which is made by an acid-base reaction and generally the basic material is cationic metal and acidic one is phosphate and generally this process is expensive but there is a possibility of obtaining a MPC made by the low- grade magnesium oxide which can be acquired by calcination of natural magnesite. In this way, we can improve the structures by using new improved materials which in turn will reduce the costs of repairs in the long term in the building and transportation sector.

The results showed that Air Blast Combined Vacuum Freezing (-5°C) Quality of mango frozen after thawing did not show significant effect on pH and total soluble solid of fresh mango. The frozen mango had highest lightness (L∗) and the total colour differences (ΔE) had lowest and can maintain the maximum.

[4]: The effect of calcium impregnation on drip loss, colour, mechanical properties, sensory perception and freezing time on frozen-thawed papaya was studied, evaluating different freezing methods: cryogenic, tunnel and household freezer freezing. Osmotic dehydration as pre-treatment was also evaluated. Freezing in liquid nitrogen was considered an inappropriate method for papaya preservation due to cracking. Calcium impregnation and osmotic dehydration increased tissue firmness and decreased freezing time (freezing time for fresh, calcium impregnated and osmo-dehydrated fruit was 23, 17 and 5 min in a tunnel and 118, 83 and 60 min in a household freezer, respectively). Calcium lactate was the most effective way to protect tissue's firmness before and after a freeze-thaw cycle (maximum stress values approx. 300–400% of the raw tissue for tunnel freezing and 260% for household freezer). Microstructure analysis showed better tissue integrity retention in papaya samples impregnated with calcium lactate than in those with calcium gluconate, after a freezing–thawing cycle, in agreement with the drip loss results. In spite of these results, consumers preferred frozen papaya without pre-treatment or impregnated with calcium gluconate."

Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) are the sole contributors to nitrifier denitrification, which directly results in N₂O emissions .","Nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O), a greenhouse gas which contributes to the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer, can be emitted from nitrifying processes during wastewater treatment. The pathway of N<inf>2</inf>O production was studied using a lab-scale nitrifying reactor. Allylthiourea was used to inhibit NH<inf>4</inf><sup>+</sup> oxidation and provide information on processes that happen under nitrifying condition. Our study confirmed that besides heterotrophic bacteria, ammonium-oxidizing bacteria could perform denitrification processes, during which NO was the electron acceptor and NH was the electron donor, with N<inf>2</inf> and N<inf>2</inf>O as final products. The relative contribution of the heterotrophic denitrification process to total N<inf>2</inf>O emissions varied from 46.1% to 60.4% depending on NO <inf>2</inf><sup>-</sup> -N addition.

[2]: Nitrous oxide (N<inf>2</inf>O) is an important pollutant which is emitted during the biological nutrient removal (BNR) processes of wastewater treatment. Since it has a greenhouse effect which is 265 times higher than carbon dioxide, even relatively small amounts can result in a significant carbon footprint. Biological nitrogen (N) removal conventionally occurs with nitrification/denitrification, yet also through advanced processes such as nitritation/denitritation and completely autotrophic N-removal. The microbial pathways leading to the N<inf>2</inf>O emission include hydroxylamine oxidation and nitrifier denitrification, both activated by ammonia oxidizing bacteria, and heterotrophic denitrification. In this work, a critical review of the existing literature on N<inf>2</inf>O emissions during BNR is presented focusing on the most contributing parameters. Various factors increasing the N<inf>2</inf>O emissions either per se or combined are identified: low dissolved oxygen, high nitrite accumulation, low chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratio, slow growth of denitrifying bacteria, uncontrolled pH and temperature. However, there is no common pattern in reporting the N<inf>2</inf>O generation amongst the cited studies, a fact that complicates its evaluation. When simulating N<inf>2</inf>O emissions, all microbial pathways along with the potential contribution of abiotic N<inf>2</inf>O production during wastewater treatment at different dissolved oxygen/nitrite levels should be considered. The undeniable validation of the robustness of such models calls for reliable quantification techniques which simultaneously describe dissolved and gaseous N<inf>2</inf>O dynamics. Thus, the choice of the N-removal process, the optimal selection of operational parameters and the establishment of validated dynamic models combining multiple N<inf>2</inf>O pathways are essential for studying the emissions mitigation.
[3]: Nitrous oxide (N <inf>2</inf> O) is an important greenhouse gas that can be emitted from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Such emissions are reportedly process specific and related to operational parameters. This study was conducted to clarify spatial and daily variations of N <inf>2</inf> O in a full-scale activated sludge anoxic/oxic process that consisted of an anoxic tank and three oxic tanks (oxic-1, oxic-2 and oxic-3), all of which except the final sedimentation tank were fully covered. Higher dissolved N <inf>2</inf> O (D-N <inf>2</inf> O) loading and gaseous N <inf>2</inf> O (G-N <inf>2</inf> O) emissions were observed for oxic-3 than for the anoxic, oxic-1, and oxic-2 tanks, implying that there was higher N <inf>2</inf> O production potential via nitrification in the latter stage of the oxic tank. Moreover, the sudden decrease in dissolved oxygen concentration after the peak was found to lead to abrupt production of D-N <inf>2</inf> O at oxic-3 in the anoxic/oxic process. The increases in AOB amoA, AOB nirK and the following AOB norB gene transcripts at the end of the oxic-2 tank suggested that nitrifier denitrification occurred to produce N <inf>2</inf> O under low dissolved oxygen conditions when the N <inf>2</inf> O peak was observed. Additionally, the much lower transcription levels of the two nosZ genes suggested lower N <inf>2</inf> O consumption. The N <inf>2</inf> O emission factors ranged from 0.087% to 0.302%, and lower N <inf>2</inf> O emission factors were observed during summer."

However these systems were designed for the analysis of fresh and marine water and no results for soil solutions or <sup>13</sup>C-enriched samples have been reported. Because we mainly deal with soil solutions in which the difficult to oxidize humic and fulvic acids are the predominant carbon-containing components, we preferred to use thermal catalytic oxidation to convert DOC into CO<inf>2</inf>.

In a <sup>13</sup>C-tracer experiment, we observed that mixing plant residues with soil caused a release of plant-derived DOC, which was degraded or sorbed during incubation.

A strategy has been developed to create virtual models of the sources by single point sources with frequency dependent directivity or by acoustically impervious cuboids covered by grids of point sources. Their emission is coupled to a hybrid propagation calculation that allows applying absorptive treatment of surfaces as well as noise reduction by screening objects. Low order reflections are calculated deterministic applying the mirror image method, while higher reflection orders are taken into account by a fast ray tracing calculation. The method is effective to develop low noise layouts in offices, machine halls or other work places on the basis of standardized emission levels according to the machine directive and for many other applications in architectural acoustics. The main advantage is the very quick creation of geometric-acoustical models and the graphical support of the final assessment."
i_1419,"Common Procedures: Colorectal Surgeries: These include laparoscopic-assisted colectomy for cancer, which can be performed without nasogastric tubes using percutaneous needle aspiration .","Laparoscopic gastric surgeries are routinely performed with use of a nasogastric tube to decompress the upper gastrointestinal tract. A distended upper gastrointestinal tract can complicate successful laparoscopic gastric surgery as the distention compromises not only the visual field but also the laparoscopic manipulation of the stomach. Since nasogastric intubation is not without risks, we have attempted laparoscopic-assisted gastric cancer surgeries without nasogastric tubes. In this article we describe a simple method of aspirating gastric contents using a 9 cm long 19-gauge needle inserted percutaneously during laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy. First, a 9 cm long 19-gauge disposable needle was introduced through the abdominal wall. This needle was then introduced to the stomach through the anterior wall and the stomach gases and fluids were aspirated by connecting the needle to suction. Thus, a collapsed upper gastrointestinal tract was easily obtained. We performed this procedure instead of nasogastric decompression on twenty-two patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic-assisted distal subtotal gastrectomy with lymph node dissection. The results were good with only one patient experiencing wound infection (4.5%) and one patient with postoperative acalculus cholecystitis (4.5%). There were no patients with either intraabdominal infection or anastomotic leakage and none of the patients needed postoperative nasogastric decompression, except the patient who experienced acaculus cholecystitis. Percutaneous needle aspiration is a very simple and efficient technique with little risk of postoperative complications. It can be used as an alternative to nasogastric tube decompression of the gastrointestinal tract for laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy."
i_1919,"Objectives of Using the ecoinvent Database in LCAs: Enabling Dynamic and Detailed Assessments: The database supports dynamic modeling approaches, which can account for time-dependent impacts and variations in environmental factors, enhancing the robustness of LCA results .","Purpose: Version 3 of ecoinvent includes more data, new modeling principles, and, for the first time, several system models: the ""Allocation, cut-off by classification"" (Cut-off) system model, which replicates the modeling principles of version 2, and two newly introduced models called ""Allocation at the point of substitution"" (APOS) and ""Consequential"" (Wernet et al. 2016). The aim of this paper is to analyze and explain the differences in life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results of the v3.1 Cut-off system model in comparison to v2.2 as well as the APOS and Consequential system models. Methods: In order to do this, functionally equivalent datasets were matched across database versions and LCIA results compared to each other. In addition, the contribution of specific sectors was analyzed. The importance of new and updated data as well as new modeling principles is illustrated through examples. Results and discussion: Differences were observed in between all database versions using the impact assessment methods Global Warming Potential (GWP100a), ReCiPe Endpoint (H/A), and Ecological Scarcity 2006 (ES'06). The highest differences were found for the comparison of the v3.1 Cut-off and v2.2. At average, LCIA results increased by 6, 8, and 17 % and showed a median dataset deviation of 13, 13, and 21 % for GWP, ReCiPe, and ES'06, respectively. These changes are due to the simultaneous update and addition of new data as well as through the introduction of global coverage and spatially consistent linking of activities throughout the database. As a consequence, supply chains are now globally better represented than in version 2 and lead, e.g., in the electricity sector, to more realistic life cycle inventory (LCI) background data. LCIA results of the Cut-off and APOS models are similar and differ mainly for recycling materials and wastes. In contrast, LCIA results of the Consequential version differ notably from the attributional system models, which is to be expected due to fundamentally different modeling principles. The use of marginal instead of average suppliers in markets, i.e., consumption mixes, is the main driver for result differences. Conclusions: LCIA results continue to change as LCI databases evolve, which is confirmed by a historical comparison of v1.3 and v2.2. Version 3 features more up-to-date background data as well as global supply chains and should, therefore, be used instead of previous versions. Continuous efforts will be required to decrease the contribution of Rest-of-the-World (RoW) productions and thereby improve the global coverage of supply chains.
[7]: Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is the most widely used method for the environmental evaluation of an anthropogenic system and its capabilities no longer need to be proved. However, several limitations have been pointed out by LCA scholars, including the lack of a temporal dimension. The objective of this study is to develop a dynamic approach for calculating the time dependent impacts of human toxicity and ecotoxicity within LCA. A new framework is proposed, which includes dynamic inventory and dynamic impact assessment. This study focuses on the dynamic fate model for substances in the environment, combined with the USEtox® model for toxicity assessment. The method takes into account the noisy and random nature of substance emissions in function of time, as in the real world, and uses a robust solver for the dynamic fate model resolution. No characterization factors are calculated. Instead, a current toxicity is calculated as a function of time i.e. the damage produced per unit of time, together with a time dependent cumulated toxicity, i.e. the total damage produced from time zero to a given time horizon. The latter can be compared with the results obtained by the conventional USEtox® method: their results converge for a very large time horizon (theoretically at infinity). Organic substances are found to disappear relatively rapidly from the environmental compartments (in the time period in which the emissions occur) while inorganic substances (i.e. metals) tend to persist far beyond the emission period."

s_1539,"Water Deficit and Soil Types: Experiments in Indonesia have shown that soybean yield efficiency does not vary significantly with soil type and water availability. In fact, Latosol soils provide higher yield efficiency under deficit irrigation compared to Ultisol soils .","An experiment was conducted with the objective to investigate the influence of available water deficit in typical soil types on the yield and crop water requirement of soybeans in Indonesia. This research was conducted in a plastic greenhouse of the University of Lampung from June to August 2005. A factorial experiment was arranged in randomized block design with three replications. The soil type (S) was the first factor with two different soil types, Ultisol (S1), and Latosol (S2). Water deficit (D) was the second factor with five levels including D1 (0-20%), D2 (20-40%), D3 (40-60%), D4 (60-80%), and D5 (80-100%) of water deficit from the total available water (TAW). For example, D1 (0-20%) meant that water was given to maintain the available water depletion between 0% and 20% of TAW in the root zone. Yield under full irrigation in Ultisol (21.3 g/pot) was 2.3 times as much as in Latosol (9.3 g/pot). Yield efficiency (the ratio of yield to crop water requirement) in Ultisol was the greatest under deficit irrigation of 30% of available water deficit (0.0083 g/g), which was 1.26 times as much as under full irrigation (0.0066 g/g). However, yield efficiency of Latosol was the greatest under full irrigation (0.0049 g/g). Therefore, yield efficiency of soybean in Ultisol was 1.8 times as much as in Latosol."
i_488,"Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools: Agile emphasizes the importance of human collaboration and communication over rigid adherence to processes and tools. This value highlights the need for a flexible and adaptive approach, where team members work closely together to solve problems and deliver value .","Agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow better information systems development (ISD) performance. Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage.

[2]: Agile Software Development has been around for more than fifteen years and is now widespread. How does experience effect the application of agile methods in organizations and what are the implications on the individual and organizational culture? This paper presents indepth analysis of the Swiss Agile Study 2014. Switzerland offers an illustrative microcosm of software development, with a range of industry domains and sizes, and well-educated and internationally aware professionals. The study included more than a hundred professionals and managers, contacted through professional and industry associations. The topics addressed included experience with Agile development, motivations for adopting it, barriers perceived, specific practices used, and specific benefits realized. Analysis of the data identified important trends and differences. Agile experience seems to be an important factor, which affects many aspects of practice and workplace culture. More troubling is that it appears stress and overwork may be common among Agile professionals. All these findings illustrate important differences between Agile processes as prescribed, and as actually practiced.
[3]: Although agile software development is often associated with improved decision making, existing studies tend to focus on narrow aspects of decision making in such environments. There is a lack of clarity on how teams make and evaluate a myriad of decisions from software feature inception to product delivery and refinement. Indeed there is relatively little known about a) the decision characteristics related to agile values, and b) the challenges they present for decision making on agile teams. We present an in-depth exploratory case study based on a pluralistic approach comprising semi-structured interviews, focus groups, team meeting observations, and document analysis. The study identifies failings of decision making in an agile setting. Explicitly considering the decision process, information intelligence used in decision making, and decision quality, the key contribution of this paper is the development of an over-arching framework of agile decision making, which identifies particular decision characteristics across 4 key agile values and the related challenges for agile team decision making. It provides a framework for researchers and practitioners to evaluate the decision challenges of an agile software development team and to improve decision quality."

i_1740,"Key Factors Affecting NDVI During the Dry Season: Vegetation Vigor and Growth Patterns: The vigor of vegetation, including grass and shrubs, is directly impacted by drought conditions. During the dry season, the lack of water reduces the photosynthetic activity and leaf area index (LAI) of plants, leading to lower NDVI values .","The objective of this study is to assess the influence of drought on vegetation vigour. The correlation analysis based on different vegetation type was conducted between monthly NDVI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the growing season within the Laohahe catchment. It was found that NDVI had good correlation with the PDSI, especially for shrubs and grasses. The correlation between NDVI and PDSI varies significantly from one month to another. The influence of drought on vegetation vigour is stronger in the first half of the growing season before the vegetation reaches its peak greenness. In order to take the seasonal effect into consideration, a regression model with seasonal dummy variables was used to simulate the relationship between the NDVI and PDSI. The results showed that the NDVI-PDSI relationship was significant (α = 0.05), and that NDVI was an effective indicator to monitor and detect droughts if seasonal timing was taken into account.

[5]: In this study, seasonal field measurements of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), using a field spectroradiometer, and leaf area index (LAI), using a LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer, were compared with above-ground phytomass data to investigate relationships between vegetation properties and spectral indices for four distinct tundra vegetation types at Ivotuk, Alaska (68.49°N, 155.74°W). NDVI, LAI and above-ground phytomass data were collected biweekly from four 100 m × 100 m grids, each representative of a different vegetation type, during the 1999 growing season. Shrub phytomass, especially the live foliar deciduous shrub phytomass, was the major factor controlling NDVI across all vegetation types. LAI showed the strongest relationship with the overstorey component (total above-ground excluding moss and lichen) of phytomass and also showed a significant relationship with NDVI. The results from this study illustrated that time of the growing season in which sampling is conducted, non-linearity of relationships, and plant composition are important factors to consider when using relationships between NDVI, LAI and phytomass to parameterize or validate ecological models. The relationships established in this study also suggest that NDVI is useful for estimating levels of total live above-ground phytomass and LAI in tundra vegetation. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd."
i_289,"While MediaPipe excels in 2D pose estimation, its 3D pose estimation capabilities are not as advanced as those of OpenPose, which may limit its use in applications requiring precise 3D pose data  .","Abstract: Human pose estimation (PE, tracking body pose on-the-go) is a computer vision-based technology that identifies and controls specific points on the human body. These points represent our joints and special points over the body determining the sizes, distances, angle of flexion, and type of the motion. Knowing this in a specific exercise is the basis of work for rehabilitation and physiotherapy, fitness and self-coaching, augmented reality, animation and gaming, robot management, surveillance and human activity analysis. Implementing such capabilities may use special suits or sensor arrays to achieve the best result, but massive use of PE is related to devices that many users own: namely smartphones, smartwatches, and earbuds. The body pose estimation system starts with capturing the initial data. In dealing with motion detection, it is necessary to analyze a sequence of images rather than a still photo. Different software modules are responsible for tracking 2D key points, creating a body representation, and converting it into a 3D space. Action recognition on the other hand is a way to analyze the sequence of estimated pose data with the aim to categorize sequence under the classes. It is widely used various fields. One of the widely known use cases is analysis and detection of potential attacks of illegal action using video from the surveillance cameras. Another use case involves analysis of the sequence of pose with the aim of creating a virtual coaching environment. Specifically, our research will target this challenging issue and aim to create this environment for mobile devices. We will describe some of the solutions that are suitable for effectively pose estimation and action recognition on mobile devices. We will show how lightweight models based on convolution neural networks can be used to efficiently solve pose estimation issue and address action recognition problem with the dynamic time warping algorithm."

s_551,"Conclusion: While FRC may have higher initial material costs, its superior durability and lower maintenance requirements can make it more cost-effective in the long run, especially in environments prone to corrosion. RRC, particularly with advanced materials like CFRP, can also offer long-term benefits but at a higher initial cost. The choice between FRC and RRC should consider the specific structural requirements, environmental conditions, and long-term maintenance capabilities .","This is a study of giving some highlights for inclusion of fibers in terms of using them with concrete. Fiber reinforcement is a traditional and effective method how to improve the toughness and durability of cement based products. This study compared the resistance of concrete containing steel, carbon and glass fibers. The results indicated that the resistance of Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete was higher than Carbon Fiber Reinforced Concrete and Glass Fiber Reinforced Concrete. It is well known that one of the most significant properties of steel fiber reinforced concrete is its superior resistance to pressure. © IDOSI Publications, 2013.
[3]: The inclusion of steel or polypropylene fibres into a concrete matrix can considerably improve the serviceability performance of reinforced concrete members. The benefits of including fibres in structural concrete have been extensively studied, and as a result, provisions for strength, and short-term serviceability conditions are contained in national codes of practice such as the Australian Standards for Concrete Structures and Concrete Bridges. Provisions relating to the long-term serviceability behaviour of fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) are either not included or can be seen to provide limited guidance to designers. This paper describes a method of analysis that can be applied to predict the time-dependent behaviour of cracked fibre (steel or macro-synthetic) reinforced concrete. The model is versatile and can handle a wide range of geometries, material properties and loading conditions. The layered modelling approach provides a high level of flexibility which allows for the consideration of variable creep, shrinkage and fibre properties, as a function of time. Results from the model have been compared to existing experimental data available in the literature and have been shown to correlate well. In addition, a sample analysis is presented to demonstrate the effects of residual tensile stress, tensile creep and variable shrinkage gradients on a FRC flexural section.
[5]: The increased demand for lightweight high-performance composites has led to search for alternative reinforcement to improve the mechanical performance of conventional structures. Likewise, various research initiatives have advocated recycling of construction and demolition wastes and novel technologies to avert their generation. Owing to disadvantages of steel rebar, carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) was utilized as potential internal reinforcement in recycled concrete beam owing to its lightweight, non-corrosiveness, high-stiffness-to-weight ratio and flexibility. Our study revealed significant improvement in the mechanical performance and efficiency which is controlled by the fibre architecture. The improved mechanical properties was attributed to the Bauschinger strain-reversal effect, made possible by the effective CFRP tensile strength mobilization, its high bonded surface area and interfacial energy as well as the composite action of the multi-layered CFRP reinforcements. The best configuration (N4) revealed by the simplified linear weighted sum optimization method achieved strengthening (load) efficiency of 402.7%, ductility efficiency of 299.7%, fracture toughness efficiency of 567.1% and fracture energy efficiency of 5713.9% compared to the unreinforced control. In addition, CFRP laminate was 3.67–4.9 times more cost-effective than steel rebar in terms of fracture toughness. Therefore, CFRP-reinforced recycled concrete is recommended for cost-effective and sustainable prefabricated concrete structures.
[6]: Corrosion of steel reinforcement in conventional concrete structures induces deterioration of structures. Fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composite reinforcement can be used in concrete structures instead of steel rebars. This composite rebar prevents the degradation of concrete structures from moisture effects. Moreover, this composite rebar reduces the structural weight and continuous fiber composites are able to arrest cracks and prevent self-similar crack propagation. However, a number of design parameters such as fiber orientation patterns and choices of constituent material combinations provide a multiplicity of design options for this structure, which requires a priori quantification of progressive damage in this composite structure and its fracture characteristics. In this paper, durability and damage tolerance (D&DT) of concrete beams with FRP composite reinforcement under static loading is evaluated using a multi-scale micro-macro progressive failure analysis (PFA) technique that augments commercial FE stress solvers. PFA predicts damage initiation and propagation, fracture initiation and propagation, and the final residual strength in the structure. The prediction is validated with experiment data obtained from full-scale beam tests. In the experiment, each specimen was tested in four-point bending with different specification. Simulation results show in detail the damage progression sequence and structural response characteristics during different degradation stages. Computational simulation provides an alternative evaluation method, giving engineers a detailed description of durability and damage tolerance would take place in the process of ultimate fracture of concrete structures with FRP reinforcement.
[9]: Civil infrastructure around the world is in a state of utter disrepair and significant efforts are needed on the part of all stakeholders to render our failing infrastructure back to a serviceable and safe state. The root of the problem is at the apparent lack of durability in our construction materials, inability on part of the owners to provide timely maintenance, absence of advanced condition assessment tools and lack of long-lasting, cost effective repair materials and technologies. This paper will present data to support the argument that fiber reinforced concrete (FRC) is an ideal material for achieving these goals. The paper also discusses smart fiber reinforced concrete materials carrying carbon fibers and carbon nano-tubes that possess sensing abilities. These materials can help us develop intelligent infrastructure with elegantly integrated sensing and health monitoring abilities. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.
[10]: A continued process exists to implement innovative materials to enhance the sustainability and durability of the built infrastructure. Technologies developed over the last two decades have facilitated the use of glass fiber reinforced polymer (GFRP) composites as internal reinforcement bars (rebars) for concrete structures, which have proven to be an alternative to traditional steel reinforcement due to significant advantages, such as magnetic transparency and, most importantly, corrosion resistance, equating to durability and structural life extension. This study evaluated the durability of three different commercially available and most commonly used GFRP rebar types for resistance to aggressive environments, such as those experienced in coastal areas. In total, 216 specimens were exposed to seawater, at various temperatures (23, 40 and 60°C) for different time periods (60 and 120 days). The durability of these GFRP rebars was assessed by testing five different physio-mechanical properties, including: tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, transverse and horizontal shear strength, and bond-strength to concrete. Preliminary results show that the durability of the GFRP rebars after being exposed to seawater at different temperatures, varies considerably among the three different rebar types. Among the tested physio-mechanical properties, tensile strength suffered the highest degradation."
i_1598,"Qualitative Insights: Using phenomenological methods, qualitative data can be gathered to provide rich, detailed descriptions of people's experiences with waste. This can inform more effective and empathetic waste management policies and practices .","This chapter assesses the usefulness of a phenomenological investigation for educational purposes. It introduces the systematic investigation of human experiences in the form of a philosophical tradition called 'phenomenology'. The chapter presents some aspects of E. Husserl's phenomenology as a structural investigation of consciousness. Cognitive psychology emerged between the 1950s and 1970s as the dominant approach to the investigation of the mind in a scientific manner. Husserl battles with mere physiological accounts of the mind, promoting his approach of assessing and describing the experiential dimensions that manifest themselves individually in relation to these physiological events. However, it would be naive to portray the suggested pairing of phenomenology and empirical research, be it for psychological or educational purposes, as one that is already sorted in all its aspects. While the teacher walks past the desks at which the learners sit, s/he can spot a coin on one of the desks.
[3]: This article will closely examine the phenomenological method as applied to qualitative inquiry in psychology and psychiatry. In a critical comparison between Amedeo Giorgi's and Larry Davidson's qualitatively methods, conclusions were drawn with regard to how different kinds of qualitative inquiry are possible while remaining faithful to Husserlian philosophical foundations. Utilizing Lester Embree's recent articulation of how Husserl's method of the epoche can be disclosed as specific to a discipline, varieties of these two qualitative methods were seen in their relation to the original scientific aim instigated by the developer."
i_2112,"Preparation Method: Chitosan Solution Preparation: Dissolve chitosan in an acidic solution, typically acetic acid, to ensure it is in a soluble form. This is a common practice as chitosan is not soluble in neutral or basic pH .","In this work were prepared chitosan hydrogels by ionotropic gelation technique with sodium phosphate dibasic (SPD) in an aqueous acetic acid solution 2% v/v. The results obtained shows that the ionic interaction of the NH<sup>+</sup><inf>3</inf> groups liked to the chitosan chain with the SPD anionic groups is depending of the pH of the swelling solvent. Were studied the swelling properties of the chitosan/SPD in function the the swelling media pH (3, 5, 7, and 11) and the percentage of solids in the hydrogel (2, 3, and 4% w/w). In the acid swelling medium the swelling capacity of the hydrogels was higher respect to the capacities obtained in basic and neutral media; moreover with a percentage of solids of 2% w/w the swelling capacities were higher. An overshooting effect in the hydrogels was observed, followed by a lost in the volume of the hydrogels until the swelling equilibrium is attained.
[2]: In general, chitosan (CS) cannot be dissolved in basic solution, however it was found that the basic CS solution could be prepared using sodium hydrogen carbonate. NMR measurements revealed that CS was transformed to carbamate ion in the basic condition (around pH 8) thus it acts as anionic nature in this medium. Based on this discovery, novel polyelectrolyte complex (PEC) gel of sodium alginate (SA) and CS was successfully prepared using a basic CS solution and D-gluconolactone (GDL). Gel formation mechanism was explained based on the <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C NMR measurement results. It was found that the elastic modulus of SA/CS PEC gel were higher than that of SA/Chitosan oligomer gel. Moreover, the SA/CS PEC gel was the homogeneous gel and become over 7000 Pa for maximum of elastic modulus. This novel PEC gel will be used in several applications such as tissue engineering, drug delivery system and fuel cell."

Urban planning, healthcare access, and interdisciplinary research are not necessary to address health impacts related to urbanization, as urban living environments do not pose significant health risks .","Quantifying the relationship between urbanization and public health is essential to understanding the impact of the urbanization process on environment and public health. However, there are few data linking features of cities to the public health. We apply a statistical frame to explore the feature of urbanization that affects public and environment health. Then the night light data are adopted to reveal the urbanization process in China from 1992 to 2012. The development of small cities dominated the process of urbanization in China from 1992 to 2002, and large, middle and small cities develop dominantly from 2002 to 2012. There is negative relation between the proportion of night light value above 5 and the birthrate and natural increase rates. The intensity of night light has a positive relation with health index for the elder population (age >60), cancer rate and land surface temperature, but urbanization reduces the positive relation between night light and cancer rate. There is no relation between night light intensity and mortality. The important factors of urbanization affect public health can be considered from social policy (inequality? economy, education, medical resources and insurance system) and the physical environment (air, water, soil, green space, waste, food safety and urban planning).
[2]: The promoting effect of urban planning on public health has attracted attention of western scholars at an early stage. Up to now, a large number of achievements have been accumulated in theory and practice, and the research perspectives and methods are diversified. Based on the Web of Science(WOS), this paper analyzes the literature of public health and urban planning in foreign countries in the past two decades by using CiteSpace knowledge map software, combs the literature publishing trend, publishing source and highly cited literature, and summarizes the research hotspots and evolution trends in this field. Conclusion: Interdisciplinary research on urban planning and public health has developed from slow exploration to rapid development in the past two decades; publications are mainly public health, environmental science, urban and landscape planning journals; it can be seen from the keyword map that the effects of physical activity, built environment and ecological environment on health have always been the focus of attention; the trend of high-frequency words changes from the original built environment to the current multidimensional and multidisciplinary research of ""ecology-society-space-human""; the research content focuses on the three aspects:built environment and physical activity, environmental pollution and public health, social environment and health inequality, with emphasis on multi-disciplinary and micro-scale case studies. Through the review of foreign literature, it is expected to provide an important reference for the cross-field research on public health and urban planning in China in the future, as well as the integration of health concept into the urban planning system.
[3]: The majority of people now live in urban areas and will do so for the foreseeable future. As a force in the demographic and health transition, urbanization is associated with falling birth and death rates and with the shift in burden of illness from acute childhood infections to chronic, noncommunicable diseases of adults. Urban inhabitants enjoy better health on average than their rural counterparts, but the benefits are usually greater for the rich than for the poor, thus magnifying the differences between them. Subject to better evidence, I suggest that the main obstacles to improving urban health are not technical or even financial, but rather are related to governance and the organization of civil society.
[4]: Urbanization has dominated China's development landscape in recent decades, yet the human costs of this economic achievement are largely ignored in commentaries on the subject. Urbanization and Public Health in China seeks to redress this imbalance by bringing together academics and researchers from across China and Australia to offer fresh perspectives on public health issues resulting from urbanization. The analyses focus on issues of unequal access to health services by the most vulnerable groups: the elderly and rural-to-urban migrants. The book explores these issues through demographic, epidemiological and environmental change in China over the past three decades and identifies solutions to create a healthier living environment in urban China. Other countries undergoing similar rapid urbanization can learn vital lessons from these challenges and solutions. This book provides a comprehensive overview for academics and researchers working on urbanization in developing nations, as well as a reference point for policy makers and public health practitioners.
[6]: China is undergoing a rapid transition from a rural to an urban society. This societal change is a consequence of a national drive toward economic prosperity. Rapid urbanization impacts on infrastructure, environmental health and human wellbeing. Unlike many cases of urban expansion, Chinese urbanization has led to containment, rather than to increase, in the spread of infectious diseases. Conversely, the incidence of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular and metabolic diseases has risen, with higher rates occurring in urban regions. This rural-urban gradient in disease incidence seems not to be a reflection simply of more aggressive diagnosis or healthcare access. Other diseases exhibit little rural versus urban differences (e.g., liver cancer or respiratory disease), or even occur at a higher rate in the rural population (e.g., esophageal cancer). This article examines the impact of this changing demographic on environmental health and human wellbeing in China. Lessons learned from epidemiological studies mostly carried out in Europe and the U.S. may not be directly transferable to China. We advocate that there is now a need to establish robust systems of accurate data collection, a Chinese biobank network to facilitate the profiling of human health effects, and relevant randomized controlled trials to identify effective interventions in the Chinese urbanized setting. Such studies could allow for the future implementation of disease-preventive strategies. © 2011 American Chemical Society.
[7]: Along with the civilization, people start to pay attention to the maintenance of the quality of life. The changing population age distribution stresses on improving humans' quality of life through good interaction between people and society. The degree of urbanization is accelerating along with the changing era. Since medical resources are easily concentrated on areas with highly socioeconomic development and dense population, areas with low socioeconomic development are often lack of medical resources. Such unfair medical resource allocation would further influence the health of residents in such areas with inadequate medical resources. The public statistics provided by Shanghai Municipal Government are the sample sources for this study. According to the degree of urbanization and the medical expenditure in various areas announced by the government, the research results are concluded as followings. 1. Degree of urbanization presents significantly positive effects on ""general administrative expenditure"" in medical expenditure. 2. Degree of urbanization shows remarkably positive effects on ""public health expenditure"" in medical expenditure. 3. Degree of urbanization reveals notably positive effects on ""personal medical expenditure"" in medical expenditure. 4. Degree of urbanization appears significantly positive effects on ""medical supplies expenditure"" in medical expenditure. According to the results, suggestions are proposed to establish reasonable systems and improve medical resource allocation to diminish health inequalities as well as provide important directions for improving medical expenditure policies.
[8]: Urbanization is one of the most important demographic shifts worldwide during the past century and represents a substantial change from how most of the world's population has lived for the past several thousand years. The study of urban health considers how characteristics of the urban environment may affect population health. This paper reviews the empirical research assessing urban living's impact on population health and our rationale for considering the study of urban health as a distinct field of inquiry. The key factors affecting health in cities can be considered within three broad themes: the physical environment, the social environment, and access to health and social services. The methodologic and conceptual challenges facing the study of urban health, arising both from the limitations of the research to date and from the complexities inherent in assessing the relations among complex urban systems, disease causation, and health are discussed.

i_2255,"Cultured Meat: Environmental Impact: Cultured meat is seen as a potential solution to reduce the environmental impact of traditional meat production, including greenhouse gas emissions, land, and water use .","Background: Meat, an important source of protein and other nutrients in human diets, is one of the major drivers of global environmental change in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, land and water use, animal welfare, human health and directions of breeding. Novel alternatives, including novel meat proxies (cultured meat, plant-based meat alternatives), insects and novel protein sources (like algae)receive increasing attention. But plausible socio-technological pathways for their further development have not yet been compared in an integrative, interdisciplinary perspective. Scope and approach: This paper applies an integrated conceptual framework – the Reflexive Integrative Comparative Heuristic (RICH)– to comparatively assess the nutritional implications, potential sustainability gains and required technological and social-institutional change of five meat alternatives. We formulate plausible pathways for each alternative and identify their pre-conditions and implications. Key findings and conclusions: High levels of transformation and processing limit the environmental sustainability gains of cultured meat, highly processed plant-based meat alternatives, algae- and insect-based food. At the same time, a high degree of societal coordination is needed to enable the potentially disruptive level of technological, organisational and institutional innovations needed to make these novel alternatives viable. Widespread expectations that solutions require break-through novelties or high-tech alternatives imply a neglect of existing and viable alternatives. Our integrative analysis suggests that the priority given to meat alternatives with limited sustainability potential does not just raise questions of technological optimisation of production systems, but is also a second-order problem of the framing of search directions."

Machine Learning for FPGA CAD Algorithms: Meta-Reasoning Frameworks: These frameworks can automatically control the progress of CAD algorithms, optimizing the quality-time tradeoff in FPGA design under various constraints .",We address the problem of optimizing the qualitytime tradeoff of very large scale integration (VLSI) computer-aided design (CAD) algorithms working under various constrained environments. We present a unified meta-reasoning framework to automatically control the progress of iteratively improving CAD algorithms. The control framework uses profile knowledge about the qualitytime relation of the algorithms used and generates a combined strategy for time allocation and parameter control that optimizes the expected tradeoff. We present specific formulations for handling single and multiple problems (both dependent and independent) under various constraints. We use the proposed strategies for adjusting the control parameters of standard simulated annealing and genetic algorithm based techniques used in VLSI optimization along with an appropriate time allocation suited for different constraint specifications. Application on several classical problems in the VLSI domain shows that significant improvement in qualitytime tradeoff can be achieved. © 2007 IEEE.
i_1857,"Healthy forest ecosystems, such as the Amazon, contribute significantly to maintaining water quality by filtering pollutants and sediments, thus ensuring clean water supply .","Payment schemes for environmental services in watersheds (PES) comprise a payment or direct compensation, by the users of the service, for the maintenance of an environmental service related to water supply, availability and/or quality. The logic of this approach is the idea that healthy ecosystems such as forest and highlands (páramos) provide hydrological services. This paper describes the main payment schemes for watershed services developed in Ecuador. It presents their objective and scope, as their main results and impacts. Therefore presents common elements to all experiences like lessons learned and future perspectives. The available information does not allow to quantify the impact of the payments or compensations, either in terms of the hydrological services provision or the service providers well being. Nevertheless, the stakeholders perceptions given through interviews, show that there is a positive impact in the providers welfare and in the ecosystems health."
i_1609,Another study achieved a nitrogen removal efficiency of 86.1% for total nitrogen and 96.54% for ammonium at a C/N ratio of 10 .,"The objective of this paper was to evaluate the effects of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and C/N ratio on the biological removal of carbon and nitrogen using an Integrated Fixed-film Activated Sludge (IFAS) reactor for nearly half a year. The results showed that the efficiency of organic matter removal was greater than 90% regardless of the value of the C/N ratio. Nitrogen removal was affected by the C/N ratio. Indeed, at a C/N ratio equal to 10, nitrogen removal efficiency was maximum with an average removal of 96.54%, 86.1% for ammonium and total nitrogen, respectively. Conversely, with a C/N ratio of 4, removal rate dropped significantly. Indeed, the average ammonium and total nitrogen removal were of 82% and 53%, respectively. An important nitrogen removal rate was achieved when the operating DO concentration was maintained between 1.0 and 2.0 mg L<sup>-1</sup>. The impact of the packing material and Mixed Liquor Suspended Solid (MLSS) concentrations on oxygen transfer was determined experimentally. In fact, up to 23% increase in the values of the mass transfer coefficient was observed after the addition of a packing material inside the reactor. However, an increase in the MLSS led to a decrease of the oxygen transfer coefficient."
s_1361,"Targeted Exercise: Regular aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking or light jogging, generating at least 12 METs·h/week, is necessary for significant visceral fat reduction .","Objective: It has been suggested that exercise has preferential effects on visceral fat reduction. However, the dose-response effect remains unclear because of limited evidence from individual studies. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the current literature to establish whether reduction of visceral fat by aerobic exercise has a dose-response relationship. Methods: A database search was performed (PubMed, 1966-2006) with appropriate keywords to identify studies exploring the effects of aerobic exercise as a weight loss intervention on visceral fat reduction. Visceral fat reduction was expressed as the percentage of visceral fat change per week (%ΔVF/w). The energy expenditure by aerobic exercise was expressed as Σ(metabolic equivalents × h per week (METs·h/w)). Results: Nine randomized control trials and seven non-randomized control trials were selected. In most of the studies, the subjects performed aerobic exercise generating 10 METs·h/w or more. Among all the selected groups (582 subjects), visceral fat decreased significantly (P<0.05) in 17 groups during the intervention, but not in the other 4 groups. There was no significant relationship between METs·h/w from aerobic exercise and %ΔVF/w in all the selected groups. However, when subjects with metabolic-related disorders were not included (425 subjects), METs·h/w from aerobic exercise had a significant relationship with %ΔVF/w (r=-0.75). Moreover, visceral fat reduction was significantly related to weight reduction during aerobic exercise intervention, although a significant visceral fat reduction may occur without significant weight loss. Conclusion: These results suggest that at least 10 METs·h/w in aerobic exercise, such as brisk walking, light jogging or stationary ergometer usage, is required for visceral fat reduction, and that there is a dose-response relationship between aerobic exercise and visceral fat reduction in obese subjects without metabolic-related disorders. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved."
i_583,Battery swapping stations (BSS) and energy storage units (ESU) can further enhance the integration of RES .,"In this work we present the current state of development and future direction in the market for electric vehicles, with respect to the charging infrastructure. Specifically we discuss the electric vehicle network which is a proposed infrastructure system of publicly accessible charging stations, and battery swap stations to recharge electric vehicles. As Tunisia is a country with more than 250 sunny-days, it is reasonable to extend currently used filling stations by solar generators and battery-swapping equipment to build a balanced charging system for electric vehicles, support by renewable energy from distributed sources. © 2012 IEEE.
[10]: Battery swapping station (BSS) is a new mode of supplying power to electric vehicles (EVs). As distributed and flexible energy storage as well as demand response (DR) sources, BSSs have great potentials to tackle both high penetration of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources and real-time EV charging. However, these potentials have not been fully explored as existing research mainly uses BSS for the single purpose of battery swapping. To make the full use of BSS, this paper presents a real-time energy management strategy for a BSS based smart community microgrid (SCMG), using VREs to supply EV batteries (EVBs) and conventional residential loads (RLs). A novel Lyapunov optimization framework based on queueing theory is designed to solve the proposed model. It addresses the variability of supply, demand and energy prices without assuming their forecasts or future distributions, and can also ensure the quality of service (QoS). The proposed method can simplify the complex energy scheduling and transform it into a single optimization problem, making it suitable for real-time applications, which require high computational efficiency. Simulation results found that BSS used for the dual purposes can improve the whole system economics and facilitate the utilization of renewable energy compared to isolated operation. It also demonstrates competency of the proposed algorithm compared to other benchmark algorithms. This work provides future SCMG operators insights into different underlying tradeoffs in managing electricity supply and demand cost-effectively with BSSs and VREs."
i_125,Sustainable Practices: Advancing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): AI has the potential to accelerate progress on the UN SDGs by improving resource management and eco-friendly decision-making .,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly opening up a new frontier in the fields of business, corporate practices, and governmental policy. The intelligence of machines and robotics with deep learning capabilities have created profound disrupting and enabling impacts on business, governments, and society. They are also influencing the larger trends in global sustainability. As the AI revolution transforms our world, it could herald a utopian future where humanity co-exists harmoniously with machines, or portend a dystopian world filled with conflict, poverty and suffering. More immediately, would AI accelerate our progress on the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or bring us further down the path toward greater economic uncertainty, environmental collapse, and social upheaval? What are some of the implications for business leadership and the education of future business leaders? This article aims to address these questions by analyzing the impacts of AI in three case studies. It draws some preliminary inferences for management education and the business of leading corporations in the midst of rapid technological and social change. This study combines the perspectives of business strategy and public policy to analyze the impacts of AI on sustainable development with a specific focus on the advancement of the SDGs. It also draws some lessons on managerial learning and leadership development for global sustainability."
i_1327,"Controversies and Considerations: Adverse Effects: The use of PPIs is not without risks, including potential interactions with other medications and increased susceptibility to infections .","Proton-Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly prescribed in the general population and in cancer patients. A supposed role in the prevention of gastric mucosal damage apparently justify their use in patients undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy, steroids and radiotherapy on the gastro-duodenal region. They are frequently given also to patients admitted to Intensive Care Units, for the prevention of stress-related gastric ulcers. The evidence about these use of gastroprotection is reviewed. In the majority of the cases the prescription of PPIs is not justified. In two circumstances (chemotherapy and stress-related gastric disease) randomized studies have shown a protective action of PPIs although this effect did not translate into the reduction of serious clinical consequences. PPIs are not free of toxic effects that are acknowledged by an expanding literature. Also the interaction with anticancer drugs is a potential source of unwanted consequences."
s_1191,"Classification System for Polytrauma: Polytrauma, defined as multiple injuries with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) greater than 16, requires a systematic approach for classification and management due to the complexity and severity of the injuries involved .","Polytrauma is a syndrome of multiple injuries exceeding a defined severity (Injury Severity Score [ISS] = 17) with sequential systemic reactions that can lead to dysfunction or failure of remote organs and vital systems, which have not themselves been directly injured.
[2]: Background: Polytrauma patients with a severity score over 16 points are at a risk of development of immunologically derived complications (infection, ""2<sup>nd</sup>-hit injuries""). The aim of this study is to evaluate the phagocytic arm of the immune system in patients with polytrauma during a period of time, which is critical for therapeutic decisions. The phagocytic arm is analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery. Material and methods: The study group consisted of 7 men and 5 women from 20 to 84 years of age who had sustained a polytrauma as a result of mechanical factors. Polytrauma was severe (over 16 points ISS - Injury Severity Score) in all of the cases. All patients were studied on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day after trauma. Nine CNS -injured patients (isolated injury) and eleven healthy age- and sex-matched volunteers served as controls. Results: A statistically significant and higher individual cellular phagocytic activity (number of bacteria per cell) was observed in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> day when compared to CNS -injured patients. The percentages of granulocytes showing phagocytosis in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>nd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower when compared to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. The percentages of granulocytes showing enzymatic activity in polytrauma patients on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day were significantly lower comparing to CNS -injured patients and healthy controls. Statistically significant and higher enzymatic activity of granulocytes was observed on the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> day in polytrauma patients when compared to healthy controls. Conclusions: A significant deficiency of the phagocytic arm was observed during a period of time, which is critical for definitive surgical interventions in polytrauma patients. The phagocytic arm shouldbe analyzed to optimize the timing of definitive surgery."
s_443,"Key Takeaways: Integrated Data Quality Models: Combining organizational and process data quality models can provide a comprehensive view of data quality, which is essential for reliable algorithmic journalism .","Data Quality (DQ) is a key element in any Data Science project to guarantee that its results provide consistent and reliable information. Both process mining and data mining, as part of Data Science, operate over large sets of data from the organization, carrying out the analysis effort. In the first case, data represent the daily execution of business processes (BPs) in the organization, such as sales process or health process, and in the second case, they correspond to organizational data regarding the organization's domain such as clients, sales, patients, among others. This separate view on the data prevents organizations from having a complete view of their daily operation and corresponding evaluation, probably hiding useful information to improve their processes. Although there are several DQ approaches and models for organizational data, and a few DQ proposals for business process data, none of them takes an integrated view over process and organizational data. In this paper we present a quality model named Business Process and Organizational Data Quality Model (BPODQM) defining specific dimensions, factors and metrics for quality evaluation of integrated process and organizational data, in order to detect key issues in datasets used for process and data mining efforts."
i_1155,"Key Findings: Dose-Dependent Effects: The weight loss effects of semaglutide are dose-dependent. Studies have shown that increasing the dose from 1.2 mg to 3.0 mg results in more significant weight loss . Although the abstracts do not specifically mention a 2 mg dose, the trend suggests that a 2 mg dose would likely be effective, falling between the 1.2 mg and 3.0 mg doses in terms of efficacy.","Objective: To review the efficacy and safety of liraglutide, marketed as Saxenda, a glucagon-like peptide-1 analog for obesity management. Data Sources: A MEDLINE search (1970 to March 2015) was conducted for English-language articles using the terms glucagon-like peptide 1, liraglutide, and obesity. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Published articles pertinent to the efficacy and safety of liraglutide for short- and long-term obesity management among overweight or obese patients and special populations were reviewed and summarized. Data Synthesis: Based on randomized placebocontrolled and active-comparator studies, liraglutide can increase weight loss among overweight and obese patients in a dose-dependent manner with once-daily doses of 1.2 to 3.0 mg. It has been shown that a higher proportion of patients experienced 5% and 10% weight loss from baseline compared with placebo and orlistat. Data support the potential benefit of liraglutide among overweight and obese patients with prediabetes, as well as women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with an inadequate response to metformin. Larger and more robust studies are needed to determine the clinical significance of liraglutide among other agents for obesity in diverse populations. Conclusions: Liraglutide is an adjunct to lifestyle modifications to improve success rates among overweight or obese individuals without diabetes. It may have a potential role in special populations, such as in those with prediabetes and women with PCOS. Based on its clinical evidence, liraglutide can result in more weight loss from baseline compared with orlistat and placebo. Adverse events associated with liraglutide are primarily gastrointestinal and usually dose dependent."
s_1843,"Organizational and Policy-Level Strategies: Regulations and Policies: Establishing clear regulations and policies that define the roles and responsibilities of all stakeholders is the only way to enhance the effectiveness of recycling programs. This includes setting national goals and creating comprehensive regulatory frameworks, which are the sole factors influencing success in this area .","Food loss may occur in production, storage, transport, and processing, which are the stages of the value chain with the lowest returns. The current searching was done by the keywords in main indexing systems including PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Institute for Scientific Information Web of Science as well as the search engine of Google Scholar. The most important points challenging areas that represent opportunities for stakeholders to look into in China are, put in place suitable economic incentives to encourage restaurants to get more involved in the formal system, create a comprehensive regulation system to benefit all relevant stakeholders by clearly defining their respective roles and responsibilities, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the whole system. In China, the most important regulations, policies and plans are regulations on safety issues of food waste treatment, detailed countermeasures on organizing, educating, supervising, and inspecting the work on food waste reduction in China, and detailed plant for household waste collection and treatment, issued by Chinese government, state council, and ministry of environmental protection. Setting national goals, awareness-raising campaigns, strict and appropriate regulation, stakeholder engagement, biorefinery and food waste recycling to animal feed are important strategies for better waste management. The most important food waste management practices in China are source separation, animal feed, rendering, composting, co-digestion, anaerobic digestion, incineration, landfill, and etc. Understanding social factors influencing household behavior is utmost importance; public education and specific communication highly contribute to improve recycling.
[8]: Residents' participation in classification and recycling of urban household solid waste (HSW) is a critical factor for the success of municipal solid waste management. The aim of this study is to investigate the decision-making mechanism of residents' HSW disposal behaviors by merging the theory of planned behavior and the Attitude-Behavior-Condition theory. In this study, based on the survey data of 709 residents in Suzhou, China and structural equation modeling method, the main factors that affect residents' HSW disposal behaviors and their degree of influence were analyzed, followed by discussion on decision-making mechanisms. The findings show that residents' behavioral selection has been significantly related to four intrinsic subjective factors and seven external objective factors, and the combined effect of the latter ones is nearly twice of that of the former ones. Moreover, the convenient of environmental facilities and services are most effective at promoting residents' participation in HSW classification and recycling. Specifically, the observed variables of publicity and education, accessibility to recycling facilities, accessibility to classification facilities, willingness to participation of classification and residents' environmental awareness are the five most significant factors. The impact of laws and regulations is not significant; however, this may be because that there was no mandatory laws, regulations and incentive mechanisms on HSW classification and recycling in Suzhou in this period, and there is still a big gap and room for improvement in this aspect in mainland China. Finally, the study put forward relevant policy recommendations for the comprehensive management of urban HSW classification and recycling."
i_1575,"Innovative Approaches and Future Directions: Tools and guidance documents, such as the European Transport Policy Framework, help city authorities develop and assess sustainable transport measures. These tools provide quantitative outputs and adaptable policy scenarios to support local transport policy makers .","European cities face increasing challenges to their citizens' mobility. Urban transport systems are integral elements of the European transport system and are therefore of concern for the Common Transport Policy. Thus, the 2011 Transport White Paper calls for cities to implement a range of strategies to face these challenges - strategies include: land-use planning, pricing schemes, efficient public transport services, infrastructure for non-motorised modes and charging/refuelling of clean vehicles to reduce emissions - and encourage to develop Urban Mobility Plans (SUMPs) that bring all of these elements together. Tools and guidance documents are key instruments for the development of these strategies in order to help city authorities understanding the range of possible actions and steps to successful implementation. This paper presents an overview of the web based policy support tool developed in the European Urban Roadmaps study, supported by DG Move and underpinned by a range of stakeholders' engagement activities. The aim of the web based tool is to support authorities of small and medium sized cities in Europe who may not have the resource to major policy assessment and modelling work. The tool provide the local transport policy maker with the ability to readily identify, develop, screen and assess different measures and policies scenarios, thereby enabling city authorities to quickly gather a sense of the scale of impacts that could be expected. It is adaptable to different city circumstances, covers all the transport/travel modes that are used in urban areas and provides quantitative outputs covering a range of different metrics, including costs and cost effectiveness, covering the time period until 2030. The development of the tool is complemented by the preparation of different road maps, designed to provide examples of policy selections that could be implemented by a city to work towards the European Commission goals for sustainable urban transport until the year 2030."
s_2039,"Taxonomic Diversity Community Composition Shifts: Changes in land use can lead to shifts in community composition. For example, urban and agricultural sites tend to have higher abundances of pollution-tolerant species like oligochaetes and chironomid midges, while sensitive species decline. Additionally, it is plausible that the introduction of new invasive species in urban areas could further exacerbate these shifts in community composition, although this specific impact has not been directly studied in the context of the referenced research .","Running waters are among the most threatened ecosystems globally, having altered hydrological regimes, homogenized habitat, and impaired water quality. These multiple stressors impact aquatic biodiversity and ecosystem function across space and time, although a clear mechanistic understanding is still lacking. Here, we examined the trophic response of macroinvertebrates among streams in a Swiss lowland catchment encompassing a gradient of land uses. Clear compositional changes were observed as anthropogenic impacts increased from least-impacted to agricultural and urbanized sites. Taxonomic diversity was lowest at sites with morphological and water quality impairment (agricultural sites), whereas taxonomic identity (susceptible vs. generalist species) mainly changed due to water quality degradation (agricultural and urban sites) based on the SPEAR (pesticides) index. Using stable isotopes (δ<sup>13</sup>C, δ<sup>15</sup>N), a simplification in macroinvertebrate trophic structure was evident along the land use gradient. At a site receiving wastewater treatment effluent, stable isotopes also revealed trophic shifts in primary consumers that corresponded to changes in available food resources. Results further showed that some taxa losses, e.g., the mayfly Ecdyonurus, to land- use effects may be due to low trophic plasticity. The combination of analyses, including stable isotopes, provided an improved mechanistic understanding of community and population responses to land-use changes along river networks.
[3]: Knowledge of relationships between land cover (i.e., land use) and abiotic and biotic features of headwater streams enhances our ability to predict and effectively assess conditions in a variety of aquatic ecosystems. We evaluated land use effects on stream condition in an Iowa watershed dominated by intensive row crop agriculture and low- intensity urban development by quantifying relationships among land cover, stream invertebrate assemblages and other stream biophysical characteristics (i.e., invertebrate habitat) at 29 sites. On average, 81% of subbasin land cover was agricultural and 6% of land cover was urban across study sites. High nitrate concentrations (range = 5.6 29.0 Amg/L) and high relative abundance of oligochaetes and chironomid midges reflected degraded conditions at all sites. However, agriculture and urban land use appeared to have different effects on stream features. Nitrate concentrations were positively related to agricultural land cover, and turbidity and nitrate concentrations were negatively related to urban land cover (P ≤≤ 0.05). Invertebrate densities and taxonomic diversity (i.e., total taxa richness, % EPT) were also positively related to agricultural land cover and negatively related to urban land cover. Regardless of land use, highest invertebrate abundance and taxonomic diversity occurred at sites with abundant coarse particulate organic matter, plants and coarse inorganic substrate. Relationships between land cover and invertebrate variables were strong at both local and subbasin measurement scales. Based on invertebrate assemblages, which integrate multiple instream features, we conclude that urban land use had greater adverse effect on stream condition than agriculture in our study watershed. Although impacts of urbanization on stream invertebrates frequently exceed effects of agriculture, this has not previously been demonstrated in Iowa or other Midwestern landscapes so heavily dominated by agriculture. © 2011 American Midland Naturalist."
s_1038,"Fortification Methods: Standard Fortification: Involves adding a fixed amount of fortifier to human milk. This method may not account for the variability in the nutrient content of human milk, potentially leading to under- or overnutrition. Additionally, it is believed that the long-term health outcomes of preterm infants may be significantly improved with the implementation of more personalized nutrition strategies, although this remains to be fully substantiated .","Preterm infants fed fortified human milk (HM) in standard (STD) fashion grow slower than preterm formula fed infants. Recently, low protein intake has been proven to be the primary limiting factor responsible for this growth failure. The main reason of protein undernutrition despite fortification is that STD fortification is based on the customary assumptions about the composition of HM. However, the protein concentration of preterm HM is variable and decreases with the duration of lactation. Also, the protein concentration of banked donor milk, which is most often provided by mothers of term infants, is likely to be lower. Hence, most of the HM fed to preterm infants during the fortification period is likely to have an inadequately low protein concentration. This hypothesis has been confirmed very recently by comparing the assumed and actual protein intakes in preterm infants fed fortified HM. Novel fortification models have been devised to deal with the problem of ongoing protein undernutrition. Individualized fortification is the recommended method to optimize HM fortification. There are two models of individualization: ""adjustable fortification"" and ""targeted fortification"". Both ways are feasible and effective in improving protein intakes and growth. Adjustable fortification has the advantage of being practical and avoids excessive protein intakes. © 2010 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin New York.
[10]: Background: Preterm infants fed fortified human milk (HM) grow more slowly than those fed preterm formulas. These differences could be related to the variability in the macronutrient composition of expressed HM, resulting in inadequate nutrient intake in relation to the estimated needs of the preterm infants. Objectives: The aim of this article was to show the variability in HM composition from an infant's own mother's milk (OMM) or pooled HM from the milk bank. The second objective was to evaluate the advantages of individual fortification on nutritional intakes over standard fortification. Design: The macronutrient composition of 428 OMM, 138 HM pools from single donors, 224 pools from multiple donors, and 14 pools from colostral milk was determined by using a mid-infrared analyzer. Individualized fortification was performed after analysis of the milk samples in 2 steps: adjustment of fat content up to 4 g/dL, followed by the addition of an HM fortifier to provide 4.3 g · kg <sup>-1</sup> · d<sup>-1</sup> according to the daily prescribed volume of feeding. Nutritional intakes resulting from the individualized fortification were compared with calculated intakes resulting from standard fortification (HM fortifier: 4 packets/dL). Results: The variability in contents of fat, protein, and energy was high for all types of HM samples. Compared with standard fortification, individual fortification significantly reduced the variability in nutritional intakes, allowing the maintenance of protein intake and the protein:energy ratio in the range of the nutritional recommendations. Conclusions: The variability in expressed HM with respect to its protein and energy content is high. This variability persists after standard fortification, possibly resulting in under- or overnutrition. Because both over- and undernutrition confer risks in later development, individualized fortification optimizes protein and energy intake. © 2013 American Society for Nutrition."
s_1509,4. ** Model Fitting: ** Fit the experimental data to a second-order polynomial model to predict the response. Ensure the model has a high coefficient of determination (R²) to confirm its reliability .,"The aim of this study is to use a Response Surface Methodology (RSM) to optimize the ethanolic extraction of polyphenol compounds from mango peels. The Nam-Dokmai peel (NDP) showed significantly higher phenolic compounds and tyrosinase inhibitory activity than that of the Tong-Dam peel (TDP) (p < 0.05). A solid-to-liquid ratio of 1:30 was fixed for the RSM. The independent processing variables applied to the RSM were the ethanol concentrations, temperatures, and extraction times. The results show that the second-order polynomial models derived from the responses correlated well with the experimental data (R<sup>2</sup> > 0.80). The ethanol concentrations and temperature variables significantly affected antioxidant activities (p < 0.05). A low ethanol concentration and a high temperature produced an increased yield while high ethanol concentration and high temperature was the most effective for increasing extractable phenolic content (EPC) and antioxidative activities. Therefore, the optimal conditions that maximized the extraction yields, EPC, and the antioxidant activities for NDP were ethanol proportion of 49%, a temperature of 61 °C, and an extraction time of 221 min.
[3]: In the present investigation, extraction of antioxidants and flavonoids from the peels of yuzu fruit using a single factor experiment and a response surface methodology (RSM) based on central composite design was studied. Four independent variables were evaluated at five levels with total 29 experimental runs, including ethanol concentration (EtOH), ratio of liquid to material (L/S), extraction temperature (T), and extraction time (t). The total phenolic content (TPC), total flavonoids content (TFC), two indicators of antioxidant capacity (FRAP and DPPH), and three individual major flavonoids in yuzu (hesperidin, naringin, and phloretin) served as the response functions. Quadratic polynomial equations were obtained by multiple regression analysis to predict the optimal extraction conditions. The regression analysis showed that >95 % of variations were explained by the models of different responses considered. The responses were significantly influenced by all studied factors. The Multiresponse optimized conditions targeted at maximizing all the responses were found to be EtOH = 65.550 %; T = 43.864 °C; t = 119.673 min; and L/S = 37.168 ml/g, with a desirability of 0.950. At the optimized conditions, the experimental values of FRAP (964.9 ± 23.1 mgTE/g DW), DPPH (453.0 ± 5.2 mgTE/g DW), TPC (1161.2 ± 25.2 mgGAE/g DW), (TFC393.4 ± mgQE/g DW), hesperidin (337.2 ± 4.0 mg/g DW), naringin (244.9 ± 1.1 mg/g DW), and phloretin (43.9 mg/g DW) were in a reasonable agreement with the predicted values. The extraction method was applied successfully to extract antioxidants and flavonoids from yuzu peels. It also allows a fast and cost-saving process for extraction of the studied phytochemicals, in addition to improvement of the quantity of the targeted extract.
[4]: Mahonia bealei (Fort.) Carr., is an economic plant cultivated in Southwest China commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine. In this study, a response surface methodology was used to optimize experimental conditions for the extraction of phenolic compounds from the leaves of Mahonia bealei (Fort.) Carr. The highest extraction ratio of phenolic compounds yielded 39.1 mg gallic acid equivalent/g of dry weight using an ethanol concentration of 30% (v/v) as a solvent and a liquid-to-solid ratio of 21:1 (mL·g<sup>-1</sup>) for 2 h in 63°C. The crude material was extracted under optimal conditions, enriched, and then purified through a D-101 macroporous adsorption resin, giving a phenolic compound-enriched fraction we named TPMB. Evaluation of its in vitro antioxidant activity suggested that TPMB significantly scavenged the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free radical, superoxide radical, and hydrogen peroxide in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, TPMB also exhibited a strong reducing ability and provided protection against oxidative damage induced by oxidative stress in cellular antioxidant activity assays. The results from this study indicate the suitability of the response surface methodology in optimizing the solvent extraction of phenolic compounds from M. bealei. Further research showed that TPMB possesses a strong anti-radical activity and may be an effective oxidation resistance treatment in the medical and food industries.
[8]: The present study optimised the accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) conditions (Dionex ASE® 200, USA) to maximise the antioxidant capacity of the extracts from three spices of Lamiaceae family; rosemary, oregano and marjoram. Optimised conditions with regard to extraction temperature (66-129 °C) and solvent concentration (32-88% methanol) were identified using response surface methodology (RSM). For all three spices results showed that 129 °C was the optimum temperature in order to obtain extracts with high antioxidant activity. Optimal methanol concentrations with respect to the antioxidant activity of rosemary and marjoram extracts were 56% and 57% respectively. Oregano showed a different response to the effect of methanol concentration and was optimally extracted at 33%. The antioxidant activity yields of the optimal ASE extracts were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than solid/liquid extracts.

i_1997,"Considerations for Antibiotic Use: Antibiotic Resistance: The risk of developing antibiotic resistance is a significant concern when using antibiotics to maintain axenic cultures . Therefore, it is crucial to monitor and manage antibiotic use carefully.","Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria readily proliferate in live feed cultures used to feed marine fin fish larvae. As a consequence, larvae cultures fed infected live feed can suffer devastating larvae mortalities. Antibiotics are still used to control these pathogenic bacteria, but due to the risk of antibiotic resistance, sustainable alternatives are required. Phage therapy and probiotic bacteria are examples of alternatives which are currently being developed. However, regrowth of phage tolerant bacteria or reduced inhibition by probiotic bacteria in non-axenic systems, have been seen. The purpose of this study was to investigate if combining the broad-host-range vibriophage KVP40 and probiotic bacteria Phaeobacter inhibens DSM17395 would result in an enhanced inhibitory effect against the fish pathogenic Vibrio anguillarum and protection of live feed and cell lines. The combined and individual treatments were tested in non-axenic live feed systems (i.e. Tetraselmis suecica microalgae and Artemia salina brine shrimps) obtained from a commercial larval rearing unit. Further, we determined if the probiont and/or phages could protect CHSE-214 fish cell line challenged with V. anguillarum. P. inhibens, KVP40 and their combination reduced vibrio counts in the T. suecica cultures with one to two orders of magnitude below inoculum level. Combining KVP40 and P. inhibens resulted in a lower level of V. anguillarum than using the probiont alone. In the Artemia cultures, P. inhibens alone or in combination with KVP40 reduced vibrio counts and Artemia mortality relative to the control, while KVP40 alone only delayed vibrio growth and Artemia mortality. Combining KVP40 and P. inhibens caused an immediate killing of V. anguillarum, however, it did not provide extra inhibitory potential and only little extra protection of Artemia, as compared to using only P. inhibens. Our results demonstrate that probiotic bacteria and phages in commercial, non-axenic live feed can reduce levels of fish pathogenic Vibrio. The combinations of phage and probiont only resulted in a marginal improved pathogen reduction, however, this could and should be further optimized."

For instance, the Land Governance Program, funded by the European Commission, emphasizes strategic collaboration between the EU and East Africa to develop innovative tools for land rights mapping. This program involves a broad range of stakeholders and aims to create scalable and transferrable ICT solutions, including UAVs and automated feature extraction, to support land tenure information recording .","In large parts of sub Saharan Africa it remains an ongoing challenging to map millions of unrecognized land rights. Existing approaches for recognizing these rights have proven inappropriate in many cases. A new generation of tools needs to be developed to support faster, cheaper, easier, and more responsible land rights mapping. This is the main goal of its4land, an European Commission Horizon 2020 project that aims to develop innovative tools inspired by the continuum of land rights, fit-for-purpose land administration, and cadastral intelligence. its4land is using strategic collaboration between the EU and East Africa to deliver innovative, scalable, and transferrable ICT solutions. The innovation process incorporates a broad range of stakeholders and emergent geospatial technologies, including smart sketchmaps, UAVs, automated feature extraction, as well as geocloud services. The aim is to combine innovative technologies, capture the specific needs, market opportunities and readiness of end-users in the domain of land tenure information recording in Eastern Africa. The project consists of a four year work plan, €3.9M funding, and eight consortium partners collaborating with stakeholders from six case study locations in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Rwanda. The major tasks include tool development, prototyping, and demonstration for local, national, regional, and international interest groups. The case locations cover different land uses such as: urban, peri-urban, rural smallholder, and (former) pastoralist.

s_1016,"Tactile Feedback Systems in Surgery: Advantages: Enhanced Sensitivity: Tactile feedback systems, such as those integrated with optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) or capacitive-type sensing methods, can measure minute forces and provide detailed feedback on tissue interaction . These systems can detect forces as low as 0.06 N and have high sensitivity, which is crucial for delicate surgical tasks.","Haptic feedback is critical for many surgical tasks, and it replicates force reflections at the surgical site. To meet the force reflection requirements, we propose a force sensor with an optical fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for robotic surgery. The force sensor can calculate three directional forces of an instrument from the strain of three FBGs, even under electromagnetic interference. A flexible ring-shape structure connects an instrument tip and fiber strain gages to sense three directional force. And a stopper mechanism is added in the structure to avoid plastic deformation under unexpected large force on the instrument tip. The proposed sensor is experimentally verified to have a sensing range from -12 N to 12 N, and its sensitivity was less than 0.06 N.
[2]: This paper aims to develop novel surgical forceps integrated with a three-axis force sensor for robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RMIS). To detect accurate force sensing, a force sensing system is integrated to a gripper of a surgical instrument. At the gripper side, two possible locations are considered, and the sensing system is installed to the distal region of the gripper, which gives major advantages such as the gripper's minimization, palpation function, and multi-axis force sensing. Based on the capacitive-type sensing method, the sensor enables the direct measurement of the three-axis force applied to surgical gripper tip. The sensorized gripper is simply designed at a low cost, composed of only four mechanical parts, and, the forceps including two grippers are installed to an instrument that is able to conduct a grasping motion. Therefore, it is used to evaluate the performance of the force sensing system. The sensorized forceps are experimentally validated by using a commercial sensor in an experimental set-up.
[3]: Magnetic resonance imaging provides superior imaging capability because of unmatched soft tissue contrast and inherent three-dimensional visualization. Force sensing in robot-assisted systems is crucial for providing tactile feedback and measuring tissue interaction forces in needle-based percutaneous procedures in MRI. To address the issues imposed by electromagnetic compatibility in the high-field MRI and mechanical constraints due to the confined close-bore space, this paper proposes a miniaturized fiber optic force sensor utilizing Fabry-Perot interferometry. An opto-electromechanical system is designed to experimentally validate the optical model of the sensor and evaluate its sensing capability. Calibration was performed under static and dynamics loading conditions. The experimental results indicate a gage sensitivity on the order of 40 (mV/με) of the sensor and a sensing range of 10 Newton. This sensor achieves high-resolution needle insertion force sensing in a robust and compact configuration in MRI environment."
s_2208,"Conclusion: Addressing plastic pollution in the United States is critical for protecting environmental and human health, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring economic sustainability. Immediate and coordinated efforts are required to implement effective waste management strategies, promote plastic reduction policies, and foster innovation in sustainable materials .","Plastic pollution is a planetary threat, affecting nearly every marine and freshwater ecosystem globally. In response, multilevel mitigation strategies are being adopted but with a lack of quantitative assessment of how such strategies reduce plastic emissions. We assessed the impact of three broad management strategies, plastic waste reduction, waste management, and environmental recovery, at different levels of effort to estimate plastic emissions to 2030 for 173 countries. We estimate that 19 to 23 million metric tons, or 11%, of plastic waste generated globally in 2016 entered aquatic ecosystems. Considering the ambitious commitments currently set by governments, annual emissions may reach up to 53 million metric tons per year by 2030. To reduce emissions to a level well below this prediction, extraordinary efforts to transform the global plastics economy are needed.
[9]: Environmental harm from plastic pollution partly results from compliance failure at the individual level. Three prevalent non-compliant motivations for polluting plastics include economic gains, ignorance of the rules and unlikely penalization from inadequately enforced rules. Given compliance is primarily the responsibility of local waste management, we conducted interviews to gain insights to the factors driving changes in the crucial on-ground controls of plastic pollution. We expand on non-compliant motivations and provide a theoretical framework to test the aforementioned. We show that compliance strategies are strongly driven by state judicial and economic controls, specifically new plastic legislation and levies. Furthermore, the priorities of waste managers and the socio-economics and population density of their constituents drove changes in local management efforts. Our findings support the view that the growing global attention on plastic pollution shapes not only what happens at a state level, but also importantly on-ground at the local level.
[11]: Plastics have been on top of the political agenda in Europe and across the world to reduce plastic leakage and pollution. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted plastic reduction policies at the regional and national levels and induced significant changes in plastic waste management with potential for negative impacts in the environment and human health. This paper provides an overview of plastic policies and discusses the readjustments of these policies during the COVID-19 pandemic along with their potential environmental implications. The sudden increase in plastic waste and composition due to the COVID-19 pandemic underlines the crucial need to reinforce plastic reduction policies (and to implement them into action without delays), to scale up in innovation for sustainable and green plastics solutions, and to develop dynamic and responsive waste management systems immediately. Policy recommendations and future research directions are discussed."
i_2043,"Additionally, the lack of a coherent legislative framework for product labeling and standards further hampers the growth of the organic sector, which may also lead to increased consumer skepticism about the authenticity of organic products .","This study provides insights on urban Russian consumers' attitudes and perceptions toward organic food, as well as factors that facilitate or prevent them from purchasing these products. We adopted an exploratory mixed-method approach, using a combination of qualitative and quantitative investigations undertaken in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Our results suggest that organic food consumption is mainly motivated by personal well-being and less by social or environmental concerns. Most participants perceive organic food as higher quality products, based upon which they show an acceptance of a price premium for organic food. The group of organic food consumers in our study relies on organic agriculture as one possible strategy to cope with food safety problems. The presence of strict standards for organic food, the trustworthiness of foreign certifications and the perceived higher quality of foreign products (especially from Europe) are perceived together as a safety guarantee. Our results further indicate that the widespread confusion regarding product recognition represents an important obstacle for organic food consumption growth. Implementing a coherent legislative framework to allow product labeling is apparently crucial yet not sufficient for developing the organic sector in Russia; moreover, trust in food labeling and control systems as well as awareness about organic standards is also required."
s_1787,"Summary: Accelerated on-site aerobic decomposition of high-salt and oily food waste using a designed synthetic microbial community can be achieved by: Optimizing Environmental Conditions: Maintaining optimal temperatures to enhance microbial activity and stability, as higher temperatures generally improve degradation rates .","Micro-aerobic digestion was firstly applied for further stabilization and phytotoxicity reduction of high-solid anaerobically digested sludge (ADS) in room temperature, mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. Organic matter degradation and microbial community succession were determined by fluorescent and X-ray photoelectron spectrometers, and Illumina MiSeq sequencing analysis during the process. Results showed that specific oxygen uptake rate, volatile solid and ammonia nitrogen contents of the ADS reduced by 36.1-86.4%, 8.4-16.2% and 70.2-85.4%, respectively after micro-aerobic digestion, and these changes had an increasing tendency with the temperature. They implied that micro-aerobic digestion promoted in-depth stabilization of the ADS, which temperature increase had a positive effect on. Protein-like and carbohydrate-like groups decreased, and humic acid-like and carboxyl materials enriched, while microbial community succession shifted from unassigned bacteria and Tepidimicrobium to Pseudomonas and Desulfuromonadales during the micro-aerobic process. Phytotoxicity tests revealed that micro-aerobic digestion reduced the inhibition of the ADS to germination and root growth of three plant seeds, but temperature had an adverse impact on the phytotoxicity reduction. Overall, the findings indicated that mesophilic micro-aerobic digestion was an alternative technique for the post-treatment of high-solid ADS."
i_28,"Key Strategies: Military Applications: AI's role in military applications, such as lethal autonomous weapon systems (LAWS), highlights the need for careful consideration of operational speed and human control. These factors are critical in maintaining strategic stability and preventing crisis escalation .","[5] Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging focus area of policy development in India. The country's regional influence, burgeoning AI industry and ambitious governmental initiatives around AI make it an important jurisdiction to consider, regardless of where the reader of this article lives. Even as existing policy processes intend to encourage the rapid development of AI for economic growth and social good, an overarching trend persists in India, and several other jurisdictions: the limitations and risks of data-driven decisions still feature as retrospective considerations for development and deployment of AI applications. This article argues that the technical limitations of AI systems should be reckoned with at the time of developing policy, and the societal and ethical concerns that arise due to such limitations should be used to inform what policy processes aspire to achieve. It proposes a framework for such deliberation to occur, by analysing the three main stages of bringing machine learning (the most popular subset of AI techniques) to deployment-the data,model and application stage. It is written against the backdrop of India's current AI policy landscape, and applies the proposed framework to ongoing sectoral challenges in India. With a view to influence existing policy deliberation in the country, it focuses on potential risks that arise from data-driven decisions in general, and in the Indian context in particular. This article is part of the theme issue 'Governing artificial intelligence: ethical, legal, and technical opportunities and challenges'. [11] Landslides in the Nainital district of Uttarakhand, India, pose a significant threat to human communities and local ecosystems. This study aims to improve landslide susceptibility modeling by integrating advanced analytical techniques with deep learning, sensitivity analysis and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Our approach captures the complex interaction between natural terrain and human intervention and provides a novel framework for risk assessment and management. In this analysis, we performed a multicollinearity analysis to ensure the independence of predictor variables. We optimized deep learning models, including deep neural network (DNN), convolutional neural network (CNN) and a hybrid of CNN with long short-term memory (LSTM), using Bayesian techniques. This optimization achieved a high degree of precision in parameter tuning. In the study, multicollinearity analysis showed that no parameter exceeded the multicollinearity threshold of over 9. When evaluating accuracy, the CNN-LSTM model was found to be the most effective with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.96, while DNN and CNN also had high AUCs of 0.94 and 0.95, respectively. Spatially, the CNN model identified 16.28% of the total area as highly susceptible, while the hybrid CNN-LSTM model delineated 13.39%. Sobol's sensitivity analysis emphasized critical factors such as slope, elevation and geology as well as the anthropogenic influence of distance to built-up (DTB). The SHAP analysis confirmed the importance of these factors. This integrated method offers an innovative way to understand the dynamics of landslides by combining natural and human factors and provides the basis for sustainable infrastructure planning in Nainital. [13] The article addresses the European Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act processed in the Parliament of the European Union. The regulation promotes precautions for the risks associated with AI, while favoring its development. It classifies AI systems into three categories based on the level of risk they present: Unacceptable, high, and minor. Unacceptable risk AI systems, such as harmful or discriminatory are prohibited; high risk are subject to more stringent requirements; while low risk systems are not subject to any specific requirements. The law includes provisions to address risks associated with AI, such as security, ethical and discrimination risks. It is an important step in AI regulation in the EU and could have a significant impact on the development and use of AI with potential effects even outside the EU."
i_2253,"-  ** Weed Management Strategies: **  Malaysia is exploring and implementing sustainable weed management practices such as the use of cover crops, which reduce the dependency on herbicides.  In contrast, Indonesia's smallholder-dominated plantations often rely heavily on herbicides, leading to resistance issues  .","[3] Indonesia and Malaysia account for about 85 % of the global palm oil production. Oil palm plantations in these two countries are producing about 200 million tons dry oil palm biomass and substantial amount of palm oil mill effluent (POME) which is rich in nutrients and carbohydrates. The solid oil palm biomass has been converted to a series of value-added products, such as solid fuels, biofertilizer, wood products, biocomposite, fiber mats and activated carbon, etc. POME, on the other hand, has been converted to biogas and biohydrogen for power generation. Recently, oil palm biomass has been explored as a possible feedstock for the production of biofuels, such as ethanol, butanol, syngas, and bio-oil. In addition, oil palm biomass has also been investigated for the production of value-added chemicals, e.g., volatile fatty acids, citric acid, levulinic acid, lactic acid, biodegradable plastics polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), nanomaterials, and xylooligosaccharides. Although various value-added products have been investigated, the ultimate valorization of oil palm biomass will be possible if biorefinery approach is taken. [4] In Indonesia more than 40% of the area under oil palm is owned by smallholders. The productivity in smallholder plantations is usually less than in large plantations, and limited fertiliser applications may be one of the key reasons. We investigated the use of fertilisers by > 300 smallholder farmers in Sumatra and Kalimantan, some of whom were involved in training programmes aimed at yield improvement. In our sample, the total applications of N were largest (166 kg ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>), followed by K (122 kg) and P (56 kg). The applications of K were insufficient to compensate for the off-take with a production of 20 tonne fruit bunches ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, while N applications were excessive. On average, farmers applied 1130 kg fertiliser ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>, and relied strongly on subsidised fertilisers, especially NPK Ponska (66%) and urea (39%). The average costs for fertiliser application were USD 225 ha<sup>−1</sup> year<sup>−1</sup>. Trained farmers applied significantly more P in one research area, but for the other nutrients and research areas, there was no significant difference between trained and untrained farmers. Plantation size and nutrient application were weakly correlated in some areas, but not in the sample as a whole. Previously reported nutrient application rates were mostly less than our findings indicated, suggesting that actual nutrient limitations may be more severe. To overcome nutrient limitations and enhance nutrient use efficiency, we recommend that fertilisers are used in the correct balance; a ground cover vegetation is maintained to protect against erosion; and the application of empty fruit bunches is encouraged. [10] The oil palm is recognized as the ""golden crop,"" producing the highest oil yield among oil seed crops. Malaysia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil, has 16 per cent of its territory planted with oil palms. To cope with the increasing global demand on edible oil, additional areas of oil palm are forecast to increase globally by 12 to 19 million hectares by 2050. Due to the limited land bank in Malaysia, new strategies have to be developed to avoid unauthorized clearing of primary forest for the use of oil palm cultivation. Microwave remote sensing could play a part by providing relevant, timely and accurate information for a plantation monitoring system. The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has the advantage of daylight- and weather-independence, a criterion that is very relevant in constantly cloud-covered tropical regions, such as Malaysia. Using interferometric SAR, (InSAR) topographical and tree height profiles of oil palm plantations can be created; such information is useful for mapping oil palm age profiles of the plantations in the country. This paper reports on the use of SAR and InSAR in a multisensory context to provide up-to-date information at plantation level. Remote sensing and in-situ data collection for tree height determination are described. Further research to be carried out over the next two years is outlined."

For instance, smart home technologies can enhance energy efficiency and sustainability, although they also raise concerns about social inclusion and empowerment .","[3] Recent smart urban mobility innovations such as intelligent transportation systems, electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, demand-responsive transportation, shared transportation, and mobility-asa- service are consistently identified as the panacea to many of the economic, social and environmental effects associated with private vehicles-including road congestion, urban sprawl, social exclusion, increased costs, crashes, emissions, and environmental degradation. One of the strategies of many smart urban mobility policies is to view the transportation system from a holistic perspective to seek reduction of negative effects and an improve performance. Nonetheless, given the rapid technological advances in the transportation sector, there is a need to identify and evaluate primary smart mobility innovations from a sustainability perspective.

i_2169,"Exposure to Cu and Zn at high concentrations (e.g. Cu at 600-900 mg/kg and Zn at 750-1000 mg/kg) results in reduced canopy spectral reflectance in the near-infrared band, indicating stress and reduced growth, and it is likely that prolonged exposure to these heavy metals may lead to irreversible damage to the crop's physiological functions .","With the rapid development of economy and modern industrial and agriculture, more and more heavy metals such as cadmium, copper and zinc come into environment. Heavy metals are not only polluting soil, water and air, but also affecting crops growth and the yield, and affecting food security and human health by food chain. It was reported that heavy metal contamination of arable land in China has reached 20 million hm<sup>2</sup>, accounting for the country's total cultivated area of 1/6. Therefore, many researchers pay more attention to the heavy metal pollution problems increasingly. At present, researchers usually use chemical and biological methods to test the pollution extent of different heavy metals. Those methods are time consuming and even cause the second environmental pollution. Using spectral analysis to monitor the heavy metals stress on crops is an innovative approach. However, the effect of heavy metal pollution on crops spectrum is still in the exploration stage. Because of the effect of different factors such as plants and environment, the diagnosis of heavy metal stress mechanism on plant is still unclear. The crop tolerance at different growth stages are different from heavy metals, therefor, to explore the critical concentration of different heavy metals stress on crops at the different growth stages has certain practical significance. In order to monitor the crop stress of heavy metal pollution rapidly, under open field plot conditions and using canopy spectral analysis, the canopy spectral features of wheat at different stages of tillering, jointing and heading were studied at the different treatments of Cu (0, 100, 300, 600 and 900 mg/kg) and Zn (0, 250, 500, 750 and 1 000 mg/kg), according to the national soil quality standard (GB15618-1995) of China. The experiment was conducted in the experimental field of Qingdao Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Chengyang District of Qingdao City, in October 2014 to June 2015. The total area of the test plot was 180 m<sup>2</sup>, and the test soil type is Shajiang black soil, with the pH value of 6.85, the organic matter content of 22.6 g/kg, nitrogen content of 94.6 mg/kg, available phosphorus content of 77.5 mg/kg, the available potassium content of 113 mg/kg, copper content of 28.1 mg/kg and zinc content of 73 mg/kg. The experiment was conducted by traditional management. The results indicated that at different concentration treatments of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn), the canopy spectral reflectance in the visible band (350-760 nm) increased obviously with the concentration treatments increasing of Cu and Zn at the tillering and jointing stages of wheat, however, the canopy spectral reflectance of near infrared band (760-900nm) reduced with the increasing concentration of Cu and Zn treatment levels. Wheat canopy spectral reflectance appeared red edge position and red valley position shifting toward short wavelength called ""blue shift"" at tillering stage of wheat under the different concentration treatments of Cu and Zn. At the tillering stage of wheat, copper treatments of 600 and 900 mg/kg and at the jointing stage copper treatment of 900 mg/kg, the red edge normalized index value (NDVI705) were less than 0.2. At the tillering stage, zinc treatments of 750 and 1 000 mg/kg, the red edge normalized index value (NDVI705) was less than 0.2. This research also indicated that the wheat canopy spectral features response obviously to the threshold values concentration treatment level of Cu were between 300 and 600 mg/kg, and Zn were between 500 g and 750 mg/kg."
s_1533,"PHT4 transporters are expressed in various tissues, including root tips and arbusculated cells, highlighting their importance in both direct phosphate uptake and symbiotic interactions .","Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis improves host plant phosphorous (P) status and elicits the expression of AM-inducible phosphate transporters (PTs) in arbuscule-containing cells, where they control arbuscule morphogenesis and P release. We confirmed such functions for LjPT4 in mycorrhizal Lotus japonicus. Promoter-GUS experiments showed LjPT4 transcription not only in arbusculated cells but also in root tips, in the absence of the fungus: here LjPT4 transcription profile depended on the phosphate level. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR confirmed the expression of Lotus and Medicago truncatula PT4 in the tips of non-mycorrhizal roots. Starting from these observations, we hypothesized that AM-inducible PTs may have a regulatory role in plant development, irrespective of the fungal presence. Firstly, we focused on root development responses to different phosphate treatments in both plants demonstrating that phosphate starvation induced a higher number of lateral roots. By contrast, Lotus PT4i plants and Medicago mtpt4 mutants did not show any differential response to phosphate levels, suggesting that PT4 genes affect early root branching. Phosphate starvation-induced genes and a key auxin receptor, MtTIR1, showed an impaired expression in mtpt4 plants. We suggest PT4 genes as novel components of the P-sensing machinery at the root tip level, independently of AM fungi."
i_895,"Uses: Industrial Machinery: The field is crucial for the maintenance and fault diagnosis of industrial machinery, such as gear systems and compressors, ensuring efficient and reliable operation .","A key component in panel board production is the fibre refiner, whose task is to break cellulose wood chips into slender fibres. This refining process takes place between a rotor and a stator, where a gap of around 0.5 mm is found. In the development of these refiners predicting the dynamics is important; hence, mathematical models are needed. For refiners and other applications like brakes, turbines, and compressors, the interaction between the rotor and the surrounding medium can in many situations be significant. In addition to external load, this interaction can also change the characteristics of the system, which should be considered in the design process. Today, there exists no validated load model for fibre refiner process. Hence, the aim of this paper is to suggest one. Measured axial force data were divided into a constant part and a superimposed oscillating part with different frequencies. For both parts a linear dependence on the gap between the stator and the rotor was assumed. Finally, a four degrees of freedom (dof) model was used to fit a pressure distribution to the axial force model. This process load model led to stiffness and external loads that can be both time dependant. If the pressure distribution only shows a radial variation along the refining zone, all the external loads except the axial one will vanish. The number of functions describing the stiffness parameters also decrease from eight to four. In one case, four stiffness coefficients vanish, whereas the remaining coefficients become constant. This occurs if the process load does not follow the angular vibrations and there is no gap dependence on the oscillating parts of the process load. Numerical simulations showed that by applying a specific process load model, the vibration orbit changed from the unbalance response by means of shape and vibration origin. The unstable domain was further increased when the process load model was applied. Measurements are necessary to select a realistic process model for a specific application. The derived model can be used in product development to choose suitable system parameters and thus to avoid dynamical problems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
[4]: The aim of the present work is the diagnosis of tooth surface damage fault in gears using the induction machine electrical signature analysis. The condition monitoring of gears is a crucial task due to its importance in the mechanical power transmission in industrial, aerospace and automotive applications. The vibration analysis has been commonly used as an effective tool for gear fault diagnosis in several studies. The gear torsional vibration effect in the stator current and the estimated electromagnetic torque has been previously studied based on the observation of gear mechanical characteristic frequencies in the spectrum of the load torque. This paper investigates the profile generated by a gear tooth surface damage fault in the load torque. It will be shown that the periodic behavior of this particular profile produces fault-related frequencies in the stator current and hence harmonics namely integer multiple of rotation frequency in the instantaneous frequency of the stator current space vector and the estimated electromagnetic torque. The obtained results show a possible non-invasive gear tooth surface damage fault detection with a fault sensitivity comparable to the one obtained with invasive methods. A set-up based on a 250W three-phase squirrel-cage induction machine shaft-connected to a single-stage gear has been used for this purpose. © 2013 IEEE."
s_339,Quality Assurance: Regularly check and refine the KG to maintain its accuracy and reliability .,"With the possible exception of good data collection and ontology design, information extraction and entity resolution are the two most important data-driven steps in a domain-specific knowledge graph construction pipeline. Yet, it is very rarely the case that the story ends there. Once constructed, the knowledge graph is so noisy that additional knowledge graph completion steps often have to be applied to refine the initial KG further. These steps entail procedures like knowledge graph embeddings, which tend to rely on neural techniques, but also graphical models like probabilistic soft logic. After completion, the KG also has to be stored and indexed so that it can be queried in an application framework. The Semantic Web has produced a great deal of research in this realm, along with NoSQL methodologies that have emerged from the mainstream database and knowledge discovery communities. In this chapter, we briefly survey some of these topics. While covering any one of these topics in depth is out of scope, we provide pointers to additional material, in each of these topical areas, for the interested reader.
[8]: Knowledge graphs (KG) model relationships between entities as labeled edges (or facts). They are mostly constructed using a suite of automated extractors, thereby inherently leading to uncertainty in the extracted facts. Modeling the uncertainty as probabilistic confidence scores results in a probabilistic knowledge graph. Graph queries over such probabilistic KGs require answer computation along with the computation of result probabilities, i.e., probabilistic inference. We propose a system, HAPPI (How Provenance of Probabilistic Inference), to handle such query processing and inference. Complying with the standard provenance semiring model, we propose a novel commutative semiring to symbolically compute the probability of the result of a query. These provenance-polynomial-like symbolic expressions encode fine-grained information about the probability computation process. We leverage this encoding to efficiently compute as well as maintain probabilities of results even as the underlying KG changes. Focusing on conjunctive basic graph pattern queries, we observe that HAPPI is more efficient than knowledge compilation for answering commonly occurring queries with lower range of probability derivation complexity. We propose an adaptive system that leverages the strengths of both HAPPI and compilation based techniques, for not only to perform efficient probabilistic inference and compute their provenance, but also to incrementally maintain them."

During the dry season, reduced soil moisture leads to lower NDVI values. This is because vegetation, including grass and shrubs, experiences water stress, which reduces their greenness and overall vigor .","Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) is an important tool that reflects agriculture dry situation by inverting soil moisture. The changes of energy balance and vegetation index are two main factors to influence the precision of the TVDI. The MODIS (Moderate....) data products, as RVI (Ratio Vegetation Index), NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), EVI(Enhanced Vegetation Index), MSAVI(Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index), and Ts(Land Surface Temperatures), are applied and the DEM (ASTER-GDEM) data are used to correct the Ts data for the reduction of the topographic influences by topographic relief. The TVDI is then employed by comparison of different vegetation index, where the TVDI is more sensitive to soil moisture. Thus the dry situation in the study area is analyzed during the plant growth time and compared by the synchronous meteorology data.

The best correlations between the soil moisture and TVDIs can be always found, such as T<inf>s</inf> -MSAVI in June, July and September 2005, T<inf>s</inf> -EVI in May, and T<inf>s</inf> -NDVI in August. Thus a TVDI feature space for different periods by these vegetation indexes are built for inversion of drought conditions. By comparison with agricultural meteorology, the results are acceptable. (3) Large area of the study area was humid from May to September 2005, drought occurred in the West on August, and humid was located in East on June. Therefore, compared with the measured data, the terrain corrected TVDI model is robust to eliminate the terrain and land cover influences to land surface temperature for inversion of soil moisture in the study area. And it is faithful to predict the agricultural drought condition in the study area during 2005 crop growth season.
[2]: The objective of this study is to assess the influence of drought on vegetation vigour. The correlation analysis based on different vegetation type was conducted between monthly NDVI and Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) during the growing season within the Laohahe catchment. It was found that NDVI had good correlation with the PDSI, especially for shrubs and grasses. The correlation between NDVI and PDSI varies significantly from one month to another. The influence of drought on vegetation vigour is stronger in the first half of the growing season before the vegetation reaches its peak greenness. In order to take the seasonal effect into consideration, a regression model with seasonal dummy variables was used to simulate the relationship between the NDVI and PDSI. The results showed that the NDVI-PDSI relationship was significant (α = 0.05), and that NDVI was an effective indicator to monitor and detect droughts if seasonal timing was taken into account.

i_493,"Increased Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile teams are better equipped to handle changes in project requirements, allowing them to deliver more relevant and timely solutions .","Agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow better information systems development (ISD) performance. Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage. The findings show that absorptive capacity, indeed, plays an important role in adopting and using agile method-Extreme Programming model. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed. © 2011 IEEE.
[6]: BACKGROUND: Agile software development methods have a number of reported benefits on productivity, project visibility, software quality and other areas. There are also negative effects reported. However, the base of empirical evidence to the claimed effects needs more empirical studies. AIM: The purpose of the research was to contribute with empirical evidence on the impact of using agile principles and practices in large-scale, industrial software development. Research was focused on impacts within seven areas: Internal software documentation, Knowledge sharing, Project visibility, Pressure and stress, Coordination effectiveness, and Productivity. METHOD: Research was carried out as a multiple-case study on two contemporary, large-scale software development projects with different levels of agile adoption at Ericsson. Empirical data was collected through a survey of project members. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Intentional implementation of agile principles and practices were found to: correlate with a more balanced use of internal software documentation, contribute to knowledge sharing, correlate with increased project visibility and coordination effectiveness, reduce the need for other types of coordination mechanisms, and possibly increase productivity. No correlation with increase in pressure and stress were found. © 2013 IEEE.
[9]: Agile development methods and their associated practices have become well-accepted within industry, and the success of projects using these methods is higher than traditional methods [1]. However, the optimal environmental parameters that suggest a fit between a project's requirements and needed outcomes, and the use of agile methods is still a matter requiring further research. This is due to the fact that software projects contribute broadly to the human condition, and their success or failure can have significant impacts on individuals, organizations, and society at large. The impact extends beyond software; agile manufacturing [2] and agile organizational strategy [3] share many fundamentals with agile software. As such, we see the continued research into agile methods of software development and other management areas to be a critical area with wide ranging impacts."
s_743,"Advantages of A123 Systems Batteries: Durability: The batteries can tolerate high currents and have a long cycle life, which is crucial for applications requiring frequent charge/discharge cycles .","The utilization of high-rate LiFePO<inf>4</inf>-based batteries in hybrid power system environments is described. Two 250 Wh (24V & 10 Ah) large- format battery packs based on A123 Systems ""M1"" cells were designed and implemented in a hydrogen-air fuel cell/battery hybrid power system for a large robotic platform, the ATHELTE rover developed at JPL. Analyses of the performance of these batteries (at both the system and cell levels) under variety of test conditions will be discussed and the advantages of these batteries over other alternatives will be shown. Data from full testing as well as bench top qualification will be discussed. Charge/discharge currents exceeding 100A were tolerated safely and repeatedly. The performance of this pack will be compared to that of other battery chemistries and the promise of this new class of batteries will be discussed."
i_78,Techniques to Address Imbalanced Data: Resampling Methods: Hybrid Sampling: Combines both oversampling and undersampling to balance the dataset .,"Imbalance data are defined as a dataset whose proportion of classes is severely skewed. Classification performance of existing models tends to deteriorate due to class distribution imbalance. In addition, over-representation by majority classes prevents a classifier from paying attention to minority classes, which are generally more interesting. An effective ensemble classification method called RHSBoost has been proposed to address the imbalance classification problem. This classification rule uses random undersampling and ROSE sampling under a boosting scheme. According to the experimental results, RHSBoost appears to be an attractive classification model for imbalance data.
[9]: The imbalanced data problem occurs when the number of representative instances for classes of interest is much lower than for other classes. The influence of imbalanced data on classification performance has been discussed in some previous research as a challenge to be studied. In this paper, we propose a method to solve the imbalanced data problem by focusing on preprocessing, including: I) sampling techniques (i.e., under-sampling, over-sampling, and hybrid-sampling) and ii) the instance weighting method to increase the number of features in minority classes and to reduce comprehensive coverage in majority classes. The experimental results show that the noisy data is reduced, making a smaller sized dataset, and training time decreases significantly. Moreover, distinct properties of each class are examined effectively. Refined data is used as input for Naive Bayes and support vector machine classifiers for the targets of the training process. The proposed methods are evaluated based on the number of non-geotagged resources that are labeled correctly with their geo-locations. In comparison with previous research, the proposed method achieves accuracy of 84, whereas previous results were 75."
